FOREWORD
The Ritual of Battle is a benchmark in Indology; it is in some ways the culmination of a long series of approaches
to the great Epic formulated for many decades before it, and it has proved to be the source of a whole series of new
approaches in the decade that has followed its original publication, leading on to other important works including
Alf Hiltebeitel's own on-going, multivolume, epic study of Draupadi. His debt to the more recent past is to several
giants primarily Georges Dumézil, Madeleine Biardeau, J. A. B. van Buitenen, Victor Turner, and Mircea Eliade
whose shoulders provide what turns out to be not so much a resting place as a springboard for his own contribution
to the never-ending parampara of Mahabharata * studies. The book abounds in theories which appear far-fetched
at first but are invariably substantiated that there are three black Krishnas that mediate between the red and the
white; that both Krishna and Siva, though ostensibly absent from or passive at the disrobing of Draupadi and the
disastrous dice game, are in fact essential elements of these episodes; and many more. Several chapters deal at
length, and in

great detail, with the death of the hero, the destruction of the world, and other aspects of the tragedy at the heart of
the Epic. These are analyzed in the light of many complementary theories gleaned from an impressive array of
scholarly works cited in the copious footnotes. But this is no patchwork of other peoples' theories; it is an
integrated and highly original view of Krishna and and of the great Epic as a whole.
To begin with, Hiltebeitel is one of Georges Dumézil's greatest supporters, who paid his homage to the master by
translating a number of Dumézil's works into English. One great strength of this book is the skill with which the
author places the Krishna epic in the context of other Indo-European epics that Dumézil has elucidated, particularly
the Scandanavian and Greek epics. Many of Dumézil's ideas are put to new tests here. Some of them prove, in
Hiltebeitel's hands, to be even more exciting than when they were first boldly suggested by Dumézil. Some are
right but not particularly illuminating. Some of them prove to be dead wrong.

For Hiltebeitel challenges Dumézil on many important points. Thus, where Dumézil (and J. A. B. van Buitenen)
regarded the story of the Pandavas' divine heritage as a late addition, with even later Saiva retouchings, Hiltebeitel
suggests that an old tradition may have been preserved and linked with Siva, and he argues that the activities of
Visnu and Siva were integral to the work from an early period of its construction (p. 174). Unlike Dumézil, he
views the mythological paternities of the heroes as an integral part of the Epic. Following the lead suggested by
Dahlmann at the turn of the century, that the myths are not "interpolations," Hiltebeitel builds upon Angelo
Brelich's formulation and argues that the Epic integrates myths, which tell how gods create fate, with legends,
which tell how heroes challenge fate. The didactic elements, too, and the whole consideration of sin and virtue, are
correctly regarded as part and parcel of the epic narrative.
But Hiltebeitel is also an admirer of Madeleine Biardeau, who is critical of the Critical Edition that Dumézil and
van Buitenen endorse, an edition that has selected what appears

to be the oldest layer of the major epic, called it "the Mahabharata *," and relegated all other variants to
appendices. Thus, like Biardeau and unlike Dumézil, Hiltebeitel consistently draws upon material that is rejected by
the critical edition, using what the critical edition labels "interpolations" to develop his persuasive ideas about such
matters as the scene in which Draupadi, distressed by the efforts to disrobe her, calls upon Krishna to rescue her
and he appears (p. 88); the importance of the jeu truqúe in Indo-European eschatology in general and the death of
Abhimanyu in particular (343 n.); and the reference to the warrior Salya as an incarnate demon (p. 91) and to the
Madraka as "dirt" (p. 277). He remarks that an essential variant of the myth of Visnu as the dwarf is provided by
"what must be regarded as one of the earliest tellings of the myth even though it occurs only in the Northern
recension of the Mahabharata*" (p. 137). Yet, though Hiltebeitel follows Biardeau in many of her interpretations,
he does not follow her slavishly. Thus, in discussing a possible interpolation that would make

Draupadi an incarnation of Saci, the wife of Indra, rather than of Sri, goddess of fortune, he notes that "Biardeau
seems to want it both ways...This solves little" (p. 145 n.).
The combination of the Dumézilian and the Biardeauvian approaches makes this book both exciting and sensible.
Hiltebeitel feels that "the apparent irreconcilability of the two approaches is only superficial, for both [Dumézil and
Biardeau ] draw on sources which can often be elucidated by a common frame of reference the practical and
conceptual mileau of the Brahamanas" (p. 15). He succeeds in combining the Indo-European perspective of
Dumézil with what he calls the Puranic or Hindu perspective of Biardeau, blessing this French marriage by citing
the old Sankhya simile of the blind man and the lame man (p. 140). He manages to walk the razor's edge between
the two camps, taking a lead gratefully from each when the lead is good, challenging or correcting a hypothesis
when he finds good grounds to do so, and refraining from clapping his hands in Oedipal triumph when he points
out a flaw in the master. Where Biardeau tends to be vague,

Page 18
Hiltebeitel is specific; where Dumézil is Procrustean, Hiltebeitel reshapes the theoretical bed on which the data are
to lie.
Thus, for example, he combines what he gleans from Biardeau's study of the motif of the Hindu doomsday with
what he gleans from Dumézil's work on the Scandanavian myth of the Ragnarok, pointing out weaknesses in both
approaches, non-correspondences between the Mahabharata * material on the one hand and the Scandanavian or
Puranic material on the other. He himself argues that there was an Indo-European epic crisis of "eschatological
proportions," an end to the age of heroes, which was correlated with a mythic crisis concerning the end of the
world. Here, as elsewhere, he sees a correlation rather than a transposition, a parallel development rather than a
layering. The tragic human holocaust is thus clearly, and in many strikingly detailed ways, correlated with the great
holocaust of the universe.
There is another important ancestor in Hiltebeitel's intellectual lineage, an ancestor whose work he has, again,

both followed and carried forward. J. A. B. van Buitenen taught Hiltebeitel his Sanskrit at the University of
Chicago and taught him much about the Epic, as Hiltebeitel acknowledges. Thus, building upon van Buitenen's
suggestion that the dice game in the second book of the Mahabharata * is part of a ritual of royal consecration,
Hiltebeitel points out the important role of the god Siva not only in this game but in other sacrifices that go out of
control (the brutal night raid in the Sauptikaparvan and the myth of Siva's destruction of Daksa's sacrifice). This
connection between different manifestations of "the ritual of battle" has proved to be one of the most insightful
and influential ideas in recent Indology. Yet Hiltebeitel, rightly, in my opinion, disagrees with van Buitenen both
when van Buitenen disagrees with Dumézil (about the importance of the mythological level of the Epic, which van
Buitenen dismissed and Dumézil and Hiltebeitel defended) and when van Buitenen disagrees with Biardeau (on the
subject of the critical edition, which van Buitenen supported and indeed translated, but Biardeau and Hiltebeitel
criticized).

Two other important Chicago influences were Victor Turner and Mircea Eliade. Indeed, if Biardeau and Dumézil
supplied the sacred-royal function, and van Buitenen the martial (or what he would have called the baronial)
function, it may be that Victor Turner and Mircea Eliade supplied the fertile function. Turner not only published
the original edition of this book in his series, "Symbol, Myth, and Ritual," but taught Hiltebeitel a lot about the
ritual aspects of the Epic. In his fascinating discussion of the color symbolism of the four Ages and the four social
classes, the three strands of matter and three Krishnas, Hiltebeitel cites to great advantage Victor Turner's
suggestion that, on a more universal level, white is associated with milk, semen and life; red with blood, childbirth
(life) and bloodshed (death); and black with cessation of consciousness ("blackout") and death. In this way he
carries the argument beyond the Indo-European framework and into the world of true comparativism. For, when
the chips are down, Hiltebeitel is a historian of religions. Once, he told me, when he and Victor Turner were
talking together, Hiltebeitel

admitted that he was still an Eliadean at heart, and Turner replied, "So am I." This comparative stance leads
Hiltebeitel to formulate correlations (what the Vedic poets called bandhus) that, however much they may be
grounded in Indo-European or even Indian data, are more broadly applicable to the true hero of this book, who is
not Krishna but Eliade's homo religiosus.

Chapter 1
Traditional Epics
Epic stories have never suffered from lack of attention, but all too often they have been viewed as extensions of
something else: most commonly of myth, ritual, or history.1 Granting that epic stories have almost always drawn
something from these three areas, I hope to show that epic is best regarded as a unique category.
Nevertheless, the "myth and epic" approach has been fruitful in studying the Mahabharata *, since it has settled
two points. First, the leading heroes of the epic, the five sons of Pandu* and their wife Draupadi*, "transpose" into
human or heroic terms a mythic, apparently Indo-European, theologem. The oldest son representing sovereignty
and moral virtue as they are connected with what Georges Dumézil has called the Indo-European first function, is
Yudhisthira*, the son of Dharma (the latter plausibly a substitute for the Vedic god Mitra). Representing the brutal
and chivalric sides of the second, warrior, function are Bhima* and Arjuna, sons of Vayu* and Indra. Representing
the third function are the twins, Nakula and

1959), pp. 34-48; idem, Myth and Reality (New York: Harper & Row, 1963), p. 199. For reflections on
such assumptions in critical studies of Germanic legends, see Georges Dumézil, From Myth to Fiction: The
Saga of Hadingus, Derek Coleman, trans. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973), pp. 15 and 26. On
the evolutionary order ritual-myth-epic, see Gertrude Levy, The Sword from the Rock: An Investigation into
the Origins of Epic Literature and the Development of the Hero (London: Faber and Faber, 1953).

Sahadeva, sons of the twin Asvins *, who show, like their divine parents, a capacity for service, beauty, healing,
and a connection with cattle and horses. Complementing them all is their wife-in-common Draupadi*, incarnation
of Sri*. Following the seminal work of Stig Wikander,2 Dumézil and Madeleine Biardeau have both continued to
use this type of analysis and have filled the dossier of meaningful transpositions so as to include almost every
major figure in the poem.3 Second, with more controversy and with each of the three scholars pointing in a
different direction, there is still agreement that the great Mahabharata* war, taking place at the end of the
Dvapara* yuga and the beginning of the Kali yuga, isat least in partthe epic reflection of a mythic eschatological
crisis.4
The search for mythic foundations has also led Dumézil and Wikander to insights concerning the manner by which
other Indo-European peoples have shaped their epic material. Not all is by "transposition": the euhemerized
Scandinavian and Welsh stories, in which gods retain their names but are given human status; the Scandinavian,
Roman, and Iranian "histories of origins" in which successions of kings are arranged to reflect the order of the
functions; the Roman histories in which the trifunctional gods interact with various heroes, but without an
expressed mythology. All of these cases present their own peculiar problems, but the prevailing assumption, the
tool by which these discoveries have in fact been made, retains its value. Epic, legend, pseudohistory, and "roman"
are all better

understood through an appreciation of their mythic backgrounds.5
I do not wish to take issue with the results, or even the methods, of such a successful, stimulating, and scrupulously
carried-out enterprise. However, as a means of interpreting epic, the underlying assumption can lead to excesses
and over-simplifications. Such I fear are what we find in two efforts to discover mythic foundations for the Iliad.6
But this point is not crucial. One cannot fault a method because some have overextended its use or followed it
uncritically, yet I think there is a lesson here. The assumption that myth has an inherent priority over epic has led
scholars, discontent with epic tales as tales in themselves, to manufacture mythic patterns and prototypes for them.
One result is that the epic story is ultimately robbed of autonomy. Taken to the extreme, epic becomes, in essence,
a replica of myth.
In order to move beyond this impasse, it seems we must work toward a definition of the relationship between myth
and epic. First I must admitor better, insistthat my own usage is tailored to meet the requirements and the
character, which are in some respects peculiar or exceptional, of the Mahabharata *. The generalizations that
follow will thus proceed from this base, and there is no denying that the relationships between other epic and
mythic traditions might suggest, and indeed

have inspired, other approaches. I do not, of course, suggest that the Mahabharata * is to be viewed as the norm of
epic.
We must assume that the various Indo-European epic and mythic traditions survive, in their written form, as
casualties: segmented, fragmented, or uprooted from the cultures which produced them. The final redactors of such
epic traditions as are found in the Shah-nama*, the Mabinogion, the Tain* Bó Cuailnge, and in Saxo Grammaticus'
account of the Battle of Brávellir conserve epic material that is no longer enriched in the authors' own minds by
any contact with a living mythology. On the other hand, the various euhemerizers who conserve mythic traditions
under the guise, or within the dimensions of, "history," are obviously prevented (even if the material in their hands
retains a mythic structure7) from allowing their humanized gods any significant interplay with the mythic beings
they once were. Only in a few cases is there a sustained interaction between the figures of myth and epic: for
instance, in Rome, Greece, and India. In each of the first two cases, the mythology to which the heroic traditions
allude has in one way or another been denatured. In Rome the primal kings of the "history of origins" interact
frequently with the trifunctional divinities through prayers, omens, blessings, and punishments. But as Dumézil has
emphasized, these gods are essentially without mythology, there being no divine adventures with which to compare
those of the legendary kings. And in Greece, although Homer's Olympians interfere constantly in the affairs of the
heroes, they appear essentially as "symbolic predicates of action, character, and circumstance"8 whose adventures
"are not myths in any strict sense, but literary inventions that have something in common with the ingenious

elaborations of Euripides."9 Only in India, then, are the epic poets not only fully aware of, but deeply involved in,
a living mythology.
Such a continuum between myth and epic need not be regarded as totally peculiar, yet here terms have often been
used loosely. Epic, whatever its stylistic features and its origins as a narrative and poetic genre, should be
regarded, in terms of content, as falling under the heading of legend. And legend, with epic as a subcategory,
should be distinguished from myth. All this is made problematic by authors who have treated myth as an
imperialistic category.10 William Bascom has shown that the distinction between myth and legend has a long
scholarly history and is definitely applicable to the different types of narratives found in primitive societies.11 In
fact, one distinguishing feature, according to Bascom, is that while both myths and legends tell "true stories," they
do so with different time referents: the former evoking the remote past, the latter a more recent past.12 Moreover,
as M. L. West has shown in the "Prolegomena" to his edition of Hesiod's Theogony, continuums between
theogonic myth and heroic genealogies are also found in Hesiod, in Genesis, in the Bundahishn, the Puranas * and

Mahabharata *, the Kojiki and Nihongi, in Polynesian oral literature, and in the Kalevala.13 With such continuities
in mind, let me thus propose the following definitions, solely in terms of the contents of the two genres.
Myths are stories which take place in the fullest expanses of time and space (they articulate a cosmology); they
deal with the origin, nature, and destiny of the cosmos, and their most prominent characters are gods.
Legends are stories which take place at a specific time and on a specific terrain; they deal with the origin, nature,
and destiny of man, and their most prominent characters are heroes.
Each item in this pair of definitions is capable of refinement, and there will certainly be some overlap.14 But the
main purpose is to provide definitions which, while maintaining distinctions, allow important rapports between the
two genres to show through. With such distinctions in mind, and with epic seen under the larger heading of heroic
legend, an epic morphology can be discerned. One should not confuse this subject with the "heroic morphology" of
Angelo Brelich,15 whose research points out a direction in which future Mahabharata* research might well
evolve. Brelich tries to show the complex of associations, from both legend and cult, which the Greek heroes have
with certain particular themes: death, combat, athletic contests, prophesy, healing, mysteries, oracles, founding
cities, the initiation of young adults, and the founding of clan groups. While I shall often draw on Brelich's
beautiful
13 M. L. West, ed., Hesiod. Theogony (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966), pp. 1-16.
14 Certainly these definitions allow "myths" about men (the Crucifixion of Jesus, the Buddha's Birth and
Enlightenment), and hardly imply that gods do not make appearances in legends or epics. Also, I seek to avoid
identifying myths solely with the past; obviously, eschatologies deal with the future.

work, it is my intention to concentrate directly on a complex of various features within epics and heroic traditions
themselves, rather than on the relations between such traditions and matters of cult. While the themes are not
necessarily all unique to epic, together they constitute a complex whose outlines become easily intelligible once the
place of epic is recognized in a continuum with myth. My hope here is to be suggestive rather than exhaustive, to
set the exploration of the Mahabharata * in a comparative framework.
Fate
Brelich points to the way myth and legend, and the two dimensions of time which they present, are often related.
Discussing the place of "la struttura eroica" with the larger "col-lettività mitiche" of Greece, Brelich says that
whereas the activity on the mythic level concerns a past which involves the formation of the world and the
childhood, or in any case, the not-yet-fulfilled life of the gods, "the heroes have an analogous position, only with
respect to the formation of the human world."16 This analogy, this coincidence of planes, between the formation
and direction of the cosmos and the formation of the world of man, gives the lives of heroes their special gravity.
Their activities are weighted with a burden of recompense. Whereas the gods and goddesses play out their intrigues
in the fluid, formative, and free realm of myth, identical or similar intrigues, when acted out by heroes or heroines,
take shape in a different mold which, in fact, hardens into their destiny. The cosmic order which the gods (whether
polytheistic or monotheistic) create and sustain is nothing else for the hero than fate, sometimes happy, but usually
cruel and harsh. Indeed, in epics where such themes are already articulated, the relation between these two
forcescosmic order and human destinyis often a matter for great reflection. From

the heroes' standpoint, the forces may coincide, as with two of the Mahabharata's * words for fate: vidhi, "what is
ordained," and daivam, "what pertains to the gods."17 But fate is usually at least something with which the heroes
must come to terms, as can be seen from Helmer Ringgren's study of epic fatalism in the Shah-nama* and Cedric
Whitman's essay on "Fate, Time, and the Gods" in the Iliad.18
What is important, however, is not so much that certain epicsthe Greek, Persian, and Indian especiallyhave worked
out cleat formulations of fatalism, or that they reveal important correlations between the concepts of fate in the
epics and those that have been worked out elsewhere in those cultures, in other types of texts.19 What is significant
is that epics present a context in which the heroes, coming to terms with the origin, nature, and destiny of the
universe as it impinges upon them, inevitably make some type of responsesubmission, defiance, courage, faith,
self-discovery, stoicism, humility, vacillation, doubt, cowardicewhich takes on determinitive symbolic value in
terms of an understanding of the origin, nature, and destiny of man.
I thus suggest that the concept of epic fatalism can be extended beyond those heroic traditions in which a specific
philosophy of fate is worked out. In this respect, it would be more fruitful to compare the related themes in various
epics directly, rather than try to interpret the fatalism of the Shah-nama* and the Mahabharata*, for instance, as
common derivatives from an

anterior Indo-Iranian philosophy of fate.20 In this sense, the term "fate" would, of course, have to be used open-
endedly, implying that the heroes face the conditions that "determine" human existence, that "shape" human
destiny. Examples are not necessary here, except to say that one highly visible type, the hero who faces up bravely
to the conditions which will bring on his death, is responding to, or fulfilling, a personal fate, whether this be stated
explicitly, as with Achilles, Karna *, Siyavosh*, or Gilgamesh, or implicitly, as with Cüchulainn, the Christian
martyrs, or the Australian heroes of the dreamtime. The lives and activities of heroes, then, imply a sort of
crystallization of fate. Mythic meaning has impinged into human life, and the hero defines himself by his response
to conditions which may never occur again, but are "true" for all time. For many heroes, their response of greatest
import is in the case of their deaths. We thus move from the abstract to the concrete.
Births, Deaths, Fatalities
The devices which link the divine and the heroic are highly informative symbols of the relationship between myth
and epic. Incarnations,21 possessions,22 and relations of favor or disfavor between particular divinities and
individuals23 all find their
20 Ringgren, Fatalism, pp. 40-47, is unconvincing on a genetic connection between Indian Kala-* and
Iranian Zurvan-speculation. He seems more credible when, noting the great number of terms for "time" in
the Shah-nama*, he says: "This must imply that the important thing is the conception of time, and that epic
fatalism is no mere reproduction of ancient Zervanism" (p. 47).
21 H. Munro Chadwick and Nora Kershaw Chadwick, The Growth of Literature, 3 vols. (Cambridge University
Press, 1932, 1936, 1940), II, 525, see no parallel (I think correctly) to the avatara* theme in Western heroic
literature, although several authors will speak of Cüchulainn as an "avatar" of Lug; cf. the incarnations in the

places, in various epics, as indexes to a hero's "true" identity. The most common device is that which links heroes
to gods by means of their births. As indicated at the beginning of this chapter, nowhere are the divine-human
origins of heroes and heroines more significant than in the Mahabharata *, but, as is well known, pairings between
mortal and godly parents also lie behind such illustrious names as Achilles, Aenias, Sarpedon, Helen, Heracles,
Cúchulainn, the "two-thirds divine" Gilgamesh, and the Tibetan Gesar. But when Homer and Hesiod describe the
heroes of Troy as "demigods" (Iliad 12 23; Works and Days 160), they refer to a conception that extends beyond
the immediate birth of every hero.24 In addition, the heroes' closeness of contact with the gods, their life in a time
when such contact was the norm rather than the near-impossible exception, a time when humans were greater than
they are now, gives the heroes a special intermediary position between gods and men for which their births may
serve as a primary symbol.
Such divine origins or affiliations, however, are never the "whole story." In and through the lives of the heroes,
these conditions, these divine rapports, vanish, and in contrast to the conditions under which their lives are begun,
their ends are marked by all-too-human themes.25 As Brelich remarks,26 very few of the Greek heroes die a
natural death, while an incalculable number are slain. Most of the heroes, we are told
24 See Chadwick and Chadwick, Growth of Literature, I, 13, who cite Jordanes' description of the "chiefs"
of the Goths as semideos; also Dumézil, Destiny of the Warrior, p. 117, noting that in the Rg* Veda the
hero Trasadasyu* is called ardhadevam*, "demigod."
25 This generalization might be refined by pointing out that where the link with the gods is by means other
than birthsuch as by a possession or by initiationthis still constitutes a "new beginning" or "birth" in the hero's
career. Heroes who die a "divine death"like certain "Odinic heroes"still do so as heroes and actually die, unlike
Odinn (whose death at the Ragnarok* is of a different order), in the corresponding conditions; see Dumézil,
Myth to Fiction, pp. 129-53.

by Hesiod, died in war at Thebes or Troy, others in single combat; some were slain through treachery, some by
near relatives; some were torn to pieces, some turned to animals, and some were destroyed by Zeus's thunderbolt;
some fell victim to certain types of incidents, such as snake bites or mishaps during chariot races, hunts, or training
exercises; and others committed suicide. One may certainly also recall here the two deaths most highlighted in the
Iliad: those of Patroklus and Hektor. Before Achilles slays Hektor, he says to him: "I only wish that my spirit and
fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw for the things that you have done to me" (22. 346-48).
Then, when Hektor is slain and all the Achaeans stab his body (22. 371), there follows the "shameful treatment"
(22. 395) by Achilles, who drags the corpse before the walls of Troy, then across the plain to the Achaeans' camp,
and there three times around the body of Patroklus (24. 16). As to the latter's death (16. 784-867), three times (as
Achilles' stand-in) Patroklus attacks the Trojans and kills nine each time, is then disabled by Apollo who strikes
him on the back, is speared by the Dardanian Euphorbos between the shoulders, and then again in the belly by
Hektor whom he tells, with his dying words: "You are only my third slayer" (16. 850). I do not know whether
scholars more familiar with Greece have pondered the meaning of these various symbolisms. The invitation is to
be found in some apt words of Victor Turner: "Since most epics are replete with combats, battles, wars and
assassinations, the killing scene is often an epitome or multivocal symbol of the scheme of values underpinning the
whole work."27
Although such matters will be taken up in subsequent chapters, let me mention here some general points. I will try
to show that the Mahabharata * has taken special pains to lend coherence to thematic material of this type. Certain
deaths follow

directly on others, and I believe the symbolisms are related. Second, the heroes' deaths often involve mythic themes
which, as the latter provide a background for "human" events, shape them into inevitable fatalities. The clearest
case is the death of Karna *: what is a mythologem on one level, a divine opposition between Indra and Surya*
which leads, in the mythology, to no more than the latter's loss of face and a gain for one of Indra's human
protégés, is, on the heroic level, an intrigue shaped by a preceptor's curse which predestines the hero, Surya's* son,
to his death at the hands of Arjuna, Indra's son. But whereas the mythic drama involves an opposition between the
gods of Storm and Suna drama which takes place at no particular time, or in a perennial seasonal time, and which
demands no final resolution in terms of the relationship between the two godsthe heroic drama takes place once and
for all and requires human motivation, a series of fatalities, to account for the hero's end.28
In later chapters I will discuss several cases where the causalities which bring on heroes' deaths have mythic
dimensions. But even where no related myth is known, the deaths of the epic heroes are charged with symbolism.
Almost always, and especially in the battle scenes, certain fatalities set up the conditions whereby a particular
death becomes possible: not only curses and blessings, but oaths or vows (the deaths of Dhrstadyumna*, Drona*,
Duhsasana*, Jayadratha, Duryodhana, and others) and personal prohibitions, whether dishonored (as with
Sisupala*, who dies when he commits one more than the hundred offenses permitted him) or honored (as with
Bhisma*, who falls because he refuses to fight anyone who was formerly a woman). It is as if the hero were
invulnerable to deaththat his closeness to the gods, whether by birth or by his activities,

would make him immortalwere it not for some intruding and apparently arbitrary human factor, or series of factors,
which, in his dealings and interactions with other heroes, has brought a nonetheless inevitable mortality upon him.
It would be instructive to examine the world's epics for the variety of forces which seal the fates of their heroes.
No doubt the Indian stress on the power of curses, blessings, and vows owes something to Hindu asceticism
(although parallels are easy to find elsewhere). But the device of the personal prohibition, which in Bhisma's * case
appears essentially as a negative vow, finds a close analogue in Ireland. There, a hero or heroine will have his or
her destiny shaped by a geis (plural gessa), a personal prohibition, which may set the conditions for a woman's
marriage (as with Medb of Cruachan, according to the Táin Bó Cuailnge29) or a man's death. Unlike Bhisma*,
who falls because he virtuously upholds his negative vow, Irish heroes often fall because their gessa are broken (as
with Conaire) or, more particularly, where they have been broken because one geis has conflicted with another (as
with Cúchulainn).30 In any case, such epic devices are no doubt as ancient as the myths in which we find parallel
dramas.31
Character and Psychology
The details of the hero's death and the fatalities that bring it on are telling strokes in the portrayal of his character.
But throughout a hero's life, compelling motivations are produced

Survival of Geis in Medieval Romance (Halle A. S: Max Niemeyer, 1933).
31 Comparisons of fatalities will also reveal devices peculiar to specific epic and heroic traditions, such as
prophesies, prayers, horoscopes, hecatombs, auguries, interpretations of omens, divinatory practices, games of
skill and chance.

by desires, demands, and conflicts which, together, constitute the basic texture of epic drama. Aristotle appreciated
long ago the importance of character in epic;32 W. P. Ker, in contrasting the stress on character in epic and the
emphasis on mood and sentiment in romance, picked up on Aristotle: "Without dramatic representation of the
characters, epic is mere history or romance; the variety and life of epic are to be found in the drama that springs up
at every encounter of the personages."33 This conception very properly leads beyond the single figure to the more
revealing depiction of the relationsconflicts and consolidaritiesamong characters.34 Indeed, if one admits at least
the general importance of character in epic, it should be possible to regard epic, and perhaps most heroic stories, as
primary vehicles for the expression of psychological values. It is certainly no accident that the "Oedipus complex,"
the "Electra complex," and, as Brelich would have it, the "Iphiclus complex,"35 all take their names from Greek
heroes. Psychological disequilibrium seems to be a fundamental given of epic conflict and drama.
In this connection, certain problems arise with a point made by Dumézil, who seems to let the ease with which he
finds
32Poetics 1460. a. 5: "Homer is the only poet who knows the right proportions of epic narrative; when to
narrate, and when to let the characters speak for themselves. Other poets for the most part tell their story
straight on, with scanty passages of drama and far between. Homer, with little prelude, leaves the stage to
his personages, men and women, all with characters of their own."
33 William Paton Ker, Epic and Romance: Essays on Medieval Literature (2d rev. ed., 1908; repr. New York:
Dover, 1957), p. 17.
34 This point is made partly to delimit the value which I attach, at least as regards epic research, to certain
studies which deal with only one type of hero and his "monomyth," especially what I would call the composite
"Oedipal Bodhisattva" of Joseph Campbell in his The Hero with a Thousand Faces (New York: Meridian,
1957).
35 Brelich, Gli Eroi Greci, p. 243, n. 52, suggests that if Freud had known the Iphiclus legend, he would have
used this term for the "castration complex"; see Apollodorus, The Library 1. ix. 12: as a child, Iphiclus ran
away when his father laid beside him the bloody knife he had been using to geld rams; later, he had to be cured
of impotence.

trifunctional and other mythical themes transposed into the Mahabharata * suggest a misleading contrast with the
Iliad, where such patterns are harder to come by. According to him, in the Mahabharata* (and also in other non-
Greek Indo-European epic and legendary traditions), "the personages, entirely defined by their function, present
scarcely anything of psychological interest. Yudhisthira*, Bhima*, Arjuna, Dhrtarastra*, Bhisma* are all of one
piece, and one can readily predict what each of them will do in each new circumstance." In contrast to the many-
sided and open-ended character of Achilles, free of mythic prototypes, Dumézil sees Karna* simply as the "son
and copy of the Sun, of the enemy of Indra, ... [who] can only confirm to his mother his inflexible resolution to kill
Arjuna, Indra's son, or die by his hand." And he adds: "In brief, Greece has chosen, as always, the better part: to
settled reflections, to the preestablished relations between men and things which she inherited from her ancestors
of the North, she preferred the risks and chances of criticism and observation."36
This is a surprising paean to the West. Granting that Homer's psychological characterizations are largely free of
pre-established mythological patterns (though hardly free of divine promptings) and have a critical and objective
quality, this does not mean that other modes of epic characterization lack psychological interest. The depiction of
Arjuna, the "warrior yogin,"37 provides the basis for as complex a psychology as one could wish. But even where
there are mythic models, the epic continuations (I avoid here the mechanical tone of terms like "copy" and
"transposition") can be of the greatest psychological subtlety. Things occur differently on the two different planes,
and that is the valueand for the Mahabharata* the purposeof having both. It is perhaps presumptuous, and probably
impossible, to analyze the psyches, the motivations,

the inner struggles of the gods; from the human point of view, there is something whimsically pure about their
actions. But when the themes of myth are viewed in terms of the lives, fates, and deaths of heroes, they can be
examined with great psychological depth. Thus the motivations of almost every major figure in the Mahabharata
*except Krishna, who plays his hand mysteriouslyare constantly under review. In the example already cited several
times, Karna's* inner struggles are actually of the highest interest: rich in loyalty, pride, courage, stubbornness,
determination, and especially resentment, obvious but never overstated. Moreover, some of the Mahabharata's*
most intriguing characterizations emerge directly from a juxtaposition of mythic and epic themes. One thinks of
Arjuna, the son of Indra who is reluctant to fight, and of certain other mythic-epic correlations handled with
restrained but unmistakable irony.38 As for Krishna, although his mind can never be read, his involvement is often
the foil by which the thoughts and true dispositions of others are bared. In the Udyogaparvan especially, his
alleged peace mission is the catalyst by which all the various conflicting claims and desires are brought into the
open, and thus into inevitable opposition.
One is thus compelled to think of different devices and different "epic psychologies" for different cultures. As to
the Mahabharata*, one need only look to Irawati Karve's delightful and provocative Yuganta and to Vishnu S.

the epic in terms of a specifically Hindu psychology which, so long as he checks his impulse to fabricate new
"complexes" à la Freud,40 has much to teach us. Not unassimilable to my depiction of Krishna as a foil,
Sukthankar's psychology is based on the recognition of Krishna as the "Inner Self" (Paramatman *) and Arjuna,
the warrior yogi, as the incarnate soul (Fivatman*). From this foundation, says Sukthankar: "If you pursue steadily
the indications offered by the symbolism underlying the lineaments of Arjuna and Sri* Krishna and dive yet deeper
into the plot of this great drama, you will discern as though in a dim twilight unmistakable traces of an exhaustive
but carefully veiled allegory underlying the whole narrative, a very delicate tracery of thought reflected, as it were,
in the subconscious of the poets and finding an elusive expressionnow refined and subtle, now clumsy and, to us,
grotesquein the characterization of most of the dramatis personae as well as in the delineation of many of the
scenes."41 Preferring to see a mythic background for specific character traits rather than a subconscious allegorical
patterning of various components of the psychelike the empirical ego ( = Dhrtarastra*), the buddhi ( = Vidura),
and various desires ( = the Kauravas)42I would nonetheless agree with Sukthankar's starting point, Krishna, and his
conception of the sweep of an "epic psychology." After all, such a psychology becomes intelligible in a religious
tradition which places such regular emphasis on the belief that the divine is found in every man, the center to
which all else relates. One would hardly expect a psychology like this from Homer. It is one, nonetheless.

Sins and Virtues
Contrary to popular assumptions, the epic hero is rarely a uniformly ideal figure. Peter Hagin says of eighteenth-
century English efforts to create epics around idealized noble statesmen: "The numberless qualities of the neo-
classical hero only conceal his narrative weakness."43 Rama *, one of the few heroes to approach a standard of
complete perfection, appears idealized.44 When we find complex character and subtle psychology, however, we
may expect characterization in depth. And in most cases, epic heroeseven the most honored and the most
despisedare depicted ambivalently. Thus, when two of the Iliad's most noble heroes, Aenias and Achilles, meet
each other in combat, Aenias can say: "There are harsh things enough that could be spoken against us both, a ship
of a hundred locks could not carry the burden" (20. 246-47). Similarly, Reuben Levy has remarked that the
"lapses" of the heroes of the Shah-nama* are no less evident than the nobler side of its villains.45 Such
ambiguitywickedness among heroes, goodness among their foeshas misled some scholars, expecting heroic
perfection, to propose the so-called "inversion theory" of the Mahabharata*: that the "bad" side must originally
have been the good and the "good" side the bad.
One of the most stimulating treatments of this darker side of the hero is that of Brelich. The Greek heroes, he says,

monly present two types of characteristics: "physical monstrosities" and "moral imperfections." The list of the
former46 is one which might be instructively compared with unusual physiological traits found elsewhere. Indian
heroes of all sorts are described by their laksanas * ("marks"),47 one trait in particular having been compared to
the famous riastrad ("distortion") or delba ("forms") that affect Cúchulainn; and one may also think of the lus-
nan* ("bad body") of Gesar.48 Brelich, in fact, thinks that physical and moral abnormalities are intimately
connected, sharing a "common denominator" of "monstrosity"; and he suggests that his proposed distinction may
actually be culturally conditioned, imposed on the heroes through the more recent perspectives of Greek
rationalism and Christianity.49 Although I will not follow this lead, it is certainly true that physical and moral
defects may complement each
46 See Brelich, Gli Eroi Greci, pp. 233-48; giganticness and dwarfishness, theriomorphism, traces of
androgyny, physical deformities of teeth (cf. Harald Hyldetan), of inner organs, humpbacks, headlessness,
many-headedness, defects of legs and feet (wounds and lameness: see Claude Lévi-Strauss' treatment of
this feature of the Oedipus cycle: Structural Anthropology [Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1967], pp. 210-
13) and the eyes. One notes the apparent absence of the theme of arm loss which is so prominent in
Roman, Irish, Scandinavian, and Indian (Bhurisravas*, Bhima's* son Sutasoma, Savitr*) myths and
legends.
47 India's most famous case is the thirty-two major laksanas* of the Buddha; see Eugene Burnouf, Le Lotus de

intriguing list of heroic marks (sura* ... laksanani*; 6). In this vein, Dumézil, Destiny of the Warrior, pp. 161-
64, discusses the strange but similar grimacesone eye raised, the other lowered, or, as with Arjuna, high
cheekbonesof Cúchulainn, the Viking Egill (on these two, see also de Vries, Heroic Song, pp. 82-85), and
Arjuna. Indeed, Mbh. 12:102, 14 tells us that the brave are those of "crooked [or squinty] eyes, prominent
foreheads, and fleshless jaws [or cheekbones]" (jihmaksah* pralalatasca* nirmamsahanavo*)!

other, as, for instance, with the doubly blind Dhrtarastra * and perhaps the pale and "impotent" Pandu*.50
As this suggests, the sins of a hero, or of a group of heroes, may sometimes form a significant symbolic structure;
but material of this kind is not always systematized into coherent patterns. For instance, I would not superimpose
the scheme of the "three sins of the warrior"which I shall discuss later on the single episode in which Achilles,
insulted, resolves not to fight.51 Yet there is no doubt that his behavior in generalhis wrath and hubrisis ambiguous
and far less than "ideal." Such incidents, however, invariably provide important indexes to key cultural and
religious valueswhether they are systematized or not. Brelich has called attention to certain "moral imperfections"
among the Greek heroes that find interesting analogues in the Indian heroic tradition: excessive violence and
sexuality, incest, untruthfulness, deception, and insolence.52 Equally important for comparative purposes, he
observes faults that find few if any analogues in the Indian epos: hubris itself ("pride" is a common moral defect in
the Mahabharata*, but it never has as much play, and certainly not the same connotations, as in Greece53), and
also madness, patricide,
50 On these traits, see, for both Pandu* and Dhrtarastra*, Dumézil, ME, I, 151-52, 155-57, 162-74, and, for
Pandu*, idem, FMQ IV, 76-80.
Regarding Brelich's thesis, it seems to me that the two types of "monstrositres" point in different directions:
the physical defining the hero as materia prima, an emergence into human form of a mythic identity; the
moral defining the hero not in relation to myth (or some inherent natural disposition) but to the structures of
human society. Although such a formulation requires further thought, one may think of Sisupala*, whose
physical abnormalities at birth (three eyes, four arms) define him in relation to Siva*, but whose sins
correspond to the three social functions; see Dumézil, ME, II, 59-68.
51 See Littleton, "Indo-European Themes in the Iliad," p. 238, and see my article, "Dumézil and Indian
Studies," JAS, XXXIV (1974), 133-34.
52 Brelich, Gli Eroi Greci, pp. 248-65.
53 For the most part, pride (darpa, abhimana*) seems in the Mahabharata* to be a fault confined to
Duryodhana and to others whose pretensions to specifically royal prerogatives must occasionally be smashed:
see, for example, Indra's pride, 1:189, 17 (discussed in Chapter 7) and that of Yayati* (discussed in Dumézil,
ME, II, 274).

and outright robbery.54 However, as with its strange deaths, the Mahabharata * has correlated and systematized
much of this ethical content into coherent frameworks, ones which I hope to make clear. In fact, the sins and
deaths are in some instances intimately connected and form the nucleus of a complex and extensive fabric of
symbols.
I would like once again to suggest that such material is more naturally "heroic" than "mythic." To be sure, there can
be divine sins and follies, some of the same sorts as are committed by heroes: adulteries, incests, deceptions,
sometimes even murders. And some sins are more clearly limited to heroes, such as sacrilege and impiety (only in
India could Indra, a god, commit a sacrilege by killing a brahmin). But the main point is that only among heroes, as
essentially human figures, can the full implications of violations and misdeeds be worked out and understood as
sins. When Loki instigates the murder of Baldr, when Zeus indulges his sexual appetite, even when Indra commits
his assorted crimes, these are pure deeds. They invite no moral investigation. The gods act out of their own
essential natures, and that is that. But when a hero sins, whether the sin be implicit or explicit, one finds a
dilemma, a matter of choice, which gives his act its special finality and tragedy and which leaves it open to
investigation from every angle. It is perhaps from such considerations as these that the Mahabharata* supports our
point with the following words: "Virtue and sin exist, O king, only among men; these do not exist among creatures
other than men" (manusesu* maharaja* dharmadharmau* / na tathanyesu* bhutesu* manusyarahitesviha*;
12:238, 28).
This quote makes my next point sufficiently obvious. Some correlation may be expected between epic sins and epic
virtues, and the Mahabharata*, clearly systematizing once again, will not disappoint us, nor is it alone. The
Chadwicks have said: "Statements of social standards are expressed in the Mahabharata* far
54 Brelich, Gli Eroi Greci, pp. 248-65, 295-96. As far as I can see, Indian epic knows extremely erratic
ascetics and stressful situations, but nothing like madness, whether feigned or real.

more frequently than in Western heroic poetry," a fact they attribute "in the main to the very large didactic
accretions." But when they discuss the Western epics, they make it very clear that such material is there, too:
sometimes explicitly, as in Beowulf, sometimes thematically important but not made the subject of discussion, as in
the Norse, Irish, and Homeric stories. For the Chadwicks, of course, the cardinal virtues are those of the heroic age,
and thus quite uniform: courage, loyalty, generosity. Moreover, the vices are these virtues' anti-theses: cowardice,
disloyalty, and meanness, plus others like avarice, arrogance, violence toward one's own household, and a
disregard for oaths.55 The virtues here are less interesting than the vices, for such "unheroic" qualities as wisdom
and cleverness, which one finds in the Iliad, not to mention some of the stranger virtues which occur in the
Mahabharata *, are left out of the Chadwicks' enumeration. Yet one step toward understanding the moral
imperfections of epic heroes will be to investigate the ideals of moral perfection which they also embody, albeit
inadequately, imperfectly, incompletely.
The Heroic Age
These various morphological features of epic come together in the heroic age. The idea of a "heroic age" was
adopted by H. M. and N. K. Chadwick, and used before them by W. P. Ker and after them by Cecil Maurice Bowra
and others, to refer to what they all regarded as the historic situation in which epic heroes lived and in which their
peculiar life style was possible.56 According especially to the Chadwicks and Bowra, the historical core of epic
could invariably be uncovered by paring away the apparatus of nonhistorical and above all

"mythic elements," which would either reflect later accretions or "the beliefs of an uncritical age,"57 that is, the
heroic age itself. This procedure of taking epics primarily as repositories of historical events and social conditions
has led to some interesting conclusions and comparisons, most notably those in the groundbreaking work of Ker,
whose main contribution lies in the contrast he draws between epic and romance and the corresponding "heroic"
and "chivalric" ages which they portray.58 But though epic tales probably always reflect some actual past
conditions in one way or another, even the Chad-wicks realized that one must usually look outside the epics,
wherever possible to concurrent sources, for criteria to determine what was historical and what was not. In many of
the Germanic traditions they could, of course, demonstrate how historical personages had sometimes been worked
into heroic poems, often anachronistically.59 But since concurrent documents are usually wanting, and since epics,
on their own, present no inner criteria for historicity, and in fact usually have distorted whatever history one might
find in them, such efforts at reconstruction were, and still are, all too often guided by a pleasing but wholly
unreliable combination of common sense and wishful thinking. Both the Mahabharata *60 and the Ramavana*61
have been subjected to such an approach. Historical solutions to the peculiarities each epic presents are simply
imagined, such as the hypothetical tribal practices and traits which
57 Chadwick, Heroic Age, p. 130; cf. Chadwick and Chadwick, Growth of Literature, I, 198ff.; Bowra,
Meaning of a Heroic Age, pp. 3-5, says that historicity may be assumed even where it is unknown and
refers to mythic features like divine births as "incidental and almost irrelevant."

are supposed to lie behind the polyandric marriage of Draupadi * and the alliance of Rama* with the monkeys.62
Apparently it is impossible to view the "heroic milieu" of some epics as an historical record, for epics seem to play
havoc with history63if, indeed, they do not create it. The degree of distortions will have something to do with what
Victor Turner has called the "epic relation," which he defines as a relation between two periods of time: "(1) the
'heroic time' of the narrated events, with its implicit background of 'heroic' society; (2) the 'narrative time' when the
epic was first composed or believed to have been composed; (3) the 'documentary time' which covers the peiod for
which we have manuscripts of the epic in their various recensions (revision)."64 Turner has formulated this
schema because he disagrees with Ker that epic poetry is a "direct reflection" (the term is Turner's) of the heroic
age. As he says, "Much of the tension and mystery of epic derives from the ambivalence of the poet to the past."
But even though Turner speaks of the past as "imagined," and as a combination of the "fanciful and factual," he is
still inclined to see the poet's tension, however creative, as one which con-confronts two periods of history:
It may well be also that the derivation of epic's values, ethical imperatives and manners from several
dissonant epochs may be the very cause of its well-known universal-human quality. The poet is forced by
his materials away from the familiar paths of systematically connected customs and norms to make original
assessments of character and individual worth. He is at a sufficient distance from the

standards of the heroic age to be objective about them and even daringly to judge those standards
themselves by their good or bad effects on the fully human beings the multidimensional quality of his
material has allowed to emerge.65
I have no argument with the idea that this attitude of the poet toward the past will involve a reflection on some
facts of history, some ancient standards, combined with efforts of "creative imagination.66 But in his allegiance to
the view that the "heroic age" is primarily a category of history, perhaps Turner has not gone far enough.
It is perhaps best to begin with the classical source of this theme in Hesiod's Works and Days. After the hubris-
ridden heroes of the bronze age had destroyed each other by their own hands and departed anonomously for Hades,
Zeus "made yet another (generation), the fourth, upon the fruitful earth, which was nobler and more righteous, a
godlike race of hero-men who are called demigods, the race before our own, throughout the boundless earth" (156-
60).67 Like their immediate predecessors, many of the heroes died in battle, but unlike them, many were given a
place by Zeus "in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes" (171-72). It is
widely argued that Hesiod's age of heroes is intercalated between the ages of bronze and iron,68 and it is
sometimes argued that the basic myth of the four ages is
65 Turner, "Comparative Epic and Saga," pp. 15-17. Turner suggests additionally that frequently (Iran,
India, Ethiopia's Kebra Nagast) "major religious changes have occurred between heroic and narrative
times" (p. 14); cf. Bowra, Meaning of a Heroic Age, p. 19, speaking of intervening political changes.

originally oriental,69 or perhaps even Indo-European.70 We need not enter the discussions concerning source and
diffusion, but it is easy to imagine how an Indian Hesiod might have fashioned a five-yuga system by intercalating
a "heroic age" between the Dvapara * and Kali yugas, thus saving a special niche for the heroes of the
Mahabharata.*71 In such configurations, no matter how many ages are conceivedand one is reminded here of the
Irish device of the five invasions of the islandthe "age of heroes" stands out at a pivotal juncture between a past
that is essentially mythic and one that is purportedly historical. One thus meets a continuum between two ages, or
really threethe mythic, the heroic, and the "historical" so it is highly significant that the interactions between the
mythic and heroic realms are so basic to the fabric of epics.
Such connections establish the starting point for our discussion, for they determine the conditions which define the
heroes as heroes and thus permit the heroic age to begin. In this respect, the heroic age must be defined primarily,
in its inaugural conditions, as a category related to myth, not history; but it is more than roots and "beginnings," for
other features of heroic ages exhibit a mythic structure. Here I am indebted to Stig Wikander, one of whose
Haskell Lectures at the University of Chicago Divinity School in the fall of 1967 dealt with the question at hand.

his documentation, but I can reconstruct three of his points.
1. The idea found in Ker, the Chadwicks, Bowra, and others, that a "heroic age" is an essentially "magnificent and
aristocratic"72 feudal stage through which a society may pass (and then recall), is seriously tested by certain
features of such ages in different societies. First, no grounds, other than personal conviction, can be offered for
regarding the primary material of the Indian or Iranian73 (and also the Celtic) heroic ages as historical. Second,
Iceland's heroic age had no antecedent heroic society; heroic tradition was developed in peasant conditions. Some
societies recall two "heroic ages," like Ireland (with its Ossianic and Ulster cycles) and India (with its two epics).
And last, it is, I believe, misleading to overemphasize the "aristocratic" and "warrior" aspects of the heroic age.
Both the Chadwicks and Bowra speak of priests and magic as essentially alien to the heroic milieu.74 This view
ignores the close collaboration, or at least interaction, between warriors and such figures, in various epics, as
brahmins, druids, seers, poets, and wizards. Interactions between "classes" would seem, after Dumézil's research, to
be an archaic feature of Indo-European societies, which their epics reflect.
2. Within heroic ages there are almost always certain anomalies which either defy historical explanation or invite it
only at considerable peril. A list culled from a variety of sources yields anachronisms and temporal incongruities,
impossible time sequences (the fantastic life spans of such figures as the

74 See H. M. Chadwick, Heroic Age, pp. 440 and 459: a heroic age need require no more than "Mars and the
Muses." Bowra, Meaning of a Heroic Age, sees the heroic age as aristocratic and centered on war (p. 13), an
age which has freed itself from the magic and superstition which preceded it (p. 9) and which must take
opposition to the "priestcraft" of later times (pp. 9, 22-24) lest its story be "mangled" like the Mahabharata *
(p. 23).

Mahabharata's * Bhisma* and Vyasa*, the Shah-nama's* Zal, Rostam, and Afrasiyab*, the Celtic Fintan, the
Tibetan sPyi-dpon Khrargyan,75 and certain Old Testament figures), initiations, journeys, combats, trials, unusual
marriages (the case of Draupadi* hardly stands alone), special relations or identifications with animals (Rama's*
alliance with the monkeys is not unique), and then the various features already discussed: strange births and deaths,
physical and moral "monstrosities," and so on. The list is not exhaustive, nor is it meant to imply that any one of
these traits is to be found in every heroic age. Such features are hardly likely to record actual historic social
conditions or practices. One must perforce look elsewhere for an interpretation.
3. Often a peculiar and very striking structure is apparent in the way that heroic ages come to an end. First,
although Wikander did not mention this, the heroes usually receive some special reward: as Hesiod puts it, the
Greek heroes were given a place by Zeus in the "islands of the blessed." This destiny usually holds out the high,
and the sometimes impossible, hope for later mortals. But with their disappearance, there often come to an end the
clearly shaped (if impossible) chronology, the well-rounded narrative, and the delineated characterizations that
have attended their stories. In such cases we move from the heroic age to the "dark age," a time of flux and
uncertainties out of which the outlines of factual history gradually emerge in the inevitably dry form of genealogies
and chronicles, royal or otherwise. Victor Turner has nicely caught the tone of this transition as it is handled in the
two Greek epics: the Odyssey, he says, "might be compared to a long cooling-off ritual in which the heroic age
passes into the com-

monplace of mere history, through the tunnel, as it were, of a liminal legend, Odysseus' narrative of his
wanderings."76
As Wikander pointed out, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Persia, and India (and we might add Wales77) all have poor
historical traditions, but rich lore concerning their heroic ages. One cannot maintain that these heroic ages, and the
"dark ages" that follow them, are the result of diffusion. The datelines differ too markedly. Is one then to work
backward, relying on these skeletal histories when they claim some form of descent for men of later ages from the
heroes of old, as if the latter's "history" was preservedin each and every casewhile all else is vague and
rudimentary? Or is one to work in the other direction, starting from the assumption of a legendary heroic past in
which history, when and if it plays a role, conforms largely to mythic and heroic patterns, and to which later
generations would have traced their ascent artificially? The second alternative usually recommends itself. In fact,
the "dark age" must also be regarded as primarily a mythic construct, no less than the heroic age on which it relies.
Although in some traditions, like the Roman, the link between "heroic ages" and actual history is made rather
smoothly, usually it is not, even by some of the most "historically" oriented peoples in the world. There is
chronological confusion, after the clear "history" from the patriarchs down to Moses, in the books of Joshua and
Judges, out of which the dynastic history of Israel gradually emerges. Or one might think of H. G. Creel's
statement on the most celebrated and "heroic" dynasty of Confucian China: "For the first centuries of the Chou
dynasty we have no connected history. Even the orthodox Chinese histories give only scattered anecdotes and the
names and order of the kings, not attempting

a continuous narrative."78 The Christian age of martyrs and the Buddhist first age of the dharma both ended in
"darker" periods, preceding our own, when sainthood or arhatship become more and more difficult. In primitive
religions, where the question of historical documents does not come up, there is still an implicit temporal gulf
between the knowable present and the formative ages peopled by such heroes as the Australian totemic
ancestors,79 the heroes of American Indian legends,80 and the so-called Dema-Divinities of Ceram and New
Guinea whom Wikander, most tellingly, referred to as comparable to the heroes of the Mahabharata *.81 This is
not to say that historical material may not in some of these cases find a place in a heroic age, or that a dark age
may not correspond to an actual falling off from some earlier more "heroic" achievements. It does say that these
temporal sequences exhibit a cosmological structure that is primarily mythic, not historical, and that such sequences
are found not only in societies which have had heroic pasts of the type imagined by Ker and the Chadwicks, but in
societies whose heroes are totally unheroic by these scholars' standards.

the Dema, as they have the primary religious mythic and cultic role among the paleocultivators; but he notes
that they are of the type that has "often been called tribal or culture heroes." As to Wikander's comparison, my
recollection is that he was referring to the Demas' "creative deaths."

Moreover, they occur in societies with strong historical traditions (China, Tibet, Israel), weak historical traditions
(the Indo-European examples cited by Wikander), and "no" historical traditions (primitives, those without written
records). In other words, heroic ages and dark ages occur irrespective of history.
One may thus reasonably ask whether the ancient Indo-Europeans, before and during their migrations, had a
conception of a heroic age. Dumézil, in two of his most precise and illuminating studies, has shown that certain
types of epic figures, both heroes and heroines, can be traced, with their legends intact, to an Indo-European
source. Such is the legend of the monstrous birth, three sins, and final annihilation attached to the names of the
Scandinavian Starkadr (or Starcatherus), the Greek Heracles, and the Indian Sisupa1a *; and such is the case with
the Indian and Irish legends of the homonyms Madhavi* and Medb: their quadruple marriages, their dealings with
their royal fathers, and with other family matters of royal concern. Indeed, in both these cases Dumézil makes the
point that the stories are primarily heroic. In the first, the gods provide a discrete background drama of their own;
and in the secondeven in the Indian storythey barely interfere.82
Such illustrations of the tenacity and durability of legend,83 coupled with the insistence that myth and epic be
maintained as distinct categories in a potential continuum, might give the appearance that I am poised, with
Dumézil, to move beyond the comparison of individual legends to the larger question of a common Indo-European
epos. But at least up to now, Dumézil's interests and his operating assumptions have led him elsewhere. He has
been eager to reconstruct a comparative

company), and 361 (Madhavi* and company).
83 See Radin's remark, Winnebago Hero Cycles, p. 12, that "myths" (his term: "'sacred' folktales") are less
durable than legends because of the fluctuating use made of them in rituals.

Indo-European mythology, but the possibility of reconstructing Indo-European epic has only lately commanded his
attention. Referring to Stig Wikander as "pioneer once again,"84 he cites with tentative approval the latter's
explorations into this area: "A priori, the existence of Indo-European epic themes, or more generally of an Indo-
European literature, is likely [vraisemblable] The study which Wikander begins is thus full of promise."85
At this point, a few comparative studies, by Wikander and others, have shown that the Mahabharata's * story has
close ana1ogues in other Indo-European epic traditions. Its cousins include not only the main narrative segment of
the Persian Shah-nama*,86 but the Norse Battle of Brávellir recounted in the seventh and eighth books of Saxo
Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum.87 One cannot yet be certain how to interpret the points of contact between these
stories: common origin? similar story
84 Dumézil, ME, I, 255.
85 Dumézil has also pioneered in this area; see my review article, "Comparing Indo-European 'Epics,' "HRJ,
XV (1975), 90-100. See also the loose but informed list of parallels in S. Srikantaiya, "Asvatthaman," QJMS,
XXI (1931), 392-95, 401-2.

of Firdausi, Trübners Oriental Series, 7 vols. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, 1905-1912), IV, 129. In
both epics, one finds, in the same sequence, a leading "bad" hero (Duhsasana*, Piran*) having his blood drunk
(see only Wikander); the effort by the "bad" king (Duryodhana, Afrasiyab*) to hide in a lake after his army's
defeat (see Darmesteter and Wikander); and the ascent of the "good" king (Yudhisthira*, Key Khosrow) to
heaven, leaving his five loyal companions behind dead or about to die (see all three authors).

incidents through four generations, culminating in a war between the forces of a blind old king (Dhrtarastra*,
Haraldus Hyldetan) against his nephews which the latter cannot win until they eliminate a great champion
(Bhisma*, Ubbo Frescius) by filling his body full of arrows. Some of these points, and others too, will be
pursued and extended in Chapters 5, 11, and 13 below.

types from comparable heroic ages? parallel transpositions from a lost mythology? literary borrowings? My
preference for the first of these options will become clear.88 But one point is established: comparative research
shows that the Mahabharata * does not stand alone in the Indo-European continuum; rather, one finds stories
analogous to it in striking and cumulative details. Its story, at least in some of its basic contours and episodes, may
thus be very old. Indeed, it may be our best preserved "record" of the Indo-Europeans' heroic age.
88 So too Warner and Warner on the Indo-Iranian convergences and, seemingly, Dumézil on the Indo-
Scandinavian, although Wikander does not commit himself, ruling out only the second possibility.
Darmesteter, ruling out the third ("Points de contact," p. 49), takes the fourth option and argues that India
borrowed from Iran (pp. 51-57, 72); but Wikander shows that if it is a case of borrowing, the reverse would
be more likely ("Sur le fonds commun," pp. 311-12). An argument for borrowings has also claimed the
Mahabharata* as a source for the Aeneid: Madeleine Lallemand, "Une source de l'Éneide: Le
Mahabharata*," Latomus, XVIII (1959), 262-87. However, none of the features which may link these two
epics are the same as those which link the Mahabharata* with the others, thus leaving the argument that the
latter connections derive from a common epic heritage unaffected.

Chapter 2
Three Krsnas *: Variations on a Theme
Nearly all the great theories about the Mahabharata* have turned upon their authors' images of Krishna.1
Nevertheless, a curious set of facts has so far escaped mention in critical studies. The Mahabharata* knows not
just one Krishna; it knows three Krsnas*. The nomenclature is quite emphatic. First, there is the Krishna of our
title, often called by the patronymic Vasudeva*, son of the Vrsni* prince Vasudeva and his wife Devaki*.2 In this
chapter, as elsewhere, I shall refer to him, and him alone, by the spelling Krishna. Second, there is King Drupada's
daughter Draupadi*, Krsna*. (long "a" is the feminine ending) being her given name at birth because of her dark or
black color or complexion (krsnabhutsa* hi varnatah*; 1:155,50). Third, there is Vyasa*, his proper name also
being Krsna*, or more precisely Krsna* Dvaipayana*, "the Island-born Krsna*," since his mother Satyavati* (also
called Kali*, "Black") gave birth to him the very
1 I hope to write a separate article on the history of epic- and Krish-criticism. For the present, see Chapter
4 of my dissertation, Gods, Heroes, and Krsna*, pp. 133-90.
2 A Krsna* Devakiputra* appears in Chand*. Up. 3, 17,6 in conditions that neither support an identification
with nor a separation from the epic figure; for the most reasonable discussion, see S. K. De, "Vedic and Epic
Krsna*," IHQ XVIII (1942), 297-300. As to the patronymic Vasudeva*, many have assumed no "real"
Vasudeva lies behind it; there is too little to go on one way or the other; Krishna's father Vasudeva does,
however, appear in the epic and cannot be a Puranic* invention.

day of his conception on an island in the Yamuna * (1:54,2; 57,69-71).3 A fourth Krsna*, Arjuna, receives this
name only through his connection with Krishna Vasudeva* in instances where, recalling their mystical identity as
Nara-Narayana*,4 the dual case is used to refer to them as "the two Krsnas*" (krsnau*).5
As their roles in a number of incidents will show, the "three Krsnas*" have things in common. For instance, they
seem to cooperate in bringing about Draupadi's* foreordained marriage. Beyond this, all are incarnations of main
figures in the Vaisnava* "pantheon." Krishna and Vyasa* incarnate Visnu-Narayana* (the latter more particularly
Narayana* alone6), and
3 Gertain authors have discussed two of the three together: Christian Lassen, Indische Altertumskunde
(1847-1862; repr. 4 vols; Osnabruck: Otto Zeller, 1968), I, 790, on Draupadi* and Vasudeva*; Auguste
Barth, review of Joseph Dahlmann's Das Mahabharata* als Epos und Rechtsbuch, pt. 2, JS (1897), p. 327;
see also below, n. 6.
4 For further discussion of Arjuna and Krishna in this identity, see below, Chapter 10, at n. 23.
5 Concerning Arjuna, in two passages which describe the Pandavas'* com-plexions, Yudhisthira* and Bhima*
are said to be gaura ("white, fair, shining, golden") while Arjuna is svama* ("black, dark"): see 15:32,5 7 and
a Northern passage, Virataparvan*, 1136*, II. 1, 7, and 11. As to the "two Krishnas," S. Sorensen*, Index to
the Names in the Mahabharata* (1904; reprinted Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1963), p. 425, gives over thirty
citations.
6 For Vyasa* as an incarnation of Narayana*, see 12:334, 11: "Know Krsna* Dvaipayana* Vyasa* to be the
lord Narayana*" (krsnadvaipayanam* vyasam* viddhi narayanam* prabhum; var.: narayanam* bhuvi,
"Narayana* on earth"), and 12:337,4c: "born a portion of Narayana*" (narayanamsajam*). Madeleine
Biardeau, "Etudes de mythologie hindoue: Cosmogonies puraniques*," pt. 1 (hereinafter EMH, 1-3), BEFEO,
LIV (1968), 35, n. 1, remarks that Vyasa* is "a sort of doublet" of Vasudeva* in the epic, often repeating what
the latter says. But she makes no further comment other than to reject a derivation of Dvaipayana* from dvipad
or dvipada, which could make dvipa a synonym of Nara; see also EMH, 2, BEFEO, LV (1969), 82, n. 1, and
Edward Washburn Hopkins, Epic Mythology (1915; repr. New York: Biblo and Tannen, 1969), p. 216, n. 1, for
whom Vyasa's* link with Narayana* is "the last word of the Bhagavatas* and not early epic." Although true
that the identifications of Vyasa* come in the presumably late Narayaniya* section of the Santiparvan*, they
are probably based on the standard epic identification of Vyasa* as the "Island-born Krishna," an identity
linking him with Krishna, Draupadi*, and thus Visnu-Narayana* as well.

Draupadi * quite emphatically incarnates Visnu's* consort Sri*.7
One is tempted to seek some means by which to interpret this triple appearance of Krsnas*, for although they are
not explained by any single source or coinciding structure, their common designation is surely more than
fortuitous. Rather than any one interpretive framework, the "three Krsnas*" evoke several. Not surprisingly, the
common denominator in most of theseand I will discuss fourinvolves connotations of the name Krsna*: "Black."
Signs of the Times
Black is the color of the Kali yuga, the yuga which is about to come into being as the Mahabharata* battle brings
the preceding yuga to a close. According to Puranic* traditions, the beginning of the Kali yuga is marked, among
other things, by Krishna's death.8 More important, this is the closest one comes to an epic articulation of our
theme. One of the passages describing Vyasa's* relation to Narayana* seems to link two of the "three Krsnas*" to
the blackness of the Kali yuga. Asked about his emanation from Narayana*, Vyasa* tells that after Narayana* had
completed the "seventh creation" by emitting Brahma* from his navel (12:337,17), and after he had determined to
assume his various avatara* forms (337,32-36), he then, from a syllable of speech [bhoh*! 37; the sloka*
identifies this sound with Sarasvati*], gave birth to the rsi* Sarasvat, also called Apantaratamas*,9 and
commanded him to divide and arrange the Vedas (39). At the fulfillment of this command, Narayana* delegated
the rsi* to repeat this task at each Manvantara (41). Then, nar-
7 There is some controversy here, on which see below, Chapter 7; but the CE makes it clear that
Draupadi's* connection with Sri* is authentic and that an effort to connect her with Saci*, and Krishna's*
wife, Rukmini*, with Sri*, is an interpolation (see 1:61,5 and 566*).
8 See F. E. Pargiter, The Purana* Text of the Dynasties of the Kali Age (1913; repr. Benares: Chowkhamba
Sanskrit Series Office, 1962), p. x.
9 See Ganguli-Roy, Mahabharata, X, 616, n. 1: "The name 'Apantaratamas' implies 'one whose darkness or
ignorance has been dispelled."

rowing the time focus still further to a single Mahayuga *, Narayana* predicted that at the beginning of the Kali
yuga the rsi* would be the progenitor of "certain descendants of Bharata named Kurus, high-souled princes
celebrated on earth," among whom would erupt "a dissension in the family [kulabheda] having its end in their
mutual destruction, without you [tvamrte*].10... And when that dark yuga arrives, you will be of dark complexion"
(krsne* yuge ca samprapte* krsnavarno* bhavisyasi; 337,45-44). Narayana* added: "And you shall see me in the
world armed with a discus [that is as Krishna Vasudeva*]" (337,51).
From elsewhere, we know that black is Krishna's color for the Kali yuga alone, as he had assumed the colors white,
red, and yellow in the preceding yugas (sukla*, rakta, pita*, krsna*; 3:148,5-37; HV 2:71,31; but cf. Mbh.
3:187,31, reversing the middle pair). It is also reasonable to think of the blackness of the third Krsna*,
Draupadi*given her identity as an incarnation of Sri* and thus her mythological consolidarity with the other twoas
being similarly related to a periodic coloring. The Vamana* Purana* tells us that Sri-Laksmi* is created in four
colorswhite, red, yellow, and blue (nila*)mainly showing her connection with the four varnas*, but also signaling a
decline in dharma similar to that involved in the course of the yugas (Vam*. P. 49,36-39). Thus, at the very least,
the blackness of the three figures seems to be a sign of the times, that is, of the arrival or onset of the Kali yuga.
Glimpses of Popular Settings and Continuations
A second frame of reference is provided primarily by ethnological considerations and is based on the fragmentary
evidence gathered from early texts outside the epic and from possible
10 Presumably this means "without you taking part in the destruction." Ganguli-Roy translate "excepting
yourself," which would imply that Vyasa* was the sole survivor of the war, something the epic story will
not support. Ganguli-Roy then give alternate readings; ibid., p. 618, n. 3.

cult survivals. I rely here heavily on the reconstructions of Walter Ruben and Suvira Jaiswal.11
First, Buddhist stories in the Jatakas * refer to each of these figures as Kanha* (-a*), that is Krsna* (-a*). In some
instances, as Ruben observes, the stories seem to be slanderous distortions of the epic material. In others they seem
to rely on ancient local and cult traditions which may have influenced not only the formation of the stories, but
aspects of the epic as well. Jataka* 536 is a case of the first type. As Ruben says, Kanha* (Draupadi*) is
introduced as an example of vice. She marries the five Pandavas* out of sexual greed, and, when they are absent,
she lustfully seduces her attendant, a humpbacked cripple.12 As the scene is summarized in verse, the cripple is in
addition a dwarf:
In ancient story Kanha*, it is said,
A single maid to five princes was wed.
Insatiate still she lusted yet for more
And with a humpbacked dwarf she played the whore.13
Almost certainly this extramarital passion is a distortion or confusion of the relationship of Draupadi*, as Sri*
incarnate, with Visnu* in the latter's most easily derided form: the dwarf. If so, it provides testimony that the
identification of Draupadi* with Sri* was known, even if it was misrepresented, in Buddhist literature dating from
a relatively early period of the epic's literary formation.
A less slanderous representation is found in the Ghata Jataka* (Jataka* 454), which presents the other "two
Krsnas*" together

the kernel of Krishna Va-sudeva's* biography but a work of "polemical, malicious origin,"15 there is material of
interest. The story concludes with the fulfillment of the prophecy of the destruction of Dvaraka*, an episode found
in the Mausalaparvan of the Mahabharata*. But the two accounts differ. After his advice has helped Kanha*
Vasudeva* capture Dvaraka*, Kanhadipayana* (Krsna* Dvaipayana*) takes a place held in the epic (see Mbh.
16:2,4-10) by three other rsis*: it is he who is taunted and insulted by the Vrsni* youths (here the sons of the ten
brothers), one of whom dresses up as a pregnant woman; they ask the sage what kind of fruit or offspring "she"
will bring forth. Seeing that this is his moment to die, Kanhadipayana* prophesies that the masquerade will result
in the destruction of the family. The youths murder the visionary. His ashes are thrown into the river, but certain
plants emerge from them and turn into clubs which at a festival slay everyone except Kanha* Vasudeva*, Baladeva
(Balarama*), Anjanadevi*, and their chaplain.
Thus with no parallel in the Mahabharata* (where one never hears of Vyasa's* death), the death of
Kanhadipayana* is linked with that of Kanha* Vasudeva* (who dies after the festival) and with the destruction of
the latter's family. As to Anjanadevi*, who is born to Devagabbha* (?Devaki*), before her marriage to an
adventuresome figure named Upasagara*,16 she figures as

16 He replaces (?) Vasudeva; see above, n. 2. Having been expelled from his older brother's kingdom for
intrigues in the latter's zenana, he comes to Kamsa's* realm where he sees Devagabbha* (who is imprisoned to
prevent her from bearing a son), bribes her maidservant Nandagopa* to gain him entry to her tower, where the
two conceive Anjanadevi*. Ruben sees all this as a Buddhist denigration of Vasudeva*, whose parents will of
course be these same two lovers.

the elder sister of her ten legitimate brothers. In place of one of the brothers, she takes charge of one-tenth of the
earth over which the brothers have established sovereignty. She alone survives the final catastrophe.
Jaiswal views Anjanadevi * as a variant name for a strange figure in the family of Krishna and Balarama*. This is
Ekanamsa*, another older "sister," the girl born to Nanda and Yasoda* in the cow settlement who is exchanged for
Krishna to protect him from Kamsa* at birth.17 Once exchanged, her part in the usual story is brief: dashed against
a stone by Kamsa*, she rises into the sky to announce Krishna's birth and to predict Kamsa's* destruction.18 The
name Ekanamsa*, meaning "she alone who is without a portion," or "the single portionless one" (M-W), has been
variously explained. Ruben suggests "she who was no portion (of Visnu's*)."19 Another explanation stresses her
"blackness" (Jaiswal refers to her as "the black goddess Ekanamsa*"20): hers is a name for Kuhu* (Mbh. 3:208,8),
the dark invisible moon on the first day of the new moon; and this may be related to the Harivamsa's* notion that
Ekanamsa* is an incarnation of Visnu's* yoganidra*, the yogic sleep which lasts for a "night of Brahma*."21 In
any case, Jaiswal shows that in popular and local traditions, Ekanamsa* was identified, or at least grouped, with
the dark heroine of the Mahabharata*. A variant name for Ekanamsa* in certain Puranas* is Ekadasa* (the
"Eleventh," probably recalling the Jataka* tradition of her having ten brothers). According to the Lalitavistara,
Ekadasa* is "a goddess living in the west, along with seven other goddesses, such as Alumbusa*, Krsna*,
Draupadi*, etc."22 The association with

the west may indicate Dvaraka *. However, Ekanamsa's* fate seems to have been an increasing absorption into the
cults and identities of Durga* and Sri.*.23
One thus has a means of glimpsingoften through Buddhist sourcesthe kinds of links that were sometimes forged or
perceived between the epic figures and extraepic, often popular, traditions. In some respects the three Krsnas* are
more closely associated with each other in these sources than they are in the epic: just as Krishna's birth is marked
by the birth, self-sacrifice, and prophesies of his black "sister," his death is marked by the self-sacrificing death
and prophesies of Kanhadipayana*.
This does not imply, however, that the nominal blackness of each of these figures would always have the same
meaning. Here, our only good index is provided by the female member of the triad.24 As Madeleine Biardeau has
pointed out, the blackness of Draupadi* and her link with Sri* call to mind the
(Footnote continued from previous page)
Le Lalita Vistara, Annales du Musée Guimet, VI and XIX (Paris: Leroux, 1884-1892), Chapter 24, verse
137 (VI, 324), giving "Krsna-Draupadi*" as one of seven "daughters of the gods," all of whom are included
in the lengthy charm by which the Buddha, having just accepted food from two merchants seven weeks
after his enlightenment, calls for the protection of the merchants by the gods, goddesses, constellations, etc.,
of the four directions. Draupadi* is today also a goddess in South India, called "Drowpathi-Amman" or
"Panchali-Amman." At her temples, however, I was told either that she is not called Krishnai (Krsns*), or
that the name is used because she was a devotee of Lord Krishna. On wooden festival idols her skin is
painted pink, unlike Krishna's and Arjuna's.
23 Jaiswal, Origin and Development, p. 68.
24 Krishna's blackness is also pointed up in Tamil Sangam*> literature where he is named Mayon or Mayavan,
"the Black One"; see Bhagwansingh Suryavanshi, The Abhiras: Their History and Culture (Baroda: Maharaja
Sayajirao University, 1962), p. 72. As to triads, the three Krishnas must not be confused with another triad, two
brothers plus a woman, especially their sister or wife, such as is found with Vasudeva*, Balarama*, and
Subhadra* or with Rama*, Laksmana*, and Sita*. As both Ruben (Krishna, pp. 59-61) and Jaiswal (Origtn
and Development, pp. 127-28) suggest, this type of triad may recall very early cultic and legendary traditions
such as culminate (or survive?) in the cult of Jagannatha* at Puri*.

connection of both with the "prosperity" of the "black" earth.25 But I insist that this is not the primary sense in
which Draupadi * and Sri* are related in the epic.26 If earthy blackness and odor were the dominant features of
Draupadi's* divine antecedents, the epic poets would have done better to have made her an incarnation of Visnu's*
other wife, the goddess Earth, Bhudevi*.
Red, White, and Black
A third approach to the "three Krsnas*" may perhaps get us closer still to the symbolism of their common color,
but the degree of speculation is higher than heretofore. It is suggested by G. J. Held's conception of a triadic
circulatory marriage system in the epic, a system which he also sees reflected in the triads of the trimurti* and the
three gunas*27 One may agree with Held that this latter pair of groupings is related,28 and, moreover, that the
triadic relationship that exists between the epic's dominant "families"the "phratry"-like pair of the Pandavas* and
Kurus, and the "mediating" third group, the Yadavas*bears a similar structure.
25 See Biardeau, "Brahmanes* et potiers," Article liminaire, Annuaire de l'EPHE, LXXXIX (1971-1972),
4o-41; idem, Clefs, p. 187; in the former she notes that both Indian myths and Vaisesika* philosophy
attribute blackness and odor to the earthqualities shared by Krsna-Draupadi* and Vyasa's* mother
Satyavati* or Kali* ("Black") and the latter's son Vyasa* (for whose smell, gandha, see Mbh. 1:99,42-43).
Throughout India, of course, goddesses are frequently associated with blackness, not the least Kali* herself,
but also South Indian goddesses (among whom one finds Draupadi*; see above, n. 22) who, in some cases
(Mundla Mudamme, Kulagollamma) are associated with black stones; see Wilber Theodore Elmore,
Dravidian Gods in Modern Hinduism; A Study of Local Village Deities in Southern India, University
Studies, X, no, 1 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 1915), 69 and 74.

In the societal groupings, Held sees the basic triadic system as infinitely extendable.29 Other families and their
members may be involved, particularly in the "mediating" position. This would seem to apply to the Pancalas * and
in particular to Draupadi*, for the latter, both in her Svayamvara* (marriage rite by "Self-Choice") and in the dice
game, is a figure who stands between the two sides, offering and presenting judgments on both. In the former case,
she chooses the Pandava* Arjuna over a host of suitors, including the Kaurava Duryodhana. In the other, she
stands in the assembly hall amid her husbands and the Kauravas, provides the arguments by which it becomes moot
whether Yudhisthira*, the oldest Pandava*, has truly gambled her away, and thus saves the day for her husbands.
Concerning this propensity to mediate, what is true of Krsna* Draupadi* is true of the "three Krsnas*." Where
stress and opposition, as well as rituals and games, occur between the two "phratries," at least one of the "three
Krsnas?" is usually in a position to mediate between them. In fact, all three have their key moments. Along with
Draupadi* rescuing the Pandavas* from the Kurus at the dice game, we find Krishna representing the Pandavas*'
cause to the Kurus on his "peace mission,30 and Vyasa* (along with Narada*) "standing" between the missiles of
Arjuna and Asvatthaman* (insofar as the latter represents the Kurus), saving the three worlds and ultimately, with
additional help from Krishna, the Kuru-Pandava* line.31
It is not, however, just a matter of three "black" mediators, but of a wider color symbolism, for, as I will insist
again later,32 the Mahabharata* has dressed a number of prominent themes in rich and suggestive hues. I have
already mentioned color associations that pertain to the yugas and varnas*. Here, however, we are concerned with
one of the "circulatory" triads men-

tioned by Held in connection with the epic "families": the three gunas *. Well-known color associations belong to
these three "strands" of matter (prakrti*), of which sattva, linked with lucidity, is white; rajas, dynamic energy, is
red; and tamas, the tendency toward entropy, is black.
Now there is evidence, unfortunately somewhat tenuous on one point, that these same three colors are associated
with the two and their three mediators. As the latter are definitely black, the Pandavas* are most readily connected
with the color white and the Kauravas, perhaps distantly, with the color red. With the exception of Arjunawho,
despite his name ("White, Silver"), is described as dark33the Pandavas'* connection with whiteness seems to stem
initially from their father Pandu*, whose name means "Pale" or "White." In the text itself, however, I have located
only one passage where a red-white contrast appears, and unfortunately it is somewhat ambiguous. With battle
looming, Karna* tells Krishna of a vision he has had in which he saw the Pandavas* dressed in white turbans
(svetosnisah*) and white garments (suklavasasah*; 5:141,28), and, on Duryodhana's side, either "all the kings"
(sarve ... parthivah*; Northern recension) or "all the Kauravas" (... kauravah*; Southern recension) dressed in red
turbans (raktosnisah*; 141,39). In the passage itself, these colors seem to denote the survivors (white) and the slain
(red) in the upcoming battle, as all the other survivors but Krishna Satyaki* (36), Asvatthaman*; Krpa*,
Krtavarman* (39)are envisioned, along with the Pandavas*, in white apparel. But the Southern recension's
insistence that it is the Kauravas in particular, and their army only in general, whose headgear is red may rely on a
long tradition. Alfred Ludwig first suggested a red-white opposition, backing up his association of the Kurus with
red by showing that the name "kuru" itself sometimes carries the connotation "red."34 Related symbolisms are

sometimes found in adaptations of the Mahabharata * story to drama: the South Indian Kathakali dances and the
Indonesian shadow puppet theater, the Wayang Kulit or, as it concerns the epics, the Wayang Purva.35
Clearly, one cannot attribute such epic colorations simply to the model of the three gunas*. As Victor Turner has
shown, the gunas* themselves seem to be an Indian philosophical utilization of a far more archaic and universal
systematization of a basic color triad.36 Turner's study of the symbolism of these colors in African and other
cultures may help us to appreciate some of the connotations of blackness as a term in this triad, and, in turn, to
interpret some of the meanings of the blackness of the "three Krishnas" in their roles as mediators between the
representatives of the two other hues.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
Ethnological Study, p. 297 and n. 1. Ludwig cites a Kuruvarnaka* people mentioned in some Northern
manuscripts (see CE notes to 6:10,15), taking their name as "'kuru'-colored"; he also cites kurupisangila* (a
color mixed from "kuru" and yellow); kuruvaka (red amaranth); kuruvinda, kuruvilva (or -bilva; ruby);
kurunga* ("bloodshot eye"), and other compounds. See also the plate facing p. 121 of the CE
Bhismaparvan* depicting the Bhagavad Gita* scene where the dark Arjuna and Krishna converse between
white- and red-clad armies.
35 On Kathakali colors, see Clifford R. Jones and Betty True Jones, Kathakali: An Introduction to the Dance-
Drama of Kerala (San Francisco: American Society for Eastern Arts, 1970), pp. 23-35. According to them, the
basic triad is white-red-black (p. 35), with other colorsespecially green for good heroesin permutations. On
Wayang Purwa, see especially H. Ulbricht, Wayang Purwa: Shadows of the Past (Kuala Lumpur: Oxford
University Press, 1970), p. 36: "Red, black, white and gold predominate.... Red symbolizes opposition to the
cosmic order, black and white that the body is under the control of a mind which is reconciled with the
universe, and gold stands for the splendour of youth.... The difference between black and white seems to be
that black, the color of the ascetics, indicates harmony with the other world while white, the color of noble
warriors, expresses righteousness on earth."
36 Turner, The Forest of Symbols (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), pp. 85-86 (the gunas*) and 90:
"Since the experiences the three colors represent are common to all mankind, we do not have to invoke
diffusion to explain their wide distribution. We do have to invoke diffusion to explain why other colors ... are
ritually important in certain cultures."

Turner's main contention is that the three colors owe their universality to their ability to "epitomize the main kinds
of universal human organic experience"37: white associated with milk, semen, life; red with blood and thus with
both childbirth (life) and bloodshed (death); black with cessation of consciousness ("black out"), death, and
sometimes (although rarely explicitly) feces and urine. These psychobiological experiences are then the basis for a
wide fan of related social and cosmic referents which appear in rituals, myths, speculations, and so on.38
As regards the particular colors, Turner indicates that although a brief summary of the Ndembu material would
identify whiteness as positive, redness as ambivalent, and blackness as negative, the latter color is highly
multivalent. "Black is very often the neglected member of the triad" (p. 79), and, according to Turner, "its very
absence may be significant since it is the true emblem of the hidden, the secret, the dark, the unknown and perhaps
also of potentiality as opposed to actuality" (pp. 81, 73). Along these lines, Turner shows that when the triad is
reduced to dyads, white/black oppositions occur predominantly in abstract, conceptualized contexts while white/red
oppositions occur most often in concrete, actual, ritual situations. Moreover, "Where a twofold classification of
things as 'white' or 'red' develops, with black either absent or hidden, it sometimes happens that red acquires many
of the negative and undesirable attributes of blackness, without retaining its better ones" (p. 80). And finally, in a
specific instance, he mentions that blackness (alluvial mud as a symbol of love) "may repre-
37Ibid., p. 88.
38 Turner contends that life-crisis rituals provide the primary context in which these colors are applied, but one
will note that the Ndembu root their ritual usage of the colors in the myth that the rivers of the three colors
have their source in the High God Nzambi (ibid., pp. 61-62,68). It thus does not seem necessary to take myth
(or for that matter legend) as a secondary elaboration.

sent the cessation of hostilities between two intermarrying groups."39
When we turn to the Mahabharata *, all these remarks are highly suggestive. One thinks immediately of the
hiddenness and mysteriousness of Vyasa*, who, setting his mind on asceticism, disappears into the forest at the
moment of his birth, telling his mother Satyavati-Kali* that he will appear when she needs him (1:57,70-71); he
mysteriously reappears throughout the narrative in complicated and threatening situations. There are also two
"significant absences" of Krishna, to be discussed in later chapters.40 And all "three Krishnas" serve in various
situations to "represent" (through marriage, counsel, consolation, embassies, and so on) the cessation of hostilities
between the two groups.
Still more significant, however, is Turner's observation of a contrast between the "actual" and the "potential." The
actual war between the Pandavas* and the Kurus, between the white and the "red," confronts the two groups as a
dyad in which the latter, the ambivalent Kurus,41 "acquire many of the negative and undesirable attributes of
blackness." But in the hidden, mysterious workings of the "three Krsnas*" are the potential, the resources, to bring
the conflict to cessation, whether through peace or, as happens, through war. More particularly, the "three Krsnas*"
have a common ability to turn moments of stress and conflict, where the Kurus and/or adharma appear to be on the
verge of triumph, into scenes of victory for the Pandavas* and "subtle dharma," suksmo* dharmah*.42 Dharma in
such

41 The "inversionist" theories of the epic, associated with uncle-nephew team of the two Adolf Holtzmanns,
sought to explain the ambiguous character of such "noble foes" as Duryodhana and Karna* by supposing that
the "original epic" favored their "party."
42 For instance, most clearly in the actions of Draupadi* in the dice game, of Vasudeva* in the battle, and of
Vyasa* in justifying Draupadi's* marriage.

instances is always "subtle," hidden, and ambiguous: the three Krsnas *, by representing, using, and expressing this
subtlety, thus represent the potential for restoring dharma out of adharma, even by the apparent use of the latter. It
can thus be no coincidence that all three are incarnations of the "family of Visnu*," the god who appears, from
yuga to yuga, to restore dharma (Bhagavad Gita* 4,8). Also significant is their triple appearance at a turning of the
ages, between two yugas, in a sort of "liminal" time during which dharma and adharma are in a state of flux. In
this context their blackness can signify a restoration of dharma, perhaps provisional, and, as the first section of this
chapter suggested, an anticipation of the dark age to come.
Vaisnava* Triads
A final approach to the "three Krsnas*" concerns their number. Dumezil* has drawn attention to an analogous
situation: India knows three Ramas*.43 Dumezil* has not gone out on any limbs to interpret this fact, as there is
nothing to suggest that the three Ramas* form a coherent structure on their own. But his frame of reference, his
hint at what such a structure might be, is roughly trifunctional: Parasurama*, "Rama* with the Axe," is a brahmin;
Rama* Dasaratha*, the Dharmaraja* of the Ramayana*, is a ksatriya*; and Balarama*, Krishna Vasudeva's*
brother, is the plow-bearing, wine-drinking hero widely recognized for his associations with agriculture.44 This is
also their order of appearance.
The "three Ramas*" share certain traits, at least in essentials, with the "three Krsnas*." First, whereas the latter are
all in-
43 Dumezil*, Destiny of the Warrior, p. 72; ME, I, 113. The first to call attention to this triad of Ramas*
seems to have been Hermann Jacobi, Das Ramayana* (Bonn, 1893), p. 135; see S. N. Ghosal, trans., The
Ramayana*: Das Ramayana* of Dr. Hermann Jacobi (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1960), pp. 100-1. Jacobi
argues unconvincingly that Rama* Dasaratha* and Balarama* are eastern and western variant forms of
Indra.

carnations of Visnu's * "household," the former are all more specifically avataras* of Visnu* himself. The major
difference is that whereas the "three Krsnas*" appear synchronically, all in the same time span, the three Ramas*
appear separately, scheduling themselves diachronically, in different yugas, in accord with the avatara* doctrine.
Second, and still more intriguing, as Jacobi points out: "The word Rama* means 'black,' 'dark colored' in the Veda,
but in the classical Sanskrit'delightful,' 'lovely.'45 One can only wonder at this coincidence. As far as I know, the
second connotation always predominates in the descriptions of Rama* Dasaratha*, but it is certainly possible that
the older meaning, or a combination of the two meanings, may have provided the three Ramas* with their original
names.
Admitting the danger of interpreting one mute or unstated structure by referring it to another, certain coincidences
do occur, for possibly in both cases there is a residual trifunctional symbolism reflected in the disposition of
Visnu* or his "household" to be apportioned in such threesomes. In fact, in the case of the "three Krsnas*," a
trifunctional interpretation suggests itself as easily as in that of the "three Ramas*": Vyasa* is a brahmin and a rsi-
poet* (suta*), the highest exemplar of "Vedic" teaching; Vasudeva* is a ksatriya*; and Draupadi*, in addition to
being a woman, is Sri*, "Prosperity" incarnate, affiliated with the "black" earth.46
Each of these threesomes would thus seem to represent a totality. The central figures in whom Visnu* incarnates
himself (Rama* Dasaratha*, Krishnaboth ksatriyas*) are flanked by mysterious satellites who complement them,
whether their tasks be performed simultaneously or at different times. The characterization by the functions is
admittedly loose and provisional,47
45 Jacobi, The Ramayana*, p. 100, n. 74.
46 See above, n. 25.
47 It is worth noting, however, that neither with the Ramas* nor the Krsnas* can the three identifications be
reduced to caste: neither Balarama* nor Draupadi* is a vaisya*.

and I do not wish to go further on this limb than Dumezil *. But it may possibly explain not only why the three
Krsnas* are black, but why they are three. It also presents an appropriate arrangement whereby Visnu*, the god
associated with the restoration of dharma, can appear, along with his consort Sri*, in forms that are related to three

Chapter 3
The Marriage of Draupadi *
The epic Krishna becomes more tangible as we move to some of the episodes in which he appears. Mine is not the
first attempt to follow his involvement from scene to scene, but I believe the paths my few predecessors have taken
have either covered unyielding terrain or gone off in thin air. First are thoseled by Hopkins and Tadpatrikarwho
have sought out only what they judged to be of historical plausibility.1 Second are those led by Walter Rubenwho
have envisioned an epic originally without Krishna and sought to show Krishna's superfluousness to the "main
story."2 This second fancy must occasionally be dispelled, and nowhere is there a better starting point than
Krishna's first Mahabharata* appearance: his presencedeclared "unnecessary" by Ruben because he comes only to
watch, not to participate3at Draupadi's* wedding ceremony, her Svayamvara* or "Self-Choice."
This status as a spectator is not insignificant. First let us recount the events that set the background for the
Svayamvara*

scene. The childhood and adolescent conflicts between the Kurus and Pandavas * have just come to a head in the
lacquer house episode, in which Duryodhana's scheme to burn the Pandavas* and Kunti* in this firetrap has been
foiled. To prevent news of their escape and thus forestall further attempts on their lives, they travel disguised as
brahmins, or more exactly as brahmacarins*, and settle in a brahmin's house in the town of Ekacakra*. There, on
two occasions (1:153 and 157), they hearthe second time from Vyasa*about the upcoming wedding ceremony of
Draupadi*, the princess of Pancala*. Intrigued, they make their way to the capital of this kingdom and take up
residence where their concealment may be maintained: in the "atelier" of a potter (kumbhakarasya* salayam*;
1:176,6) of the Bhargava* line (282,1; 183,2; 184,1).4
Draupadi's* marriage to the Pandavas* has provided one of the most important keys to the Wikander-Dumezil*
analysis of the epic, for Draupadi* complements this trifunctional team of brothers in a way reminiscent of several
Indo-European goddesses.5 Some of the issues raised by these two authors will be discussed in Chapter 7, but here,
where the focus is more directly on Krishna, let us note an observation by Biardeau: Draupadi's* marriage to five
husbands is "the result of an intervention by Siva*."6 This is true of both of the stories known to the epic which
account for her multiple marriage.7 In one case, as Vyasa* tells it twice (1:157,6-14; 189,41-49), Draupadi*, in a
4 Biardeau's interpretation of this curious scene is most suggestive: in their present condition, the
Pandavas* embody the union of the brahman and the ksatra* powers, a condition also found in legends
about members of the Bhargava* gotra and in the cult of the South Indian god Aiya Nar-Sasta* who is
served by potter-priests; see "Brahmanes* et potiers," pp. 31-37, 45-55.

ME, I, 111, and below, Chapter 7.
7Mark*. P. knows another version which omits Siva*, which Dumezil* thinks is older: ME, I, 113-16. But the
Mahabharata* is consistent in relating her to Siva*; 18:4, 10 speaks of her as nirmita* sulapanina*, "fashioned
by the holder of the trident" (that is, by Siva*); see also below, Chapter 7.

former life, was an anxious maiden whose repeated requests for a * husband were granted by Siva* to the number
(five) of her entreaties.8 In the other (1:189,1-39), also recounted by Vyasa*, it was as Sri* herself that, in a most
curious scene, she witnessed the subjugation by the dice-playing Siva* of five Indras, and, when the latter obtained
Siva's* agreement to let them take birth as "five Indras among men" (the Pandavas*), she (Sri*) was appointed by
Siva* to be their human wife (Draupadi*).
Biardeau draws these two scenes together. In both accounts, she points out, the adharmic side of Draupadi's*
irregular marriage is initiated by Siva*: "When Siva* intervenes and breaks the rules of the ideal society, it is
always with an eye to destruction, but a destruction necessary to the renewal of the world."9 In the legend of the
overanxious maiden, it is Siva's* insistence on the polyandric marriage that introduces the adharmic note; and in
the myth of the five Indras, it is his intoxication with dice that not only sets up the conditions for the marriage but
links the marriage symbolically with (a) the dice game between the Kurus and Pandavas*, and (b) the course of the
yugasthe names for which are those of different dice throwswhich in themselves comprise a steady waning of
dharma.10 Against this background, let us now follow Krishna through the Svayamvara* episode. Siva* is not
alone in working behind the scene.
Krishna first appears when Dhrstadyumna*, Draupadi's* brother, calls the roll of those present at the Svayamvara*.
Krishna is there with his kinsmen (177,16-17), and when Dhrstadyumna* completes his announcements, he does
not exclude Krishna when he says to Draupadi*: "These and many others ... have come for the purpose of
obtaining you" (177, 21). As the scene develops, it is said that the limbs of all were

overcome by the god of love (samkalpajenapi * pariplutangah*; 178,3), making them rise up in unison with the
words "Krsna* [Draupadi*] shall be mine" (ibid.). But is Krishna really among those who are so affected, and is
he really a suitor? The words of Walter Ruben are instructive: Krishna comes "without doing anything on his own,
but as a spectator."11 Indeed, in this status of "spectator" Krishna is "in action" for the first time.
In the first words to describe Krishna and Balarama*, it is said that, along with their kinsmen, they "made a
viewing" (preksam* sma cakrur; 178,8) of the scene. In this posture, they are distinguished from the "other
various sons and grandsons of kings with [their] inner natures, minds, and eyes set on Krsna*" (anye tu
nananrpaputrapautrah* krsnagatairnetramanahsvabhavaih*; 178,11). But if Krishna and his kinsmen are the only
ones not obsessed by the sight of her, their gaze wanders to something else that interests them greatly: it is their
first sight of the Pandavas*. Krishna is the first to see beneath their brahmin disguises. He meditates upon them
(parthan* pradadhyau; 178,9) and then informs Rama* who, "having surveyed [niriksya*] them slowly and
gradually, looked back at Janardana* pleased in mind" (178,10). These various emphases on "sight" (see also 180,
17-22) certainly support the view that Krishna is a spectator, not a participant, at the Svayamvara*. Nor is he
mentioned as one of those who attempts to string the bow that must be shot to win Draupadi's* hand.
Krishna's spectator role does not, however, mark him as an extraneous figure. First one is reminded of Held's
notion that there is a circulatory clan relationship in which Krishna and the Yadavas* are mediators between the
Pandavas* and the Kurus.12 Here, on the one side, Arjuna is successful in stringing the bow, on the other
Duryodhana, although he is not mentioned as one of those to take a turn with it, is the first named by
Dhrstadyumna* in his roll call of those who have come to seek

Draupadi's * hand ( 17,1). This scene thus finds its place among others where Krishna appears betwixt and between
the two sides and in inactive, nonparticipant roles.13 Nonetheless, he is always able to maintain his favoritism for
Arjuna and the Pandavas*. The scene brings up a problem of myth and epic: if Visnu's* consort is Sri-Laksmi*
what is Krishna's relationship with Draupadi*, Sri* incarnate, who is now about to marry Krishna's closest ally (or
allies) and who maddens everyone with desire except Krishna himselfand his kinsmen? To untangle this second
matter takes us back to the role of Siva*.
After Arjuna has succeeded with the bow where all others have failed, and after Arjuna and Bhima*still
disguisedhave fought off all the assembled ksatriyas* who are outraged that Draupadi* should be a brahmin's prize,
Krishna intercedes: "He caused those lords of earth to be restrained, saying: 'She has been won righteously'
[dharmena labdheti], thus conciliating them all" (181,32). Hearing his appeasing words, all the wonder-struck
(vismitah*) kings stop their fighting and abruptly return to their respective realms (181,33). We are told that the
wrath of the kings and princes against King Drupada for slighting them by bestowing his daughter on a brahmin
was justified by a precept of sruti*: "The Svayamvara* is for ksatriyas*" (180,6). But Krishna, thanks to his secret
recognition of the Pandavas* (this is again stressed just before his statement; 181,32ab), is able to say: "She has
been won in accordance with dharma." He is, of course, correct, and his authority, in this instance, goes
unchallenged.
So far, however, Krishna sanctions only the first stage in Draupadi's* marriage; it only concerns Draupadi* and
Arjuna. The crucial test of dharma is the "adharmic" situation instigated by Siva*: the polyandric marriage. And on
this troublesome point, when it comes to those who justify and approve, we
13 Krishna is "placed" between the two sides when he awakens from his sleep to find Duryodhana and
Arjuna requesting his aid in battle (see below, Chapter 5), in his "peace mission" (see below, Chapter 6), in
the Bhagavad Gita's* setting, and, in general, in his noncombatant status during the war.

meet a most interesting group. First, as we have seen and as Biardeau has stressed, Vyasa * continually delivers the
stories of Siva's* decreefirst to the "dharmic" Pandavas* and then to Drupadaas a "just" imposition. In this, says
Biardeau, there is nothing illogical: "Vyasa*, one of the two epic incarnations of Narayana*, is justly indicated to
transmit the message and answer for this act of shocking appearance: he represents the positive and reconstructive
phase of this restoration of the social order, of which Siva* symbolizes the destructive phase."14 But this is not all.
In the richer and, in my view, most important of the stories justifying the marriagethe myth of the five Indrasit is
not simply a matter of Siva* decreeing that Sri* will have the five "Indras among men" as her terrestrial husbands.
As soon as he has so "ordained" [vyadadhat*]: "The god [Siva*] then, indeed together with them [presumably the
five Indras and Sri*15] went to the immeasurable [apramemayam] Narayana*; and he [Visnu-Narayana*] also
ordained [vyadadhat*] all this. Then all took birth on earth" (189,30).
The verb vi-dha-*, used here in connection with both Siva* and Visnu*, has many connotations, and it seems
likely that whereas Siva's* part is simply to "ordain," Visnu's* is more complex. Monier-Williams gives six basic,
nonspecialized meanings for the verb, the first five of which are: (1) to distribute, apportion, grant; (2) furnish,
supply; (3) put in order, arrange; (4) ordain, enjoin; (5) form, create. Do we then view Narayana* as "granting" that
this may happen, even "bestowing" or "supplying" his own wife to the five Indras? Does he "apportion" the others'
lots (excepting Siva's*)? Does he put in order, even "form" or "create,"16 where Siva* has initiated disorder and
destruction? I doubt that one can totally dismiss any of these possibilities,
14 Biardeau, "Brahmanes* et potiers," p. 39 (my translation).
15 Ganguli-Roy, Mahabharata*, I, Adi Parva, 418, takes tair as referring only to the Indras, but what follows
implies that Sri* is present too, being among the sarve ("all") who take birth on earth.
16 The related substantive, vidhatr*, often means Creator.

but the verb's total range of meaning would in any case seem to imply a connection between Visnu-Narayana's *
"approval" and dharma. Thus it is not only Vyasa*, one of Narayana's* incarnations, who lends dharmic approval
to the polyandric marriage, but Narayana* himself. And what about Visnu-Narayana's* other incarnation, Krishna?
Does he give approval to this second stage of Draupadi's* marriage as well as the first? Yes, this time not by
referring to it explicitly as meeting the precepts of dharma, but by an act which is itself an implicit sanctioning of
its virtuousness: the bestowal of wedding gifts (191,13-18).
The marriage of Draupadi* is thus part of a vaster theological drama that involves, at numerous levels, both Siva*
and Visnu-Narayana*. This was hinted at by Biardeau, but as we have seen, not only Vyasa* but Krishna and
Narayana*. deepen the Vaisnava* "restorative" contribution. The various collaborations between different figures
are of interest. We see the three Krsnas*Vyasa*, Draupadi*, and Vasudeva*mysteriously working to a common
end. But more than this, if it is Siva's* role to instigate or signal the disruption of dharma, it is the role of Krishna,
Vyasa*, and Narayana* first to sanction that disruption and, moreover, to perceive the hidden structure of dharma
even while it has been suspended and to preserve it through its suspension. Thus, even while dharma wanes, it is
being preserved in kernel, in essence, in the actions of Arjuna, the Pandavas*, and Draupadi* which only Krishna
and Vyasa* perceive in their true contextas dharma.

Chapter 4
Krishna's Absence from the Dice Game and the Disrobing of Draupadi *
After his appearance at Draupadi's* Svayamvara*, Krishna is involved in several incidents. Staying with the
Pandavas* a while after the wedding, he is present when they accept half the Kuru kingdom and set up residence at
Khandavaprastha*; indeed, Krishna leads them (pandavas* ... krsnapurogamah*) to this "terrible forest" (ghoram*
vanam; 1:199,26-27) and helps them, along with Vyasa*, to build the heavenlike city of Indraprastha (199,28-47).
Back home at Dvaraka*, he encourages Arjuna to abduct Subhadra*, Krishna's own sister, from a festival so as to
assure her compliance in marriage (1:211-213). Then, coming to Indraprastha to celebrate Arjuna and Subhadra's*
wedding, he stays for the birth of their son Abhimanyu and performs the birth ceremonies for this new and beloved
nephew (1:213,55-64). This visit includes Krishna in one of the strangest scenes of the epic, the burning of the
Khandava* forest.1 Before he leaves he asks the Asura Maya to build the Pandavas* their magnificent hall, "a
sabha*

where we may see arranged designs that are godly, asuric, and human" (2:1,11)in fact, the very architecture that
will make a fool of Duryodhana, leading him to covet the Pandavas' * prosperity (sri*; 2:43,13 and 17) and to
formulate his plan to divest them of it by inviting them to a dice game (43,13). Last, Krishna is invited to
Indraprastha to advise Yudhisthira* on the latter's wish to perform a Rajasuya*, the "royal consecration" ceremony
which confers the title of samraj*, "universal sovereign" (2:12,11-12). Encouraging Yudhisthira* to perform this
rite, Krishna helps Arjuna and Bhima*, before it begins, to dispose of Yudhisthira's* single rival, King
Jarasamdha* of Magadha; and then, during the rite, he prevents its disruption by slaying Jarasamdha's*
obstreperous marshal Sisupala*. These two episodes have received their most satisfactory treatment in a beautiful
study by Dumezil*,2 some of whose conclusions I will draw from in later chapters. From the building of the
Pandavas'* sabha* through the performance of the Rajasuya*, we have entered the Mahabharata's* second book,
the Sabhaparvan*.
At the successful conclusion of the Rajasuya* sacrifice, Krishna goes home (2:42,51-58). He is not involved in the
climactic scenes which close the Sabhaparvan*: the two dice games which result in the Pandavas'* humiliation,
loss of kingdom, and exile to the forest. I will not discuss the dice games here in any detail.3 Rather, noting that
Walter Ruben sees Krishna's absence from this "turning point" as worthy of an exclamation point in support of his
thesis that the original story did without Krishna,4 let us examine this matter of

absence more closely.5 It is taken up by Krishna himself on his first visit to the Pandavas * at the beginning of their
period of exile in the forest. We are now in the Aranyakaparvan*, and the Pandavas* have already received two of
the many illustrious visitorsVidura and Maitreyawho will come to console them, on their forest travels, with
edifying discourses that bear only a tangential relationship to the course of the epic drama. Krishna will make
another visit, and a third visit by him is interpolated. Here, however, there are no illuminating tales or exhortations,
and the relationship of this visit to the preceding events of the Sabhaparvan*, and to what ultimately follows, is
direct and, in my view, of considerable importance.
The visit serves one clear purpose: it reaffirms Krishna's relationship with the Pandavas* after his absence during
their time of distress at the dice game. In particular, he reconsolidates this relationship by a series of exchanges
with Yudhisthira*, Arjuna, and Draupadi*. To Yudhisthira*, whom he had helped consecrate as samraj*, he
promises consecration anew and, his wrath mounting, punishment of his enemies (3:13,5-6). To Arjuna, who must
pacify Krishna's anger by recounting his past deeds,6 he recalls their identity as Nara and Narayana* (13,37-40).
Most significant is the exchange with Draupadi*; their words point beyond the surface events to the mythological
identities of the figures involved.
Draupadi* speaks first. Recognizing each of her five husbands as an "equal of Indra" (pancanamindrakalpanam*;
13,108); acknowledging Krishna as "Visnu*," as "the sacrifice, the
5 Actually, a famous tradition does have Krishna appear at the dicing scene; in an episode recounted in
numerous versions (see CE notes following 2:61,40), Draupadi*, distressed over Duhsasana's* efforts to
disrobe her, calls on Krishna to rescue her. But Franklin Edgerton's work on the Sabhaparvan* CE proves
this an interpolation; see Edgerton, "Introduction," Sabhaparvan*, CE, pp. xxvii-xxix.
6 3:13,10-36: a strange list, accenting past lives (?) as an ascetic (10-14) and sacrificer (16-17,21-22), plus
triumphs over human and demonic foes. The one avatara* reference has Krishna traverse the three worlds as a
child (sisu*) rather than a dwarf (24).

sacrificer, and he for whom the sacrifice is to be performed" (tvam * yajno* ... yasta* tvamasi yastavyo*; 13,44),
as well as a number of related identities (43-52), she asks: "How then, being the wife of the Parthas* [=five
Indras], your friend [sakhi*], O Krishna [= Visnu*], and the sister of Dhrstadyumna* [= Agni], could one like me
be dragged into the sabha*?" (53.)7 Her tale of woe continues at some length (to sloka* 108), followed by tears,
sighs, and the concluding "angry words" that she has truly neither husbands, sons, brothers, father, nor friends if all
this could happen to her (112-13).
In response to this expression of tears, anger, and bereftness, Krishna replies:
Surely the wives of those at whom you are wrathful shall also weep, O angry [or radiant] one [bhamini*],
[seeing their husbands] covered with the arrows of Arjuna, bathed in torrents of blood, slain, having
abandoned life, lying on the earth's surface. Whatever is suitable for the Pandavas*, that I will do. Do not
grieve. I promise you truly: you shall be the queen of kings [rajnam* rajni* bhavisyas]. The sky might fall,
Himavat might split, the earth might be rent, the ocean might dry up, O Krsna*, but my word shall not be
vain. [13, 114c-117]
Note the plural: Draupadi* (Krsna*!) will be the queen of kings. This is nothing but Krishna's reply-in-kind to
Draupadi's* question. Like her, he penetrates to the mythological identities of the principal figures: Draupadi*, the
queen of kings, is Sri*, "Prosperity," whose marriage to every king, not to mention the "five Indras among men," is
the sign of a virtuous reign. In symbolic terms, as Draupadi* says herself, she is without husbands, for, since they
have lost their kingdom, the relationship between them and herself as Sri*, "royal Prosperity," has

where, just before Krishna departs on his "peace mission" to the Kuru court, Draupadi reminds him that
even as his "dear friend" (priya* sakhi*; 21) and the wife of five husbands "resembling five Indras in
splendor" (pancendrasamavarcasam*; 22), she was dragged and insulted in the sabha*.

"dissolved." But although earth, sky, mountains, and ocean might be destroyedimagery of the pralaya or universal
"dissolution"their relationship shall once again, at Krishna's true word, be reconstituted.
It is altogether fitting that the destructive dice game, which has dissolved the royal relationship and identities of
Draupadi * and the Pandavas*, has occurred in Krishna's absence. As Biardeau has shown so well, in the
symbolism of the pralaya that pervades the epic at many points, the destructive role of Siva* is counterbalanced by
the reconstitutive role of Visnu-Narayana*. And during the time that each of these two great gods performs his
roleSiva* burning the three worlds, Visnu* lying on the cosmic oceaneach is alone; the other, if one may say so, is
out of the picture. Such a pattern of presences and absences is discussed again in Chapter 12.
Krishna, having just reaffirmed his consolidarity with the Pandavas* and Draupadi*, also provides a most thorough
and illuminating explanation of his absence and a response to the events which transpired without him. Had he
been at Dvaraka* when the game was announced, he would, he says, have come to Hastinapura* to prevent it.
First, addressing the Kuru elders, he would have sought to impress upon them the many evils of dicing, the very
worst vice of the "fourfold addiction" (vyasanam* catustayam*)women, dice, hunting, and drinking by which
"prosperity [sir*] vanishes" (3:14,7).8 Then, should his advice, "healthy for dharma" (anamayam* ... dharmasya;
11), go unheeded by Dhrtarastra* and Duryodhana, he would have stopped the game "by force" (balena; 12).
"However," he concludes, "my nonpresence [asamnidhyam*], being at that time among the Anartas*, has become
[the cause] by which you have obtained this calamity brought about by dice" (14).
Krishna then turns at great length to the matter that detained him away from Dvaraka*: his combat with King

Salval *, lord of the city of Saubha. The story is placed as a sequel to the Jarasamdha* and Sisupala* episodes, as
Sisupala* was Salva's* brother (3:15,13). Outraged at Sisupala's* death, Salva* had attacked Dvaraka* while
Krishna was still at Indraprastha, attending and protecting Yudhisthira's* Rajasuya* (3:21,1). Salva* destroyed all
the city gardens, slew many heroic Vrsni* youths (3:15,7), and led his army to a standoff fight against some of
Krishna's sons. In the featured match, however, PradyumnaKrishna's son by Rukmini*9was prevented from slaying
Salva* by Indra, Kubera, and the entire divine host (devaganah* sarve), who sent the rsi* Narada* and the Wind
(svasana*; 20,21) to tell Pradyumna: "It has been ordained by the Creator [dhatra*] that Krishna the son of
Devaki* shall be [the cause of] his death in battle" (20,24). This reminds one of the prophecy concerning Salva's*
brother Sisupala*,10 and the interest of the entire divine host suggests that Salva* is a figure of no mean
significance. One may even wonder at the gods' interference in this duel, for the postponement of Salva's* death
results in Krishna's fateful absence from the dice game. But we know little of the gods' interest in Salva's* death,
for his file is full of gaps. Although, like Jarasamdha* and Sisupala*, he is an incarnate Asura,11 his own pedigree
is a matter of doubt. Krishna refers to him as "an innately sinful descendent of Diti" (papaprakrtirdaiteya*; 21,19),
but it is only belatedly, in various Northern texts, that the epic connects him with a particular Asura, and this is the
inconsequential Ajaka (see notes to 1:61,17). Moreover, a glance at Sörensen's Index reveals the deplorable
situation of three,

Dumezil*, ME, II, 109-13, and 2:42,15.
10 See 2:40, 3-5 and 9-10: an "incorporeal voice" (vag* ... asaririni*; 3) reveals that the person who will

will vanish and his extra arms drop off.

and possibly four, Salvas * in the epic: one slain on each side in the great battle; one slain in the present episode by
Krishna; and one the cautious fiancé who refuses to marry the princess Amba*previously engaged to himafter she
and her two sisters were abducted from their Svayamvara* by Bhisma* (5:170-93, the Ambopakhyanaparvan*).
There is certainly one good reason to suppose that this last figure is identical with Krishna's victim: both are
referred to as Saubhapati, lord of Saubha (cf. 5:175,24; 176,2). But the two characterizations are markedly
different. In the famous Ambopakyhana*, Salva* is the king of an apparently earthly realm who refuses to marry
Amba* partially because of fear of Bhisma* (5:172,22). In the other, with Salva* seemingly raised to the status of
a foe of Krishna, Saubha becomes a remarkable sky-ranging city which goes wherever its lord wishes (3:15,6; cf.
20,27; 21,25), and which Krishna, with his discus, finally manages to split and dislodge from the sky, "like Tripura
shaken by the shaft of Mahesvara*" (32,24). After this, Krishna uses the cakra to divide Salva* himself in two and
burn him with its energy.
This is not the only conquest of an aerial city in Indian mythology,12 but the important point is that Salva's*
miraculous capacity as Krishna's foe contrasts sharply with his characterization as a potential opponent of
Bhisma*. This would seem to indicate that the two stories reflect different milieus with contrasting literary and
theological interests. Indeed, one may note further that Krishna's conquest of Salva* follows upon one of the few
incidents where the epic dwells at length on the exploits of Krishna's children. Moreover, unlike the slayings of
Jarasamdha* and Sisupala*, Krishna's conquest of Salva*, like his victory over Kamsa*which is also told to the
Pandavas* only as background information to more pressing
12 Ruben, Krishna, pp. 217-18, like the passage just cited, compares the conquest of Saubha with Siva's*
conquest of Tripura; see also Hiranyapura* (3:170,1), conquered by Arjuna, as mentioned in a note to me
by van Buitenen.

events (2:13,30-33)has direct concern only for Krishna's people, and not for the Pandavas *. In short, it would seem
that the Krishna-Salva* episode finds its closest analogues in stories, like the slaying of Kamsa*, which come to
their fullest expression in the Puranas*. One suspects that the Mahabharata* has elaborated here upon a fragment
of tradition about Krishna, a fragment similar to those in the list of sins against Dvaraka* and its people with
which Krishna charges Sisupala* before he slays him (2:42,7-11).13 Whether these and other fragments ever
formed a continuous narrative is debatable, but only this one episode, the conquest of Salva*, is given full dramatic
treatment in the Mahabharata*. This has probably been done to meet the structural requirements of the main epic
narrative, for it is a requirement that Krishna be absent from the dice game. As he has said, had he been there, the
result would have been different. And as he prepares to return to Dvaraka*, his closing remarks make the same
point: "For this reason, O king, I did not come to Hastinapura*; if I had come, surely Duryodhana would not be
alive" (3:23,41).
Putting this more into the terms of the epic scenarists, Krishna's absence from the dice game does not hinge so
much on this adventitious episode as on the fact that had he been present, the dice game could not have taken
place, or, perhaps better, could not have taken place with the same results. But his distance from and dislike of
dicing are consistent with his attitude elsewhere. It is not the only place where Krishna speaks out against
gambling. When, at the end of the war, Yudhisthira* stipulates that Duryodhana can still win back the kingdom
should he defeat just one Pandava* opponent of his own choosing in a mace duel, Krishna rebukes Yudhisthira*,
comparing this to the beginning of another dyuta* (dyutamarambham*) that will be "dangerous and uneven"
(visamam*; 9:32,7).

But Krishna is not the only divinity whom the epic characterizes by an attitude toward dicing. In fact, we are faced
with an intriguing, and probably quite significant, opposition. If, to begin with, Krishna is opposed to dicing, his
obvious counterpart is Siva *, whom the epic describes as "fond of dice" (aksapriya*).14 Perhaps one may see an
early trace of such an inclination where the Satarudriya* litany exclaims: "Homage to the cheater, the swindler, to
the lord of burglars homage."15 In any case, in the myth of the five former Indras, we find Siva* "exceedingly
intoxicated with dice" (aksaih* subhrsam* pramattam; 1:189,15) as he and Parvati* absorb themselves in the
game on the top of Mount Kailasa*. As we have already observed,16 Biardeau has argued that Siva's* connection
with dice in this scene has a symbolic link with the dice game in the Dyutaparvan* between the Kurus and the
Pandavas*:
Siva's* dicing with Parvati* atop Mount Kailasa* is rich in meaning if one recalls that it is at a throw of the
dice that the fate of the Pandavas* is played out, that the four yugas, or the four ages in which the course of
dharma declines, bear respectively the names of the four dice throws, and that the epic narrative is situated
at the juncture of the two last yugas, the game of dice being won by [Sakuni*] the incarnation of the Asura
Dvapara* (the next-to-last yuga) for the benefit of [Duryodhana] the incarnation of the Asura Kali (the final
yuga).17
These remarks should be supplemented by those of Held. Comparing Siva's* dice play to a "heavenly potlatch
ceremony," Held argued that dicing was a potlatchlike ritual game

played in a specially constructed sabha *, and then stated: "We are firmly convinced that the game of dice [the
game in the Dyutaparvan* being the case in point] has something to do with Rudra-Siva*."18 This conviction,
apparently shared by Biardeau, leads to our basic problem.
Some of Held's evidence for a connection between Siva* and ritual dicing is intriguing, for instance the
useaccording to himof wood from the house of the aksavapa*, "dice keeper," for Rudra's altar during the
Rajasuya* ceremony.19 Indeed, this ceremony, as it is described in the Brahmana* literature, shows other instances
where Siva* is associated with dicing. In Satapatha* Brahmana* 5, 3, 1, 10, during the Rajasuya*, Gavedhuka*
seeds are brought to the sacrificing king's house from the houses of the Aksavapa* and the "Slaughterer"
(Govikartana)an interestingly "destructive" pairand are made into a pap that is offered, as the last of the Ratnin
offerings, to Rudra. And Taittiriya* Samhita* 1, 8, 9 says of the same segment of the Rajasuya*: "To Rudra [he
offers] an oblation of Gavidhuka* in the house of the thrower of dice."20 All this leads to an important point made
by van Buitenen: just as in the ritual texts the Rajasuya* is concluded by a dice game,21 similarly, in the
Sabhaparvan*, Yudhisthira's* Rajasuya*, ostensibly complete,

p. 193 and n. 1, noting that the last day of the Divali* festival "is usually held to be an exceptionally lucky day
to gamble upon.... It is said that Siva*, playing at dice upon that day with his consort Parvati*, forfeited to her
all that he possessed."

21 See Heestermann, Ancient Indian Royal Consecration, p. 153; the dice game in the Rajasuya* "may be
considered a cosmogonical rite intended to bring about the recreation of the universe and the birth of the king."
If this interpretation of the Brahmanic* rite is correct, the inverse of this applies to Yudhisthira*, who loses the
game.

is technically incomplete without the dice game.22 Thus, if Rudra is significantly connected with the dicing that
concludes the Vedic ritual, there are additional reasonsbeyond those proposed by Biardeau and Heldto link him, at
least implicitly, with the dice game of the epic.
Biardeau and Held have thus led us to an impasse. They have shown the importance of Siva's * connection with
dicing and have pointed to a symbolic continuity between the two dicing scenes: the game between Siva* and
Parvati* and the game at the end of the Sabhaparvan*. But only by looking at the two dicing scenes in their full
complexity, with all the figures involved, can we see that "the game of dice [in the Dyutaparvan*] has something
to do with Siva*."
As Chapter 3 made clear, the dice game on Mount Kailasa* concerns not just Siva* and Parvati*, but Sri* and the
five Indras, and ultimately Visnu-Narayana*. The world's present Indra has followed a trail of tears-turned-to-
golden-lotuses to the source of the Ganges. There he meets the "ill-fortuned" (mandabhagya*) Sri*. The latter is
weeping because while Siva* and his spouse intoxicate themselves with dice, her husbands four former Indras
whom the fifth, our Indra, is now carelessly imitatinghave insulted Siva* by their folly and pride and have been
forced to lie dormant in a cave. At Siva's* insistence, only by being reborn in human wombs (as the Pandavas*)
can they perform karman that will regain them the "world of Indra." As for Sri*, Siva*, with Narayana's*
"approval," will allow her to rejoin them by taking birth as Draupadi*, their wife-in-common.
By viewing this not only as a myth about Siva* dicing, but as seen in Chapter 3as a myth about the dissolution and
restoration of the relationship between Sri* and the five Indras,
22 Van Buitenen, "The Sabhaparvan*," pp. 79-83; according to him, this parvan "borrowed its structure
from the Vedic rajasuya*...; two events in this book are so basic that they must have been given from the
beginning: the unction and the dicing" (p. 82). For an analogous continuity between royal legend and royal
ritual (the Vajapeya*), see Dumézil, ME, II, 359-60.

Krishna's explanation of his absence from the Dyutaparvan * dice game, his words to Draupadi*, and his
denunciation of dicing make sense. Indeed, the two dice games and their aftermaths provide a n umber of
instructive parallels, oppositions, and inversions, which I present graphically for the sake of the greatest simplicity
and clarity:

course of the yugas on a microcosmic moment "between the yugas," on an epic,

23 This question of status is the turning point around which the first "invitation" of the dice game revolves.
Draupadi* was the last stake bet by Yudhisthira* (2:58,32-43see sloka* 33, in which Yudhisthira*
compares her with Sri* and Laksmi*). Thus Draupadi's* first question (2:60,7) is whether Yudhisthira*
wagered her before or after himself, for if it were the latter, he was not her husband. This dangerous
question is never answered by Yudhisthira* and is evaded by Bhisma* (60,40-42 ;62,14-21); its insolubility
helps her win her husbands their freedom.

5. At Siva's * command,5. At Duryodhana's command (I draw here from a well-attested
the first four Indras symbolism) the Pandavas* must go through their forest exile
gestate in a cave; they stripped of their royal identities (wearing ascetic garb), after

with dicing (1:189,15).
It is not a matter here of myth providing the model for epic, or, for that matter, vice versa. The course of the epic
narrative strays too far from the story of the myth to suggest any significant structuring influence. For instance, the
two stories diverge sharply at point 5, leading into very different thematic areas which only I, and not the epic
poets, have contrived to put together. An important difference in direction and motivation is also indicated by the
following: whereas the Dyutaparvan* dicing scene involves an opposition between the Pandavas* and the
Kurusincarnating the Devas (in particular, the five Indras) and the Asuras (or Raksasas*)the dicing scene atop
Mount Kailasa* involves no Asuras, but a direct conflict between the boastful Indras and the higher god Siva*.
Rather, as Chapter 7 will seek to show, the myth of Siva* and the Indras has its analogue and prototype elsewhere.
And last, the myth is not told at a point adjacent to the epic episode: the poets have connected it with Draupadi's*
marriage, not her humiliation.
Given all these hesitations, however, clearly the words which Krishna exchanges with Draupadi*, and the words
with which

he denounces dicing, are heavy with mythological allusions. The references to the five "equals of Indra" (item 2),
to Sri * vanishing and to Draupadi's* loss of husbands (item 3), and to her once again becoming the "queen of
kings" (item 6) are all clear in their mythic import. And it is not just the general theme of the loss and return of
"Prosperity," but the specific myth of the former Indras, that makes this clarity apparent.
A lesson may be drawn here. There is more than one way in which myth and epic have been interrelated in the
Mahabharata*. While in some cases whole episodes are correlated with myths, in others, where there are moments
in the lives of the heroes and heroines that evoke mythical themes, the poets allow their personages to reveal
glimpses of their mythical identities and to relive, as it were, scenes from their "prior" mythical adventures. In the
present case, not just one allusion but a whole cluster of parallels makes the alignment of the two dicing scenes
meaningful and coherent. But it is not just the parallels that are coherentso too are the oppositions and inversions.
The pattern of Siva* being present and Krishna or Visnu* being absent at moments when violence is done to
dharma is one I will discuss at greater length in Chapter 12. In the present instances, however, the oppositions are
not wholly complete. In the myth, Siva* is present and Visnu-Narayana* is elsewhere, available for consultation
and his required approval; but only the first fact is given any weight in the telling. And in the epic, no matter how
"firmly convinced" one may be that "the game of dice has something to do with Rudra-Siva*," we are faced with a
near opposite situation: the only matter given weight, this time the only matter given mention, is the fact of
Krishna's absence. Our situation thus has the following look:
Myth:
SIVA* PRESENT Visnu* absent
Epic: (Siva* present [?] symbolically or implicitly)KRISHNA ABSENT
One might say, then, that the two episodes are constructed around different poles: in one case highlighting Siva*,

other, at least in its aftermath, Krishna. But from these polar emphases, the two episodes once again reveal their
complementarity. The opposite attitudes of the two "divinities" toward dicing can be appreciated as reflections
upon each other. If in the hands of Siva * and Sakuni* the dice reflect the course of the yugas, the increase of
adharma, the loss of "prosperity," and, in the case of Siva*, an intoxicated aloofness to matters of gain and loss,
there is a clear contrast with Krishna, who leaves nothing to chance. The arbitrary, addictive, and destructive
character of dicing runs counter to his application of suitable "means" for every perilous situation, his patient,
constructive efforts toward the "restoration of dharma."
Moreover, in terms of the construction of the epic story, the continuities demonstrated by van Buitenen between
the Dyutaparvan* and the Rajasuya* bring Krishna's absence from the former into a still sharper focus. According
to the Mahabharata*, "the great armed Janardana* [Krishna] protected that sacrifice [the Rajasuya* of
Yudhisthira*] until completion" (tam* tu yajnam* mahabahura* samapter* janardanah* / raraksa*; 2:42,34). But
as the poets no doubt knew,24 it was not really complete without a dice game, which, as Krishna says himself, the
Pandavas* could not have lost had he been present. The situation thus suggests two possibilities. Perhaps, out of
dramatic necessity, the poets simply provided an interval (the digvijaya, the "conquest of the regions" by
Yudhisthira's* brothers) between the Rajasuya* and the dice game in order to remove Krishna from the scene. Or,
viewing the entire parvan, including the digvijaya,25 as a coherent whole structured from
24 Van Buitenen, "The Sabhaparvan*," p. 78: "I do not pretend to propose that our present Sabha* 'grew'
out of a baronial account of the rajasuya*, but only that the composers of the parvan were aware of the
sequence of events in the Vedic rajasuya* and used it in building the narrative analogously."
25Ibid., see pp. 73-75; van Buitenen points to the parallels between the digvijaya and the Rajasuya* rite of the
digvyasthapana*.

beginning to end by the entire Rajasuya *, we may suppose some rapport between Krishna-Visnu* and the
sacrifice26 through the completion of its chief purpose, the unction; and, second, a similar rapportone certainly
hinted at in the Brahman* passages cited abovebetween Rudra-Siva* and the concluding segment of the rite, the
dicing. My leaning is toward the latter alternative. It seems to me that, whether or not we follow Biardeau and
connect the dicing with Siva* through the waning course of dharma through the yugas, we are presented in the
dicing segment, or sequel, of the Rajasuya*both in the epic and in the traditional ritewith an element of destructive
chance, randomness, which the king must overcome for his sovereignty to be complete. Indeed, as Heestermann
suggests,27 it is this gameif he "wins"which may symbolize the king's "recreation of the universe" and "new birth."
It is not difficult to see how this potentially destructive and random element would, or could, have been associated
with Rudra, or how Krishna, the exponent of dharma, would have taken exception to it.
26 The relation between Krishna, Visnu*, and the sacrifice will be treated more fully in Chapters 11 and
12; for the moment, recall Draupadi's* recognition of Krishna as "the sacrifice" (3:13,44) toward the
beginning of this chapter.

Chapter 5
Krishna and Odinn: Interventions
The study of Krishna in the Mahabharata *, as the last three chapters show, cannot be a study of Krishna alone,
but involves his relations to other heroes and heroines and his rapports, as avatara* of Visnu-Narayana*, with
many of the major divinities of the Hindu pantheon. But this is not all, for, as I will attempt to show, the Krishna of
the Mahabharata* sometimes takes us beyond India to the mythic and epic traditions of other Indo-European
peoples. I call attention now to two episodes from Germanic legends concerning Odinn which find close analogues
in consecutive scenes in the Mahabharata's* fifth book.
At the Waking Krishna's Bedside
After his first visit to the Pandavas* in the forest, Krishna sees them there two more times (3:118, 15-120; 3:180-
224), or three counting a clear interpolation (Aranyakaparvan*, Appendix I, No. 25). Then, after the Pandavas*.
have successfully concluded their year of concealment at King Virata's* court, Krishna brings Subhadra* and
Abhimanyu (who have stayed with him at Dvaraka*) to join them and attends the latter's wedding to Uttara*,
Virata's* daughter (4:67). This visit of the fourth book, the Virataparvan*, is extended to the beginning of the fifth,
the Udyogaparvan, or book of "preparations" for war. Meeting with the Pandavas* and their allies at Upaplavya, a
town in Virata's* kingdom, Krishna advises the Pandavas* to send a messenger to the Kurus to demand that
Duryodhana

comply with the terms of the dice game: Yudhisthira * must be returned his half of the kingdom now that the
Pandavas* have completed their thirteenth year of exile unrecognized. Then Krishna leaves for Dvaraka* with
parting words that are soon invested with meaning. First, underlining his supposed impartiality, he says: "Our
relationship [sambandhakam] to the Kurus and Pandavas* is equal, wishing well to both ... while they are occupied
with each other" (5:5,3). And then, noting that Duryodhana might reject the messenger's entreaties, he urges that in
such a case the Pandavas* should summon him and the other kings as well.
The Pandavas* do not wait for the failure of their first ambassador's mission to begin their search for allies. The
reason is clear from certain words of Drupada's at the Upaplavya meeting: "Duryodhana will now also call
everywhere [for allies]; and approached beforehand, the good partake of the earlier invitation" (purvabhipannah*
santasca* bhajante purvacodakam*; 5:4,9). The obligation to grant the initial request thus takes precedence over
any personal preference for one side or the other.
Krishna himself must be courted, and each side sends its "best." Duryodhana comes to Dvaraka* for the Kauravas,
Arjuna for the Pandavas*. There "they found Krishna sleeping, and approached him [as he was] lying down"
(suptam* dadarsatuh* krsnam* sayanam* copajagmatuh*; 5:7,5). But they do not arrive at the same time or in the
same manner: "As Govinda was sleeping, Suyodhana [a euphemism for Duryodhana] entered [his room] and sat
down on a choice seat toward Krishna's head. And after him entered the highminded Kiritin* [Arjuna]. And he
stood, below Krishna, bowing and joining his hands. And when Varsneya* awoke, first off he saw [dadarsagre*]
Kiritin*" (7,6-8ab). Duryodhana, however, is the first to speak, and his words remind us of those of Krishna at
Upaplavya stressing his "equal relationship" to the Kurus and Pandavas*. "As if with a smile" (prahsanniva),
Duryodhana says to Krishna: "Surely your friendship [sakhyam] is equal for

both myself and Arjuna, just as our relationship [sambandhakam] is equal with you, O Madhava *" (7,10). Letting
Krishna know that he arrived first, Duryodhana also evokes the maxim previously cited by Drupada: the good
(santah*), of whom Krishna is the best in the world (sresthamo* loke), side with those who are the first to come to
them for help (11-12).
Krishna acknowledges these claims, but, he says, although Duryodhana was the first to arrive, "Arjuna was the first
seen by me." Thus assistance must be granted to both, and up to this point everything has reinforced the idea of
parity in the relationship of the two heroes and their parties to Krishna. Here Krishna introduces a note that breaks
the deadlock: "The first choice is to be made by whoever is younger, so it is heard [pravaranam* tu balanam*
purvam* karyamiti* srutih*]; therefore Partha* Dhanamjaya* [Arjuna] is worthy of the first choice" (15). With his
supposed impartiality, Krishna then dictates the terms. The choice will be between a large arbuda of cowherds
(gopas) known as the Narayanas*, "equalling me in strength" (16), or Krishna himself, "alone, not fighting in
battle, my weapons laid down" (ayudhyamanah* samgrame* nyastasastro* 'hamekatah*; 17). With little fanfare,1
Arjuna picks Krishna, and Duryodhana, with the "utmost delight" (paramam* mudam*; 20), accepts the thousands
upon thousands of troops. When Duryodhana has left, Krishna agrees to be Arjuna's charioteer (32-35), and the
two set off to join Yudhisthira* at Upaplavya to continue the "preparations" for war.
This brief but crucial episode presents some intriguing difficulties as well as some striking symbolism. Neither has
captured much attention. Walter Ruben, however, touches upon one difficulty, noting that it is "illogical" that
Duryodhana should try to win over Krishna, as the latter is ever on the Pandavas'* side.2 V. S. Sukthankar
appreciates
1 Except in certain Northern manuscripts, which interpolate a gratuitous glorification of Krishna (41*, after
5:7,19).

the symbolism in terms of his "ethical" and "metaphysical" planes, first seeing the two heroes as a "static
representation" of the Deva-Asura, Pandava-Kaurava * conflicts, and then the full scene as an allegory of the
daivic and asuric elements before the central Self.3 These are all points worthy of further examination.
Ruben is right that there is little "1ogic"at least in human terms, whether emotional or socialin Duryodhana's
appeal. Not only are Krishna's affections for Arjuna and the Pandavas* common knowledge, even to Duryodhana.
Genealogically, Krishna's relation to the Pandavas* is far closer than his relation to the Kurus. His father Vasudeva
is Kunti's* brother, and Arjuna is married to Krishna's sister Subhadra*, making their son Abhimanyu Krishna's
cherished nephew. Yet Krishna mentions his equal disposition toward the two sides.
Excluding preferential and genealogical explanations, then, we should examine the mythological one suggested by
Sukthankar. Here Arjuna, the third member of this threesome, not only agrees with the others about Krishna's
intermediary position but supplies a key to the mythic background. Urging Krishna, before he sets out as the
Pandavas'* next emissary for Hastinapura*, to seek peace there, Arjuna says: "You are the foremost friend
[paramaka suhrt*] of both the Pandavas* and the Kurus, even, O hero, as Prajapati* is among the Devas and
Asuras" (5:76,7). As several authors have shown, a coalescence of Prajapati* with Visnu* is well attested in the
Brahmanas*,4 and this identification is sometimes carried over to Krishna, especially where he is connected with
the sacrifice.5

Prajapati * is not only "impartial" toward the Devas and Asuras as their father;6 his status is more generally one of
kinship to both parties, that which allows Arjuna to imply that he is their mutual "friend" or "family member."7
And just as Arjuna and Duryodhana are in rivalry here for Krishna, so the Devas and Asuras are ever in contention
for the "indivisible" Prajapati*.8
Thus, as Arjuna indicates, the two sets of relationshipsone divine, the other heroicare homologous. But more than
this, the comparison leads to the meaning of the terms by which Krishna determines that the first pick, in the
choice between himself and the Narayana* gopas, goes to Arjuna. It goes to the younger. And it is not simply that
Arjuna, in epic chronology, is a year younger than Duryodhana. This factat least as it shapes the present sceneis
itself a reflection of a mythical paradigm. The Devas are usually the "younger brothers" of the Asuras.9 The epic
scene is thus more than "a static representation" of the Deva-Asura conflict. It is a dynamic one. Duryodhana
comes first, Arjuna comes second, butby a mythically identifiable turnabout, hinging on youthArjuna gets the first
choice.
The passage is a rich one, however, and calls to mind other themes. In particular, the picture of Krishna asleep,
"lying down" (sayanam*) and then waking (the only such scene to

7 Van Buitenen, "The Sabhaparvan*," p. 81, n. 2, says "a suhrd* in the epic is most often a family member";
but sambandhaka, sakhi, and suhrd* all seem to evoke both friendship and family.

9 On this theme in the Brahmanas*, see Lévi, Doctrine du sacrifice, p. 36 and n. 2, citing MS 4,2,1 and TB
2,3,8,1-3; P. 99 and n. 1, citing MS 4,1,2; and p. 43, where he speaks of the Asuras' "right of prior ownership"
in certain matters concerning the sacrifice. Although Lévi says that "the right of seniority is undecided between
the two groups," the majority of passages he cites favor the Asuras. The KB passage cited in opposition simply
lists the beings Prajapati* created in the order Devas, Men, Asuras; they may not have been born in that order.
On the Asuras as elders in the epic, see E. W. Hopkins, Epic Mythology, p. 47, and Held, Ethnological Study,

be included in the Critical Edition) cannot help but remind us of Visnu * Anantasayin*, Visnu*, asleep and
reclining on the serpent Ananta or Sesa*, whose awakening signals the dawn of a new kalpa.10 Krishna himself
tells Arjuna at one point (7:28,25cd-26) that of his four forms (murtis*), the fourth is that which, upon awakening
at the end of a thousand years (mahayugas*?) of sleep, "grants excellent boons to those deserving of boons"
(26cd). This symbolism is open-ended enough to support two epic myths: in one, the goddess Earth comes to
Krishna to request boons for her son Naraka (7:28,27-35); and in the other, Visnu* sees the Danavas* Madhu and
Kaitabha* when he awakens and offers them the "choicest boon" (varam* srestham*), which they foolishly reject
(3:194,8-30). As both concern the offering of boons only to Asuras, and as neither concerns a request for the
service of Krishna or Visnu* in person, they cannot be linked structurally with the epic scene. But the underlying
theme is shared: Arjuna and Duryodhana come before the sleeping Krishna to obtain "boons" when he awakens.
Moreover, Krishna is "awakening" to his longest act of service: assisting the Pandavas* in preparing for, fighting,
and then resolving the effects of the Kuruksetra* war. Indeed, noting the contrast with the comfortably seated
Duryodhana, perhaps one may see in the devotional pose of Arjuna, who stands at the foot of Krishna's bed with
hands joined (krtanjalih*; 5:7,7), a recognition by Krishna's dearest bhakta of the cosmic meaning of his friend's
position.
One crucial theme has so far gone unmentioned in these comparisons. What makes it possible for Krishna to
maintain his stance of impartiality once he learns that Duryodhana had entered his room first, and what makes it
possible for him to set up the choice which will allow him to side with the Pandavas*, is the fact that, upon waking,
"first off he saw Arjuna."

This theme finds a remarkable analogue from a Germanic tradition, the legendary history of the Langobards
(Lombards). From Paulus Diaconus' Historia Langobardorum 1,7-8, which bases its account on an anonymous
seventh-century work called the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, we have the following account.11 First known as
the Winnili, the Langobards settled in a region called Scoringia12 where they were confronted by the Vandals. The
latter, "coercing all the neighboring provinces by war" and "elated by many victories...sent messengers to the
Winnili to tell them that they should either pay tribute to the Vandals or make ready for the struggles of war." With
the approval of their mother Gambara, Ibor and Aio, the two leaders of the Winnili, determined that liberty was
preferable to tribute and sent messengers back to the Vandals with the reply that they would "rather fight than be
slaves." Here Paulus gives us a description of the men on the favored side that accords well with themes in the
Mahabharata *: "The Winnili were then all in the flower of their youth, but they were very few in number."13
Although the present story of youths in migration would seem to imply a uer sacrum ("sacred spring"), we are
reminded of the youth of Arjuna. The matter of inferior numbers could also just as well characterize the Pandavas*
at Kuruksetra* (see, for example, 5:152,23).
Now, with the two sides set for battle, we meet the theme of the waking god:
At this point, the men of old tell a silly story that the Wandals coming to Godan (Wotan) besought him for
victory over the Winnili
11 See William Dudley Fourke, trans., History of the Langobards by Paul the Deacon (Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania, Department of History, 1907), pp. 11-17; cf. H. Munro Chadwick, Heroic Age,
p. 115, and E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and
Winston, 1964), p. 72.

and that he answered that he would give the victory to those whom he saw first at sunrise; that then
Gambara went to Frea (Freja) wife of Godan and asked for victory for the Winnili, and that Frea gave her
counsel that the women of the Winnili should take down their hair and arrange it upon the face like a beard,
and that in the early morning they should be present with their husbands and in like manner station
themselves to be seen by Godan from the quarter in which he had been wont to look through his window
toward the east. And so it was done. And when Godan saw them at sunrise he said: "Who are these long-
beards?" And then Frea induced him to give the victory to those to whom he had given the name. And thus
Godan gave the victory to the Winnili. These things are worthy of laughter and are to be held of no
account. For victory is due, not to the power of men, but it is rather furnished from heaven.14
Such is the account of Paul the Deacon. Certainly the role of Frea and the theme of the false beards find no
analogues in the story of the waking Krishna, but there is a basic similarity in outline. In both stories, before the
battle, each of two opposed sides seeks the boon of ultimate victory from a god who favors the side which he sees,
or will see, first upon waking. Moreover, one cannot help wondering whether, as mentioned above, the youth of
the Langobards might not have something to do with Godan's (Odinn's) attraction for them. Possibly their youth is
to be connected with another theme that, at least according to Paulus,15 has to do with Godan's seeing them first:
their place in the east, the direction of the "young" sun. And the false beards imply either shaving or juniority.
Shapers of Strife
The second confrontation of Krishna with Odinn, or more exactly with a figure whom Odinn impersonates was first
14Ibid., pp. 16-17.
15 In the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, Frea must trick Godan into looking eastward; contrary to Fourke,
however (see ibid., pp. 16-17, n. 1), it seems unlikely that this earlier account shows an original preference of
Godan for "his Wandal worshippers."

presented by Stig Wikander in one of his two articles comparing the events surrounding the battles of Brávellir and
Kuruksetra *.16 His remarks on this momentous comparison are very cautious, as is certainly proper. But perhaps
another look will uncover further evidence that the points in common concerning Krishna and Odinn are well
integrated into these two stories, in which Wikander has discovered so many remarkable parallels.
In both stories, a blind old king leads his forceswhether actually (Haraldus Hyldetan) or nominally (Dhrtarastra*)
against those of his nephews in a great battle which the nephews finally win. In both cases, as Wikander observes,
a god in human form intervenes in the strife and, "with an ambiguous and sly maneuver, secures the victory for the
side he favors. So it is with Odinn at Brávellir and with Krishna at Kuruksetra*." He also says it is "striking that
Harald has the servant Bruno, Odinn disguised, as his driver. This reminds us of Arjuna in the Mahabharata*, who
did not know that his driver was the god Krishna before he revealed himself to him."17
To be sure, the dissimilarities strike one as soon as the similarities are mentioned. Krishna drives the chariot for the
chief hero of the side he favors, serves only as a noncombatant, and, in revealing himself to Arjuna, bestows the
highest divine blessing upon him; Odinn, as Bruno, drives the chariot of the chief figure of the side he opposes,
and, when he reveals himself, clubs the blind old king to death.
16 See above, Chapter 1, n. 87.
17 Wikander, "Från Bråvalla," pp. 184, 189 (my translation, aided by David Goldfrank). The presence of Bruno
and Haraldus on the chariot is, according to Wikander, un-Scandinavian, such vehicles being unused in
warfare; but this, he says, is ambiguous evidence for the provenance of the Scandinavian story: it could at this
point be a poorly understood retelling of the Indian story, or of a story ultimately from India, where Krishna
appears on his chariot with Arjuna; or it could be a reminiscence of a genuine epic tradition from an older
cultural stage.

No such fate befalls Dhrtarastra *. But a closer look at Bruno will keep us from easily dismissing the possibility of
some connection with Krishna. Just after telling us that Haraldus has transferred one of his nephews, Olo (prince-
regent of Norway), to the service of his other nephew and eventual chief rival Ringo (prince-regent of Sweden),
Saxo describes the machinations of Bruno:
At this time one Bruno was the sole partner and confidant of all Haraldus' councils. To this man both
Haraldus and Ringo, whenever they needed a secret messenger, used to entrust their commissions. This
degree of intimacy he obtained because he had been reared and fostered with them. But Bruno, amid the
toils of his constant journeys to and fro, was drowned in a certain river; and Odinn, disguised under his
name and looks, shook the close union of the kings by his treacherous embassage; and he sowed strife so
guilefully that he engendered in men, who were bound by friendship and blood, a bitter mutual hate, which
seemed unappeasable except by war.18
Krishna, of course, does not have to kindle the strife between the Kurus and Pandavas*, but as early as the
Rajasuya* sacrifice, and certainly after the dice game, we see him fanning it. The parallels are most striking,
however, in the Udyogaparvan, where Krishna, like Bruno, is an ambassador between the two parties, the last to
have the ear of both, and a figure of whom "treachery" and "guile" would hardly be unrealistic charges.19 The
position of intermediary is in both cases made possible by a special "intimacy": Bruno reared and fostered
apparently with both Ringo and Haraldus, Krishna bearing an "equal relationship" to both parties. Different
theologies may also account for the different modes of impersonation: Krishna the lifelong avatara*, Odinn, in
what looks like either a much attenuated story or Saxo's monkish sleight-of-hand,

Society, 1905), II, 468-69.

the double of a figure who has drowned. Most curiously, while the name Krishna means "Black," Bruno would
seem to mean "Brown."20 One can only speculate on what if any connection these two dark colors might have; to
be sure, there are no "three Brunos" to parallel the Mahabharata's * "three Krsnas*."
A final parallel is the apparent divine shaping of both crises and their resolution. It is, according to Saxo, Odinn
"whose oracle was thought to have been the cause of his [Haraldus'] birth,"21 and, after Odinn helps Haraldus to
consolidate his kingdom and gains his confidence as the ambassador Bruno, it is by Odinn-Bruno's hand that he
dies. In the Marabharata*, things are more complicated, but the underlying motivation is similar. Dhrtarastra's*
father is not Krishna, but Vyasa*. Yet Vyasa* is in fact a second Krsna*, Krishna*, a Dvaipayana*, and, like
Krishna Vasudeva*, an incarnation of Visnu-Narayana*. Thus Odinn, only partly through Bruno, shapes the career
of Haraldus from birth to death, and Visnu-Narayana*, only partly through Krishna, shapes that of Dhrtarastra*
from birth to defeat. In each case, the intrusive, deformed element which the god has helped to create and sustain
is finally overcome, and the renewal of order is achieved by the triumph of the blind king's nephews.
20The Oxford English Dictionary, for "brown" gives the etymology OE brún, OFris brûn, ON brún-n (Sw
brun, Da brunn), OTeut *brûn-o-z, *brûn-â; H. S. Falk and Alf Torp, Norwegisch Dänisches
Etymologisches Wörterbuch (Oslo and Bergen: Universitetsforlaget, 1960), p. 107, shows that brun
("brown") has the root meaning of "bright, shining," as "of a color which looks like something burnt." Cf.
Fr. brunir, Eng. burnish. It is thus possible that Bruno could mean "Shining"; but it seems unlikely the root
meaning by itself would have supplied the hero with his name.
21 Elton, Danish History, p. 456; on this oracle, see Wikander, "Från Bråvalla," p. 188: the "pilgrimage" of
Haraldus' father to the oracle at Uppsala to cure his wife's sterility is uncharacteristic of Scandinavian religion
but typical of Indian. But Wikander argues that this need not be taken as an indication that the story is
borrowed from India, as Saxo could have placed a Christian pilgrim image anachronistically in heathen time.

These two confrontations of Krishna-Visnu * with Odinn which will not be the only ones to engage usare curious
from several angles. Both concern interventions by these gods in human, that is, epic-heroic, affairs. More
specifically, they involve interventions at the beginnings, and, at Kuruksetra* and Brávellir, also at the conclusions,
of great, if not the greatest, heroic battles in their respective traditions. We thus find Krishna's activities before the
war doubly elucidated by comparisons with Germanic legends. But his role as the Pandavas'* ambassador must be
investigated further by additional Indo-European comparisons, ones concerning not only legends but rituals.

Chapter 6
Two Theophanies, Three Steps
Nowhere is Krishna more conspicuous than in the Udyogaparvan, the "Book of Preparations," making speeches,
representing the Pandavas * on his embassage to Hastinapura*, and catalyzing the conditions that build up to the
inevitable clash at Kuruksetra*. But the "preparations" for war actually culminate not in the Udyogaparvan but the
Bhismaparvan*, where Krishna, Arjuna, and Yudhisthira*1 complete their readiness for battle. In the case of
Arjuna and Krishna, this final "preparation" is, of course, the Bhagavad Gita*. Thus, in following this segment of
the epic through its natural course, I will focus not only on dramatic themes that concern Krishna in the

Arjuna's Vision: Observer at the Pralaya
In her remarkable study of the Hindu myth of the pralaya,2 Madeleine Biardeau has provided a new perspective on
the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita*, in which Krishna reveals to Arjuna the visvarupadarsana*, the sight
of his universal form. The celebrated theophany, which most scholars, perhaps judiciously, have left to explain
itself, is now appreciated within a ritual context. As Biardeau observes, the textin particular verses 15-33, which
concern Arjuna's description of the vision

(15-31) and Krishna's explanation of its meaning (32-33)is one of two used in the ritual of entry into samnyasa *,
the life of renunciation.3 It must suffice here to summarize: one who performs this ceremony symbolically
renounces the three sacrificial fires and the three samsaric* worlds and enters into the enlarged universe in which
there are four additional worlds4 beyond those of the ordinary person, there to find himself in the company of the
Devas and Pitrs*, "all of these, like himself, being admitted to deliverance at the moment of the cosmic pralaya."5
The choice of Gita* 11,15-33 to be recited at this juncture is full of significance: "It recalls to the samnyasin* the
cosmicand terribledimension of the god of deliverance, as if henceforth the perspective of a purely individual
deliverance was forbidden him and was bound to a cosmic catastrophe."6 For, as Biardeau demonstrates, the Gita*
theophany itself depicts such cataclysm: "The vision which Arjuna has is near to that which an observer of the
pralaya would have were he situated beyond it."7
Others, of course, have noticed that several points of Arjuna's description call upon images of the end of the
kalpa.8 And
3 Biardeau brushes aside the question of when the Gita* passage was put to this ritual use; as she points
out, the Gita* does not seem to know the seven worlds (probably a later, Puranic* formulation) upon which
the ritual depends for its cosmology; EMH, 3, P. 54, n. 1; cf. Hopkins, Epic Mythology,k p. 60.

Walter Ruben has appreciated the mythic character of the theophany as a whole in his otherwise artificial
comparison of Krishna, revealing himself as all-devouring Time (Kala *), with Chronos-Kronos, "Time"
swallowing up his own children.9 More precise points have led Biardeau to observe the correlations between the
pralaya myth and the Gita* theophany. Puranic* descriptions of the pralaya distinguish two classes of beings:
those who have not escaped rebirth and the law of karman, and who are absorbed, after the great "fire of time," by
the "one ocean" into which the three worlds dissolve; and those who have been delivered to oscillate between the
four higher worlds on the way to final release.10 Out of the "single ocean," through the awakening of Visnu-
Narayana* who lies upon it, the first group will re-emerge in the next kalpa as part of the substance of the new
creation; but the delivered are free to witness and experience the transformations of the cosmos in the timeless and
blessed company of the most sublime divine actorsVisnu*, Siva*, and Brahma* (or either of the first two, or the
goddess, in their all-inclusive identities).
Now Arjuna, in witnessing Krishna's theophany,11 is for a moment placed at this latter vantage point by Krishna's
grace. I cite the most pertinent verses, dividing them according to the order in which Arjuna sees (1) the fate of the
delivered, (2) the fate of the nondelivered, and (3) the fate of the (three)
9 Ruben, Krishna, pp. 221-22.
l0 EMH, 3, PP. 19-37; Vayu* Purana* 1, 7, 18-19ab gives the most complete list of the delivered: Devas,
Pitrs*, Munis, Manus, and Suras ("gods" as juxtaposed with Asuras); EMH, 3, PP. 19-20 (text and translation)
and 34 (discussion).
11 Experiencing the pralaya is a sort of absolute revelation: see the Markandeya* myth (Mbh. 3:186, 56-78,
and Heinrich Zimmer, Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization [New York: Harper, 1962], pp. 35-
53), and EMH, 3, P. 57, where Biardeau discusses the absolute experience of those who live through the
prakrtapralaya*, the end of a life (not just a day) of Brahma*.

Filling with radiance the whole universe,
Thy terrible splendours burn, O Visnu *!13 [29-30]14
One could make further precisions and qualifications on the comparison: the enumeration of the delivered is much
more generous (even including Asuras!) than in any Puranic* list (see above, n. 9); Arjuna's vision is gained not
from any ulterior worlds (see above, n. 2) but from a battlefield in this one; and Arjuna is not a samnyasin* but a
prince, whom Krishna teaches that karmayoga is superior to samnyasa* (Gita* 5,2).15 But the main fact stands: it
is as lord of the pralayaitself a theme which he weaves into many of the Gita's* teachings16that Krishna reveals
himself to Arjuna.
One need not insist on the importance of this chapter in the structure of the Gita*. Here, as a final capping of
Krishna's arguments, which have already dispelled Arjuna's delusion (11, 1), Arjuna is turned back toward his
ksatriya* dharma; and
13 I assume that in identifying Krishna and Visnu*, the Gita* is revealing one if its essential "teachings"
and not just some accident of historyKrishnaism incorporating Visnuism*, or vice versa. Too many
scholars have allowed their search for separate origins to obscure the all-important significance of this
relationship; on this verse and verse 24, where Arjuna also calls Krishna "Visnu*," see, for example, the
labored efforts of Hill, Bhagavadgita*, p. 33, to keep them apart: "He [Krishna] is called Visnu* ... in
contexts where Arjuna may well have been reminded of the sun."
14 Here and elsewhere (unless otherwise noted) I quote from Franklin Edgerton, trans., The Bhagavad Gita*
Translated and Interpreted, Harvard Oriental Series, XXXVIII and XXXIX (2 vols.; Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1956), XXXVIII. Again, one cannot insist on more than three worlds for the Gita* (see
above, n. 3); the pralaya teaching would seem to have been able to develop around this core.
15 But this question is much more complex, as samnyasa* and yoga form a unity in the Gita*; see EMH, 3,
PP. 61-67.
16 See Gita* 7, 5-14 (in connection with the image of the universe "strung on me like heaps of pearls on a
string"); 8, 15-28 (in connection with the devayana* and pitryana*); 9, 5-10 (on prakrti* at the pralaya); 14,2
(on devotees of Krishna being undisturbed by sarga or pralaya); 14, 15-16 (in connection with the gunas*); cf.
16, 11, and see Etienne Lamotte, Notes sur la Bhagavadgita* (Paris: Guethner, 1929), p. 67, for brief
discussion.

one may observe that once this chapter is over, Arjuna's questions no longer have dramatic value: he is
"convinced" and is merely asking for clarification on points of doctrine.17 Moreover, this is one of the two points
in the Gita * where Krishna reveals to Arjuna something of his divine purpose and the significance of his part in
the Mahabharata* war. The first is Krishna's famous identification of his activity with the avatara* doctrine and
the yuga structure (4,8cd): "To make a firm footing for the right [dharma], I come into being in age after age
[yuge-yuge]."18 But now, seemingly going to a deeper level of his identity, he discloses that his activities are
linked with the kalpa structure and the destructive side of Time.19 With the vision still before him, Arjuna asks for
an explanation; Krishna replies: "I am Time [Death], cause of the destruction of the worlds, matured / And set out
to gather in the worlds here. / Even without thee (thy action) all shall cease to exist, / The warriors that are drawn
up in the opposing ranks" (11,32).
It is against this second background, then, and immediately (11,32-33 and 51 ), that Arjuna comes to understand
his duty to fight. Not only does he see himself as Krishna's friend and ally in the intrayuga struggle between
dharma and adharma; at a deeper level,20 as Krishna's bhaktafor it is only "by
17 See Gita* 12,1; 14,21; 17,21; and 18,1; with his interest in dramatic continuity, Rudolf Otto, The
Original Gita*, J. E. Turner, trans. (London: Allen and Unwin, 1939), regards everything from 11,51 to
18,58 as interpolation.
18 It is a futile argument that because the term avatara* is not used here that the doctrine or the identification
with Visnu* (see above, n. 13) is not implied.
19 On the importance of recognizing the distinctness of yuga and kalpa, see EMH, 1, pp. 22-23, and EMH, 3,
PP. 37 and 65, n. l, 66, n. 5. In particular, Biardeau observes that while the yuga cycles have to do with the rise
and fall of dharma, the kalpa cycle occurs irrespective of dharma.
20 Note that Otto, Original Gita*, p. 136, regards 11,33 as "the principal verse of the Gita* the carama sloka*
since it is solely from them that Krsna's* conversation with Arjuna receives its real meaning"; but he rejects
4,7-8 from the "original Gita*."

unswerving devotion" (11,54) that this vision is manifestedhe now sees himself as a "mere instrument"
(nimittamatram *; 11,34) in the awesome process, totally without struggle and beyond dharma and adharma (see
above, n. 19), by which Krishna-Visnu*, as Time, brings the worlds to ripeness and "gathers them in." Yet this
double perspective completes Arjuna's instruction: he learns the secret that, with regard to the central teachings of
the performance of duty and the desirelessness of man's activity, the end of the yuga and the end of the kalpa must
be as one. To participate in Krishna's universe is to be his "friend and devotee" (4,3; see 11,44), that is, both to
uphold dharma and to seek moksa*.
The Theophany in the Kuru Court
Biardeau's insights allow us to appreciate that it is not just one chapter, but the whole Gita*, which presupposes
such a significant cosmology. But more than this, we have been led to speak of the Gita*theophany and allas an
integral part of the Mahabharata*21 And it so happens that this is not Krishna's first theophany in the epic, but his
second:22 a fact which could hardly have been insignificant in the eyes of the Mahabharata's* poets, but which
has escaped the notice or mention of seeingly
21 On the Gita's* place in the epic, see, most recently, and rather inadequately, Georg von Simson, "Die
Einschaltung der Bhagavadgita* im Bhismaparvan* des Mahabharata*," IIJ, XI (1969), 159, nn. 1 and 2,
actually citing only those who more or less agree with him that it is an interpolation. For counteropinions,
see S. Lévi, "Tato Jayam Udirayet," L. G. Khare, trans., ABORI, I ( 1918-1919), 13-20; V. S. Sukthankar,
Mahabharata*, p. 119; Otto, Original Gita*, pp. l1-14; Dumézil, ME, I, 221, 93, 34; Zaehner, Bhagavad-
Gita*, pp. 6-7; and Biardeau, EMH, 3, P. 61, n. 1. K. T. Telang, trans., The Bhagavadgita*, SBE, VIII (
1882; repr. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1970), P. 5, registers "a feeling of painful diffidence regarding the
soundness of any conclusion whatsoever."
22 One other epic theophany (14:54,3-7), supposedly redisclosing the Gita* form (there called
rupamaisvaram*; 3) to the desert sage Uttanka*, yields no pralaya imagery and holds no important narrative
links with the other theophanies.

all the Gita's * critics but one.23 His name is famous: Rudolf Otto. Although I cannot share his views on an
"original Gita*," we may note with admiration how two facets of his approach have borne fruit. First, not
surprisingly, he has been guided by what we would call the Gita's* theology rather than its philosophy; and
second, surprising to me, he has insisted that the Gita* must be understood within its narrative context. He says
that the Gita* theophany is "a quite obvious parallel to the Theophany in which Krsna* has already revealed
himself to Duryodhana," and he insists that "these subtle parallels and contrasts of sublime epic construction
cannot and must not be ignored."24 I will return to his exposition of these relationships, but first let us familiarize
ourselves with the new scene.
As Otto says, it is just "a short time before" the battlefield scene of the Gita* that the first theophany occurs.25
Krishna has come to Hastinapura* as the last of a series of three emissaries who have gone between the two sides
to perform acts of prewar diplomacy. He represents the Pandavas* before the Kurus with a series of pro forma
exhortations to peace and compromise, and these are backed upsince there is no real possibility that they will be
accepted by Duryodhanawith lists of grievances, exchanges of insults, and threats of war. But Krishna's words are
persuasive, so much so that Duhsasana*, Duryodhana's foremost brother, is pressed to say that if Duryodhana does
not accede, "assuredly, having bound you, the Kauravas will deliver you over to the son of Kunti* [Yudhisthira*]"
(5:126,22). Upon hearing these words, Duryodhana makes a memorable gesture: "sighing like a great snake" (126,
24), he rises from his seat in anger and quits the assembly, followed by his brothers and the assembled kings
(whose silence earlier had shown deference to Duryodhana although "they
23 Quite possibly someone has been overlooked, but generally Gita* criticism has been preoccupied with
other problems.

applauded Krishna with their hearts" [5:93,62]). Krishna's persuasiveness, then, has no effect on Duryodhana other
than to press him into an act of disrespect, for his defiant exit is an insult to Krishna and the various Kuru elders
who remain behind.
Along with the exit, which Krishna will respond to in kind, the scene confronts us with another theme that builds
now to a powerful climax. Earlier (5:86,12-15), Duryodhana had publicly expressed his intention to restrain and
bind Krishna upon the latter's arrival at Hastinapura *; but Dhrtarastra* and Bhisma* had denounced him. Now,
with negotiations completely broken down, each side turns to this device as a last resort. First, with Duryodhana
and his supporters absent from the court, Krishna urges the Kuru elders to do exactly what Duhsasana* had feared
(126,33-49): abandon Duryodhana, he says, as the Yadavas* did Kamsa*, and bind himwith his closest
confederatesover to the Pandavas* as Varuna*, the lord of Waters, bound the Daityas and Danavas* in the ocean
with his nooses and with those of Dharma (tanbaddhva* dharmapasaisca* svaisca* pasairjalesvarah* varunah*;
46). These words provoke neither comment nor action. Rather, Duryodhana is summoned back to court to hear one
more appeal from his mother Gandhari*, and when he walks out again, disregarding her words, he meets secretly
with Karna*, Duhsasana*, and Sakuni*. Suspecting that Krishna and Bhisma* will try to seize them, Duryodhana
once againbut this time covertlyplans with his allies to seize Krishna and thus destroy the hopes of the Pandavas*
(128,4-8). Yet even as they state their resolution, one senses their apprehension of the difficulty of seizing the
"quick-acting" (ksiprakarin*; used twice: 128,4 and 8) Krishna.
At this point, rather strangely, it is not Krishna but his kinsman Satyaki*"skilled in interpreting signs" (ingitajna*;
128, 9)who intuits the plan. He sees to it that Krishna's troops are alerted and then enters the court to warn him.
There are some hurried deliberations in which Krishna says

he would not object should Duryodhana try to seize him, as this censurable and futile act would only benefit the
Pandavas * (128,24-29). At this, Dhrtarastra* calls his son back one last time, together with his fellow conspirators
and the kings (33)-Amidst the final pleas for reconciliation, a restrained but charming expression of bhakti is
evoked from Dhrtarastra*, once again taking us to a "deeper level" of insight into what is going on: "Like the wind,
difficult to seize with the hand, like the moon (or the rabbit), hard to touch with the hand, like the earth, hard to
bear on the head, Krishna is difficult to seize by force" (128,39).26 But Duryodhana cannot be dissuaded. The
impasse is complete, and the scene is set for Krishna's first theophany in the Mahgbhgrata*.
Possessing energy [viryavan*], Krishna addressed Duryodhana: "Alone am I [eko 'hamiti]. That is how you
regard me, O Suyodhana, from delusion [mohat*]. And surrounding me, O weak minded one, you wish to
seize me. Yet here are all the Pandavas*, as also the Andhakas and Vrsnis*. Here are the Adityas*, Rudras,
and Vasus, together with the Maharsis*." Saying this Kesava*, that slayer of hostile heroes, laughed loudly.
And while the high-souled Saurin* was smiling, the thirty [the gods]having forms of lighting, of the size of
a thumb, flashing like fire [vidyudrupa* ... angusthamatras* ... pavakarcisah*]were released [mumucur
(Ganguli-Roy trans.:" from the body")]. Situated on his forehead was Brahma*, and Rudra was on his
breast. The World Regents were on his [four] arms, and Agni [Fire] was produced from his mouth, as also
the Adityas*, Sadhyas*, Vasus, Asvins*, the Maruts together with Indra, and the Visvedevas*. And such
also became the forms of the Yaksas*, Gandharvas, and Raksasas*. So from his two forearms were
manifested Samkarsana* and Dhanamjaya*Arjuna on the right with his bow, Rama* [Balarama*] on the
left with his plow. Behind him were Bhima*, Yudhisthira*, and the two sons of Madri*, and the Andhakas,
Vrsnis*, Pradyumna and others of prominence were in front of Krishna, their great weapons upraised.

And on Krishna's various arms were seen the conch, the discus, the mace, the dart [? sakti *], the bow
Sarnga*, the plow, and the sword, all upraised and ready for striking, blazing on all sides. And from his
eyes, nose, ears, and from all sides were manifested highly terrible [maharaudrah*] sparks of fire mixed
with smoke, and also [sparks] like the sun's rays in the pores of his skin. And beholding this dreadful self
[ghoramatmanam*] of the high-souled Kesava*, the kings shut their eyes, their hearts trembling, but not
Drona*, Bhisma*, and the highly intelligent Vidura, and the highly favored Samjaya*, and the Rsis*
possessed of wealth of tapas, to whom the Lord [bhagavan*] Janardana* gave divine sight. And beholding
that very surprising [appearance] of Madhava* in the court, celestial drums sounded and a rain of flowers
fell; the whole earth trembled and the ocean was agitated, and the inhabitants of the earth [or the kings
(parthivah*)] became deeply perplexed. [129,1c-15]
Krishna then withdraws this form (vapus), which is referred to as "variegated" (citra-) and "auspicious"
(rddhimat-*, literally: "possessing growth or increase"), and walks outrighteously where Duryodhana had just left
unrighteouslywith his kinsmen Satyaki* and Krtavarman* ( 16-17).
Such is the theophany in which Rudolf Otto saw "subtle parallels and contrasts of sublime epic construction" with
the theophany of the Bhagavad Gita*. But when we turn to his The Original Gita*, we find little indication of what
he has in mind. Krishna "disarms the miscreant" in one instance and obtains obedience to his "supreme divine
decree" in the other; both Duryodhana and Arjuna are "victims of anxiety": the former "about the issue of the
contest," the latter "about the sacred laws of piety"; Duryodhana is "unmasked," Arjuna is "accepted as a tool for
the exalted deeds of God, although he is at the same time humbled because of his 'wilfulness.'" These "parallels
and contrasts" do not, of course, have much to do with the epic's narrative structure. Rather, the oppositions that
preoccupy Otto concern the psychological states of the two heroes, what he several times refers to as their "specific
situation." And it soon becomes apparent that in confining himself to parallels of this type, Otto is allowing his
notion of an

"original Gita *" to color his comparison of the theophanies. His "original" is pared of Samkhya*, Yoga, Vedanta*,
and Bhakti doctrines to reveal "Krishna's own voice and deed" by which he renders Arjuna "willing to undertake
the special service of the Almighty will of God Who decides the fate of battles."27 We need only point out that
from the perspective opened up by Biardeau, the "fate of battles" is a trivial issue indeed.
There is, then, a sort of "Here I stand" quality to the manner in which the Lutheran scholar sees Arjuna and
Duryodhana face to face with God, submitting to, or being submitted to, his will.28 Not surprisingly, he sees the
multiform aspects of the Gita* theophany as "expressions of the numinously terrible, not speculative symbols of
Universal Unity." Even if we agree with this as it is phrased, we realize that Otto fails to see any importance in the
symbols themselves and in what the principal figures represent. My earlier expression of admiration should now be
qualified. Otto is guided by the Gita's* theology, but it is a theology relieved of its cosmology (which Otto never
discusses) and its symbols (which Otto is satisfied to explain by their numinousness). And although Otto insists on
the significance of the narrative context of the two theophanies, Arjuna and Duryodhana are important to him only
as recipients of revelations (presumably historical) by God. He is only barely interested in them as figures in a
wider epic drama and not interested inalthough apparently recognizingthe nature of this drama, at least on one
level, as "myth."29
More commentary on the two theophanies may be added. First, with regard to narrative context, there is another

to the war, in which Arjuna and Duryodhana are juxtaposed to one another in their relationship to Krishna: the
scene at the waking Krishna's bedside.30 Krishna's "equal relationship" to the two invites a search for meaningful
contrasts in the narrative implications of the two divine self-disclosures. On some points, it seems we are rewarded.
In the court theophany, Krishna's ostensible purpose is to make peace, whereas in the battlefield theophany it is to
make war. More than this, the first theophany takes place in a scene which has built up to the point where the
deluded Duryodhana regards Krishna to be "alone," whereas the second occurs in the very midst of the battlefield,
between the two drawn-up armies, where Arjuna has had Krishna take him so that he can view the assembled hosts
which comprise in their ranks representatives of "all" the peoples of the world. And yet, when he appears to be
alone, his manifestation is public (appreciated by all who do not close their eyes), whereas when he is in the midst
of many, his revelation is private, reserved for his "friend and devotee."
These oppositions, however, begin to make sense only within the context of Hindu cosmology, with its symbols
and structures. Here Biardeau's comments on the Gita * help us to extend Otto's rather narrow conception of the
parallels and contrasts between the two theophanies. In brief, when Krishna appears alone, he produces or
"releases" all classes of beings (except Asuras)31 from his own person; and when he appears at the very center of
all beings, he dissolves them into himself. If Arjuna is close to being "an observer of the pralaya," Duryodhanaor
more accurately the elders and Rsis* to whom Krishna gives "divine sight"is witness to a sort of creation. In the
one case, Krishna shows his dissolving "dreadful form" (ugrarupam*: Gita* 11,31); in the othereven though the
kings see it only as his
30 See above, beginning of Chapter 5.
31 Possibly the poets view the production of Asuras as a redundancy, since the Asuras are already present,
incarnated in the assembled kings.

"dreadful self" (ghoramatmanam *) and close their eyeshis form is "variegated and auspicious [or increasing]." In
this connection, a comment by Zaehner takes on added significance: when Arjuna concludes his description in the
Gita* and asks Krishna to explain this ugrarupam*, his words, in Zaehner's translation, are: "Fain would I know
you as you are in the beginning" (vijnatum* icchami* bhavantam adyam*>; 11,31 ). As Zaehner comments:
"Arjuna does not yet understand the terrible side of his nature displayed by Krishna. . .. Nothing in Krishna's
teaching had prepared him for this. He would sooner know Him 'as he is in the beginning', in his eternal rest, rather
than his incomprehensible and seemingly savage activity."32 The opposition thus seems to be implied within the
Gita* itself, in Arjuna's uncertain response. What the epic poets have done, then, is give us two contrastingor at
least partially contrastingvisions of Krishna's form and modes of action. Or, to use an Indian terminology, the poets
have used the device of presenting the divine nature from the standpoint of different darsanas*, a device used with
considerable frequency in connection with other subjects in the epic,33 and one which has required in this case that
we suspend the question of which theophany might be the older (certainly it is not a question of an "original") in
order to examine them for the light they shed on each other.
However, although we can speak of meaningful contrasts on the levels of Indian theology and cosmology, we see
that it is not simply a neat, sequential juxtaposition of cosmogony (sarga

raid, and, in a similar vein, the many "views" on Drona's death expressed at the end of the Dronaparvan* (see
below, Chapter 10); our general point should be set beside a memorable remark of van Buitenen's ("The
Sabhaparvan*," p. 79): "The epic is a series of precisely stated problems imprecisely and therefore
inconclusively resolved, every inconclusive solution raising a new problem; until the very end, when the
question remains: whose is heaven and whose is hell?"

or pratisarga) followed by pralaya. As we said, the court theophany is only a sort of creation. The narrative
context, the modes of revelation, and the symbols involved in the description are in no way direct reminders of any
Hindu creation myth, although in matters of mode and symbol it seems quite likely that the poets have kept the
Purusa * Sukta* in the backs of their minds.34 Thus, although the two theophanies offer "perspectives"
(darsanas*) on Krishna's creative and destructive aspects, his all-out-of-one and his all-into-one dimensions, they
do so without presenting them as a complete diptych. The court theophany seems to hint at something else, which
would never have come to light were it not for a brief but important article by Dumézil.
Krishna and the "Three Steps"
Dumézil has explored the Indo-European myths and legends which show parallels with the ritual roles and
practices of a college of Roman priests, the fetials, who were formally responsible for making peace and declaring
war.35 Their duties would take them as envoys or ambassadors in rituals of diplomacy into lands of "foreigners"
and especially of enemies and could entail the making of treaties,36 the presentation of demands
34 For example, the general theme of the emergence of beings from the god's person, and more particularly
the connection in both "theophanies" of Agni with the mouth. In an interpolation made in one Devanagari*
text, the description continues after sloka* 11 (CE 5,495*) with mention of Krishna's thousand feet, arms,
and eyes, and the sun and moon standing in his eyes; see Otto's trans., Original Gita*, p. 152). The text
read along with the Gita* theophany in the samnyasa*-entry ritual (see above, n. 3) is the Purusa* Sukta*
(EMH, 3, 52-53)the use in this ritual perhaps signifying a reflection on the two modes of divine action in
creation and destruction.

for reparation of wrongs and thus, if these were not met, preparation for a "just" war,37 and also
pseudonegotiations of considerable duplicity.38 The key passage for our purposes is one from Livy concerning the
procedure followed by the Pater Patratus, the fetial who would go to another city to demand justice on behalf of the
Romans:
When the envoy [legatus] has arrived at the frontiers of the people from whom satisfaction is sought, he
covers his head with a bonnetthe covering is of wooland says: "Hear, Jupiter; hear, ye boundaries
of"naming whatever nation they belong to;"let righteousness hear [audiat fas]! I am the public herald of the
Roman people; I come duly and religiously commissioned [iuste pieque legatus venio]; let my words be
credited." Then he recites his demands, after which he takes Jupiter to witness: "If I demand unduly and
against religion that these men and these things be surrendered to me, let me never enjoy my native land."
These words he rehearses when he crosses the boundary line, the same to what man soever first meets him,
the same when he enters the city gates, the same when he has come into the market place [forum], with
only a few changes in the form and wording of the oath. If those whom he demands are not surrendered, at
the end of three and thirty daysfor such is the conventional numberhe declares war. [1,32,6-8 (B. O. Foster,
trans., Loeb Classical Library, 1919); cf. Dionysius of Halicarnassus 2,72,6-9]
As Dumézil shows, in these four stops for invocations, the Pater Patratus marks out three zones in this "foreign
world."39
There is ample documentation of Indo-European parallels to get us from Rome to India, and, as Dumézil says, it is
not a matter of finding other examples of similarly specialized

38 In a letter of January 5, 1969, which first alerted me to his study and to the possibility of this comparison,
Dumézil refers to the negotiations after the episode of the Caudine Forks (Livy 9. 10, 7-10) as "the extreme
case" of "the complicity of the fetialis and the Roman general." See also Dumézil, Archaic Roman Religion,

priests ("the Indian priest is multivalent, omnivalent"), but of appreciating similar scenarios in myths and
legends.40 This does not mean making comparisons with other ambassador figures, although such an investigation
might prove interesting.41 Rather, the important common theme is that of stepping forth, usually with three strides,
into or through uncharted or enemy territory so as to establish a just or religious base or foundation.42 there and to
open up (one might say sacralize) the space necessary for conquest by war. Two other instances are the Iranian
Rashnu who provides Mithra with the space necessary for his exploits and who takes part in opening the way for
righteous souls to ascend through the three regions of Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds;43 and the
strange Irish figure Amairgen, hero of the last race to occupy Ireland, whose first right-footed step on the island is
given special textual emphasis and whose approachon his initial prewar missionto the island's capital is thrice
arrested, each time by one of the queens of the land.44 Both of the figures just cited have been compared with

Wave, etc." (see Macalister, Lebor Gabála, pp. 110-13),

who has given the three strides their renown. First, in the Rg * Veda, Visnu's* three steps create for Indra "the vast
field which will be the theatre of their victory" over Vrtra*.46 The cosmogonic overtones of this scenario have
impressed F. B. J. Kuiper,47 but from the comparative perspective, it looks as if this Vedic "opening of the
cosmos" is but a variant of the wider and highly multivalent theme of the opening of alien or hostile space.
Second, from the Brahmanas* to the Puranas*, it is after entering the realm of the Asuras that Visnu*, in his Dwarf
(Vamana*) form, enlarges himself so as to step through the three worlds and restore them to the gods.48
There are important structural differences between the two Indian myths. The Vamana* takes his three steps not
into the enemy territory, as in other Indo-European scenarios, but, having already entered it, from within it
outward. By the same token, the Dwarf, by his three steps, does not open the way for Indra to conquer the worlds,
but conquers them himself.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
with Krishna's description of his "supernal manifestations" (vibhutis*" in Gita* 10,20-42). However,
whereas Amairgen describes his forms when he steps on land, at the start of his initial nonmartial compaign
into the island, Krishna describes his after the nonmartial mission into Kuru-land, at the beginning of the
war. In a wider framework another unsettling parallel emerges: in the series of five races that occupy
Ireland, Amairgen's theophany occurs at the beginning of the last; in the series of four yugas, Krishna's also
occurs at the start of the last, both coming at the juncture between "pre- history" and "modern times."

establishing the nonsolar character of the three steps (p. 141) and in insisting on the "central" character of the
Vedic Visnu* (p. 144), a position analogous to that of the epic Krishna (pp. 145 and 150).

Furthermore, the theme in the Vamana * myth concerning the restoration of territory to the gods differs from that
of the opening of new territory which, as (still) seen in the Vedic "cosmogony," is most comparable to other Indo-
European examples. It is worth keeping these contrasts in mind, for as we return to the epic Krishna, we find an
intrigue that corresponds to the Vedic and Indo-European patterns in each instance but the last. First, however, let
us note that Dumézil has invited the comparison: "In the Mahabharata*, Krishna is the incarnation and the epic
transposition of Visnu*. . . ; his role as an ambassador, a veritable fetial, on the eve of the war, throughout the
whole fifth book (Udyogaparvan), ought to be considered in the light of this present study."49 No doubt Dumézil
has precise points in mind, some of which, one hopes, will correspond with those offered here. In any case, let us
now look more closely at Krishna's ambassadorship and the events surrounding his court theophany.
Krishna is the last of three emissaries to seek peace between the Kurus and the Pandavas*, but he does not really
expect peace. As he explains to Yudhisthira* (5:71,25-34), he will go to the Kuru court to remove "the doubt of all
men" (sarvalokasya. . . samsayam*; 26) by praising Yudhisthira's* virtues and denouncing Duryodhana's
transgressions, thus persuading not only the assembled kings but also the people of town and country, the young
and the old, and the four varnas* (29); although he sees no virtue (dharma) in suing for peace, he can represent
Yudhisthira's* desire for it while observing the inclinations and proceedings of the foes (32-33), all the while
expecting war with them (sarvatha* yuddhamevahamasamsami* paraih* saha; 34). He departs after a morning
ritual (81,9-10), taking Satyaki* (81,22) along with ten maharathas*, "great chariot warriors," and thousands of
troops (82,1-2). Aside from the portents which accompany his movementswherever he goes

there are gentle breezes and auspicious signs while everywhere else are disasters (82,4-12)the poets are interested
in a ritual concern, the matter of hospitality. Krishna first makes his way to Vrkasthala * (82,20), one of the five
towns demanded by Yudhisthira* (see below, note 54), and there spends the night. Hearing that he has set out,
Dhrtarastra* orders that sumptuous pavilions or halls (sabhas*) be built to receive him there, and the task is carried
out by Duryodhana (83,9-17). But Krishna sidesteps the entrapment that accepting these honors would bring, "not
having even looked at [asamiksyaiva*] all those diversely bejeweled pavilions" (83,18). Dhrtarastra* then plans a
second time to honor Krishna upon his arrival at Hastinapura* by preparing a gala reception for him in the city and
in his own palace and readying for him Duhsasana's* mansion, the most splendid of all (85,19-21); instead, after a
public welcome and a mere exchange of courtesies at Dhrtarastra's* home, Krishna takes up residence
unostentatiously at the home of Vidura (87,52).50 Then, after a visit to Duryodhana's mansion, Krishna refuses his
hospitality: having been offered cows, honey, and then palaces and the kingship (88,9),51 as well as food (11), he
again accepts hospitality only from Vidura, pending the success of his mission.
Several things stand out among these three refusals to accept favors at three different stages in his journey. First,
this is the only instance where the stages of one of Krishna's journeys are marked; elsewhere, as Ruben has noted,
the poets allow him to cover vast distances without the blink of an eye.52 Moreover, we see similarities to the
approaches of some of the other
50Krishna's allegiance to virtue seems to be suggested here, as Vidura incarnates a portion of Dharma.

52 Ruben, Krishna, p. 282; for Ruben, the failure to account for Krishna's manner of covering vast distances
suggests that the epic has intermingled two originally independent story cycles.

figures we have discussed. First, noting what is similar in the three stops, just as Krishna must not be swayed by
the offerings of palaces and other items of wealth, the Irish Amairgen must not be swayed by the three queens of
the island. Quite possibly these are two variationswealth and sexof temptations by use of the third function. And
noting what is different at each stage, we see similarities between Krishna's three stops and those of the Pater
Patratus once the latter is past the boundaries of Rome: while Krishna stops at a town (the first?), the fetial stops to
address the first man he meets; both then make their entrances into the foe's city; and while Krishna enters
Duryodhana's court (where his dealings are with kings), the fetial comes to the forum or market place (where his
dealings are with a people).
There is, however, more to link Krishna's gradual advance and successive refusals with the theme of the three
steps. The text, by a strange recurrence at each of the last two stops, suggests as much itself. Having entered
Dhrtarastra's * palace (just after arriving in the city), Krishna "stepped over [or crossed] three enclosures" (tisrah*
kaksya* vyatikramya; 87,12a); and again, entering Duryodhana's palace, he "stepped over three enclosures
unimpeded by gatemen" (tasya kaksya* vyatikramya tisro dvahsthairavaritah*; 89,2cd). In all of Krishna's
comings and goings, only on one other occasion does he follow this procedure of crossing three enclosures
(tvaritya* ... tisrah* kaksya*; 2:19,28ab). Here too he is entering the residence of a rival of Yudhisthira* for world
sovereignty, King Jarasamdha* of Magadha, although in this case Krishna is accompanied by Arjuna and Bhima*,
and their mission lacks even the pretense of peace making or diplomacy. Kaksya* can refer either to an enclosure
inside a palace (a court or chamber) or outside (a wall); apparently the word has been used in the two
Udyogaparvan instances first in the former sense and then in the latter. Most important, the passages in question
seem to present, by their double employ of the words tisro vyatikramya, "having stepped

over three," a clear double reminder of Visnu * Trivikrama, Visnu* of the Three Steps.53
The Third Step and the First Theophany
So far, then, Krishna's actions recall those of the Pater Patratus (and suggest those of Amairgen as well) both in
terms of motive and procedure. With regard to Visnu*, in two of the three cases cited earlier where there are
structural discontinuities between the Vedic three steps and his three steps as the Dwarf, Krishna's mission recalls
the former. Krishna steps into the Kuru territory rather than from within it outward. He opens the spaceof which
Duryodhana will not yield so much as is covered by the point of a needle54for the Pandavas* to conquer in a just
war rather than conquering it himself. One may thus suggest that the transposition has Vedic and parao-Vedic roots
traceable to Indo-European themes.
The third discontinuity between the two myths of the three steps points to parallels with the Vamana* myth:
Krishna does not open up a new territory for the Pandavas*; rather, as does Vamana* for the Devas, he helps
restore to them what was formerly theirs. Here it is an Indian, and perhaps post-Vedic, mythic theme that provides
the model for the epic struggle: the cyclical round of reversals and triumphs that marks the conflict between the
Devas and Asuras. In a fashion similar to this, not only do the Pandavas* and the Kurus reverse their
53 Dumézil, "Les Pas de Krsna* et l'exploit d'Arjuna," OS, V (1956), 183-88, sees Visnu's* three steps
transposed into the epic scenes where Krishna takes three "initiatives" (twice stepping forth from Arjuna's
chariot) to inspire Arjuna against Bhisma*. I think it is quite possible to have two transpositions of this
multivalent theme. This other case, however, is the more fictionalized of the two and the further removed
from a significant parallel context.
54 Krishna demands half the kingdom back for the Pandavas*, or at least five towns, but Duryodhana says that
while he lives, the Pandavas* shall not have so much of "our land" (bhumernah*) as might be procured by the
sharp point of a needle (5: 125,26).

fortunes in the dice game and the great battle on earth, butin the Svargaparvanin heaven and hell as well.55
Correspondences also occur between the Vamana * myth and the mission of Krishna in certain matters of detail.
First, there is the theme of the bound demon. From epic texts on, the Asuras in the Vamana* myth are championed
by one figure, usually King Bali, and as early as the Mahabharata* there is reference to what in Puranic* texts is
clearly the result of Bali's encounter with Visnu* the Dwarf. Indra, on a tour of the domain which the Dwarf had
presumably won for (or returned to) himwe are told that Bali was formerly a sovereign but is now divested of
"prosperity"finds Bali in a cave by the seashore (12:220,22) "bound with Varuna* nooses" (baddhasca* varunaih*
pasair*; 220,18). This theme, which one finds in Scandinavia in connection with Loki, and which is well known
elsewhere,56 seems to appear in India only in connection with Bali. Thus Namuci (12:219,3) and Prahlada*
(12:215,8) are bound in the set of scenes just cited where Indra encounters Bali and other past sovereigns; and, in a
sort of inversion, it is Bali's son Bana* who has Krishna's grandson Aniruddha bound, thus precipitating a great war
between the forces of Krishna and Siva*.57 In the main narrative of the epic, the theme occurs only once, in the
passage, or series of passages, that we have discussed: amidst plans and counterplans, Krishna urges that
Duryodhana be bound over to the Pandavas* as the demons had been bound with the nooses of Dharma and
Varuna*. The fact that neither Krishna nor Duryodhana is actually bound is a small matter. The epic restructures
mythic themes in accord with

its own pace and to suit its own ends. The allusion itself, especially from Krishna's own mouth, is transparent.
The second point, however, is the more crucial: the matter of the theophany itself. For if the wide strides of the
Vedic god imply a great manifestation, it is only when he grows from the stature of a dwarf to that of a being who
encompasses the three worlds that the nature of this manifestation as an expansion becomes explicit. Moreover, in
what must be regarded as one of the earlier tellings of the myth even though it occurs only in the Northern
recension of the Mahabharata * (Aranyakaparvan*, Appendix I, No. 27, lines 64-82), it is said that after the Dwarf
reveals his "divine, marvelous form" (line 78),58 "the gods thereby became manifest and the universe was called
Vaisnava*" (tena devah* pradurasanvaisnavam* cocyate jagat; line 82,). These are both prominent features in the
court theophany of Krishna. Having entered seemingly alone, he "expands" so as to become "everything"a
procedure which now seems to be reflected in the description of his theophany as rddhimat*, "possessing growth
or increase." And out of his person not only do the gods "become manifest," but human heroes as well, his own
kinsmen and the Pandavas*a theme which one may relate to the description of the theophany as citra,
"variegated."
The Vamana* myth thus shows how closely, in the case of Krishna, the theme of binding is linked to the
theophany. If Krishna cannot "expand" from the form of a dwarf, he can expand from a position where, as the
foolish Duryodhana sees it, he appears alone and capable of being constricted. Indeed, the connection is implied in
the words, cited earlier, of Dhrtarastra*: "Like the wind, difficult to seize with the hand, like the moon, hard to
touch with the hand, like the earth, hard to bear on the head,59 Krishna is difficult to seize by force."
58 In some Puranic* texts, it is called his Visvarupa*; see Tripathi, Vamana-Legende*, pp. 80 and 239.
59 It is tempting to compare this with the tradition that with his third step, Visnu* steps on Bali's head, but this
does not appear earlier than in the Bhagavata* Purana*.

The Vamana * myth thus clarifies Krishna's court theophany by its combination of these themes, but there is a
larger integration still possible if one takes up Dumezil's* hint and looks at Krishna as a "veritable fetial." Let us
recall the maneuvers that brought the Pater Patratus to the point where we left him: having approached the non-
Roman territory in three stages and repeated his demands for satisfaction of wrongs, he waited thirty-three days
and then declared war. Now Livy continues:
. . . he declares war thus: "Hear Jupiter, and thou Janus Quirinus, and hear all ye heavenly gods, and ye,
gods of earth, and ye, of the lower world; I call you to witness that this people"naming whatever people it
is"is unjust [iniustum], does not make just reparation. But of these matters we will take counsel of the
elders in our country, how we may obtain our right [ius nostrum]." Then the messenger returns to Rome.60
One could note further similarities in the Pater Patratus' deliberations, upon his return, with the rex and Senators,
and in those of Krishna, upon his return, with Yudhisthira* and his allies. Both concern the fact that war can now
be waged which, in Livy's terms, is "just and righteous" (puro pioque).61 In any case, the scenario is now
complete: in Rome, a priest takes the "three steps" and represents all the gods62 by invoking them. In India, the
ambiguous, omnivalent, and in some respects not unpriestly63 figure of Krishna takes the "three steps"
60Livy 1. 32, 9-10; Dionysius of Halicarnassus (2.72, 8) shortens this but retains the essential: "He called
both the celestial and infernal gods to witness and went away."
61Livy 1. 32, 12; cf. Mbh. 5: 149,41, where Krishna, summarizing his efforts to Yudhisthira*, says that by
trying to make peace, his and the Pandavas'* debt to dharma is gone, satisfied (dharmasya gatamanrnyam*).
62 From what I can tell, it is unusual that the Roman gods are all invoked like this, but this matter requires
further study.
63 Already we have seen in Chapter 4, where he protects the Rajasuya*, that Krishna is connected with the
sacrifice (see especially Chapter 4, n. 29); he is also preceded in his role of ambassador by Drupada's purohita,
"chaplain" (5:20-21), and, in the upcoming "sacrifice of battle," it is said that he will be the adhvaryu, the main
administrating priest (5: 139,29).

and represents all the gods by being them. One need not search far for the differences in theology that would
sustain such different modes of divine representation. In one case, it is the specialist priest who on the strength of
invocation can channel the totality of divine power to the service of Rome; in the other, it is Visnu * immanent in
human form as well as in the universe who, through his capacity to manifest his own divinity, can reveal how the
totality of divine power is maintained at the service of the Pandavas*, of dharma, and of the three worlds.
Krishna's two theophanies thus not only relate to each other, but to the theme of the three steps. The first theophany
seems to be an Indian reinterpretation of an archaic gesture, Indo-Roman insofar as it concerns a mode of giving
divine sanction to war at the moment when the ambassador realizes its inevitability, and probably, taking into
account the one step, three stops, and theophany (see above, n. 45) of the Irish Amairgen, Indo-European. The
second theophany, however, even though juxtaposed with the first in several significant ways, calls to mind not
Indo-European or even Vedic themes, but rather what are usually thought of, despite their frequency in the epic, as
Puranic* ones. These considerations should allow us to reflect on a few matters concerning the Mahabharata* and
two of its most prominent contemporary critics. First, even though the Gita* evokes the more recent mythology
and cosmology, I have tried to suggest by examining the two theophanies together that the Gita* should be seen as
a coherent part of the epic, not simply as one of its "didactic" portions. Second, by drawing from both ancient and
recent myths, I have tried to show how the epic narrative itself has been structured in part to bridge the gap
between Vedic and Puranic* mythologies, conserving the former (and conserving pre-Vedic themes as well) and
embracing it within the new "universe of bhakti"64 of the great gods of epic and Puranic* Hinduism.

Finally, one facet of what some have condescendingly called the "leisurely pace" of the Mahabharata * is its
device of presenting countless darsanas*, perspectives, on the drama that forms its core. I have tried to suggest
here, although in Part Three I will steer a middle course between them, that the Indo-European perspective of
Dumézil and the Puranic*, one might say "Hindu," perspective of Biardeau are both valid, and that, to borrow from
a Samkhya* similitude, they may at some points be as necessary to each other, in making a way through the
Mahabharata* forest, as the blind man and the lame.

Chapter 7
Sri *and the Source of Sovereignty
Having followed Krishna through his prewar appearances, we come now to the great battle between the Kurus and
the Pandavas* in which he helps the latter attain the "sovereignty of the world." Before we take up Krishna's
involvement in the actual battle scenes, we must learn what is meant by "sovereignty." Indian mythology in
general, and the Mahabharata* in particular, associate sovereignty with the goddess Sri-Laksmi*,1 a figure whose
importance for understanding Krishna is nicely summarized by the Pandavas*, who at one point say to their cousin
and counselor: "Surely you are not a leader of those on whom Laksmi* has turned away her face" (2:18,10; na hi
tvamagratastesam* yesam* laksmih* paranmukhi*).
Much has been written about Sri,2 but a number of issues deserve further attention. First is the question of origins.
Both Gonda and Jaiswal agree that she is a "pre-Aryan fertility goddess";3 in contrast, although some connection
with fertility
1 Although Jaiswal, Origin and Development, pp. 88-89, tries to show separate origins for their names and
identities, I am not convinced this has much significance, at least for the Mahabharata*.
2 Disagreement over the original meaning of the word sri* is found between Hermann Oldenberg, "Die
vedischen Worte für 'schön' und 'Schönheit' und das vedische Schönheitsgefuhl," NKGWG, pp. 35ff. ("beauty"),
and Jan Gonda, Early Visnuism*, pp. 178-81 and 204-7 ("prosperity"). Both Gonda, pp. 212-31, and Jaiswal,
Origin and Development, pp. 89-109, provide useful accounts of the development of her iconography,
mythology, and ritual. For further bibliography, see below.

is never under dispute, her connection with kingship has prompted Alexander H. Krappe to include her among a
number of Indo-European goddesses and heroines who bestow royal fortune.4 Second, the question must be raised
whether Sri * has a coherent mythology of her own, perhaps quite ancient, or whether her mythology is always to
be reduced to patterns established by other goddesses, be they connected with fertility or some other "feminine"
resource. And third, how do these matters bear on Sri's* epic incarnation as Krsna-Draupadi*
Sri's* Transpositions
It has long been argued that Sri's* affiliations with Visnu* are not her earliest. According to Hopkins, "It is a late
epic trait to make her exclusively Visnu's* (she is also Dharma's wife)."5 Jaiswal insists that Sri's* position as
Visnu's* consort "is the latest feature of her legends in the Mahabharata*,"6 their union having been achieved at
"the beginning of the Gupta period" (320 A.D).7 Gonda concurs: "This stage is not reached before the younger
parts of the Mahabharata*."8
The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata* reveals that some of the recent redactors of the epic probably saw Sri's*
different affiliations as something of an embarrassment. In one of the so-called "dictionaries of incarnations"9
which enumerate the demonic and divine origins of long lists of epic characters, the closing verses tell about some
of the women. First mentioned

are the sixteen thousand Apsarases who took birth as Krishna's harem (1:61,93-94). Then comes a sloka * that at a
certain point was altered.10 Originally, as the reconstituted Critical text has it (61,95):
A portion [bhaga*] of Sri* became incarnate, on the earth's surface,
in Drupada's family, a faultless maiden from the center of the sacrificial altar [vedi*].
Between the two lines an amendment was inserted to read as follows:
A portion of Sri* became incarnate, on the earth's surface, in the family of Bhismaka*, in the person of the
chaste Rukmini*.
The faultless Draupadi*, however, was born from a portion of Saci* in Drupada's family. . .. [566*]
The interpolation thus makes Draupadi*, "endowed with every mark [laksana*] . . . [and] a charmer of the hearts
of five Indras among men" (purusendra-*; 61,97), a portion of Indra's wife Saci*, and thereby allows Visnu's*
incarnation Krishna to find his partner in an incarnation of Sri*.
The identifications of Sri* with Rukmini* and of Draupadi* with Saci* probably are recent, although this does not
mean that the association of Sri* with Visnu* is equally late. What one finds on the mythic or theological level
need not be duplicated exactly on the epic level. As I tried to show in Chapters 3 and 4, Draupadi's* actions are
often ambiguous; seemingly, they point to a double affiliation on the mythic level of Sri* with both Visnu* and
Indra. But such ambiguities have gone unappreciated by those who see only a late connection of Sri* with Visnu*
and, correspondingly, an early relation between Draupadi* and Saci*.11
10 The interpolation occurs in several scripts, including all but one in Devanagari*.
11 Biardeau seems to want it both ways: although the interpolated verse is "supplementary," it makes little
difference whom Draupadi* incarnates, "for, in her function as Indra's wife, Saci* also participates in the nature
of Sri*" (my translation); "Brahmanes* et potiers," p. 40. This solves little.

In writing Mythe et épopée, I, Dumézil did not rely consistently on the Critical Edition; this helps to explain his
acceptance of the authenticity of the interpolated passage along with its identifications.12 The alternative, he says,
would cause a "discordance which a western mind would easily turn into vaudeville, since Visnu * is actually
incarnated in . . . Krishna, and the encounters between Krishna, Draupadi*, and the latter's five husbands are very
frequent.13 The "oriental mind," except in interpolations like the one just mentioned, has handled this differently,
as shown by a passage from the Anusasanaparvan*. The speaker is Sri*, addressing Rukmini* herself:
In my embodied form [sarirabhuta*], single-heartedly [ekamana*], I dwell with my entire spirit [sarvena*
bhavena*] in Narayana*; surely in him is dharma penetrated to the fullest, piety [brahmanyata*], and also
agreeableness [priyatvam*]. Might I not explain here, O Lady [devi], that I do not dwell [elsewhere] in my
embodied form [naham* sarirena* vasami*]. But in that person [especially kings, for example, the
Pandavas*] in whom I dwell in spirit [bhavena*], he increases in dharma, fame [yasas*], artha, and kama*.
[13:11,19-20]
The passage, from this inflated parvan, may be "late" by epic standards, and it does not explicitly link the
"spiritual" form with Sri's* "portion" Draupadi*. But it does indicate an attentiveness of the epic poets to different
modes of activity on different levels, in particular what we might differentiate here as the theological or mythical
and the heroic or "human."
For Dumézil, however, in the "original" transposition the overlap between the theological and epic levels must
have been exact,14 and he buttresses his view by an elaborate reconstruc-

tion of the transposition into three phases.15 In brief, he argues that the original figure behind Draupadi * was a
variety of the Indo-Iranian goddessArmaiti, Anahita*, Sarasvati*, Vac* who complements the male gods or
Entities concerned with the three functions in a relation similar to that between Draupadi* and her five husbands.
Drawing from his interpretation of a myth from the Markandeya* Purana* (which will be discussed below) and on
the interpolated passage just cited, he proposes that the first goddess connected with Draupadi* to have this
trifunctional theology superimposed upon her was Indra's own wife, Saci* or Indrani*. Then, "intermediary"
between the theological and epic "causalities," Dumézil sees a myth concerning Sri* (the myth of the five former
Indras16) and a "romanesque" (fictionalized) legend as being more or less fabricated by the poets to justify the
polyandric marriage in narrative form.17
My inclination is to take the epic as seriously as possible in its linking of Sir* with Draupadi*. But Dumézil will
only allow that, as a "choice" of a figure on whom to superimpose the theology of the Indo-Iranian trivalent
goddess, the poets got by all right with Sri*, as she "is not badly adapted to the situation," being also the subject of
old speculations connected with the three functions.18 I believe, however, that from the moment of her literary
debut in the Brahmanas*,19 there are significant differences in the ways that Sir* and the Indo-Iranian trivalent
goddesses interact with the functions. A closer examination of Sri* herself is needed: her theology, her myths, her
symbols and settings.

constitute the earliest text eulogizing Sri* and date, according to Scheftelowitz, "Srisukta*," p. 41, from the
Brahmana* period.

Sri * and the Three Functions
A good starting point is a most interesting passage referred to by Dumézil: Satapatha* Brahmana* 13,2,6,1 -7.20
The text, from the long thirteenth kanda* on the performance of the royal horse sacrifice (Asvamedha*), finds the
horse back from his eleven months of wandering and facing his last trip, the one to the sacrificial stake. At this
point (following Dumézil's summary) three queens, in descending order of dignity, make three successive unctions
on parts of the horse's body, which thus assure the king, in succession, of tejas ("spiritual force" or "majesty"),
indriyam ("physical force"), and pasu* (cattle)the latter "having more social importance than 'beauty' in the third
function.21 But there is something more.22 The Asvamedha* itself involves risks to the sacrificer. During his year-
long diksa* in the horse's absence, the king has been abandoned by "the sacrifice," that is, by the horse (13,2,6,2).
For the time of this absence, the three qualities just mentioned and one other also leave the king: "Indeed, fiery
mettle [tejas] and energy [indri-yam], cattle [pasu*] and prosperity [sri*] depart from him who offers the
Asvamedha*" (3).23 When the three queens confer the three virtues on the horse (4-6), these qualities may return
to the king. It would seem that the queens have acted as repositories for them during the absence of the horse, or of
"the sacrifice." And the queens are themselves identified with the fourth quality mentioned in the stanza just cited:
"It is the wives that anoint (the horse), for theyto wit, (many) wivesare a form
20 Dumézil, ME, I, 118; ME, II, 35:2.
21 Dumézil, ME, I, 118 (my translation). The English equivalents for these "qualities" or "virtues" are always
problematic. Tejas in particular varies according to context. Fuller attention to these terms will be given in
Chapter 8.
22 Dumézil takes note of the added term himself in Archaic Roman Religion, p. 225.
23 Here and elsewhere, I follow the translation of Julius Eggeling, trans. and ed., Satapatha* Brahmana*,
SBE, XII, XXVI, XLI, XLIII, and XLIV (1882-1900; repr. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1966).

of prosperity [or: a form (rupam *) of Sri*]: it is thus prosperity he [the horse] confers on him (the sacrificer), and
neither tejas, nor indriyarn, nor cattle, nor sir* pass away from him" (7).24
A debate over capital or lower-case letters for sri* should be discouraged: the two meanings would by this time
have been interchangeable. The important point is that the trifunctional virtues are part of a wider drama. Briefly,
(1) Sri* is connected with royalty; (2) she is specifically concerned with a formulation of royal virtues; (3) her
"trivalence" does not lie so much in incorporating these virtues (her "forms" or representatives, the queens, are by
no means saintly or strong) as in being able to confer them, actually transfer them (through the sacrificial horse to
the king); and (4) sir* or Sri* may be said to "follow" the virtues, to be an additional and special member. Not
only do the three "trifunctional" virtues abandon and return to the king, but so does Sri*: "Indeed, that glory (sri*),
royal power, passes away from him who performs the Asvamedha*" (SB* 13,1,9,1); and, just like the other virtues,
returnsbeing "the top of royal power" (13,2,9,7).
Let us examine each of these points in turn to see if they hold up where the concept sri*, or figure of Sri*, appears
elsewhere in the Brahmanas*.
(1) These early ritual texts include the claim that a sovereign is wedded to Sri*.25 In a modification of the new and
full moon sacrifices (the daksayana*; SB* 2,4,4,1ff.), apparently worked out for a royal family called the
Daksyanas*,26 the sacrificerlike Prajapati* who, desiring praja* ("progeny"), sacrificed to obtain Prosperity (sir*;
stanza 1)obtains "generative power and prosperity" (prajati*, sri*; 4). In fact, having performed this sacrifice,
"thereby Sri* is (wedded) to him without a rival and undisturbed" (6). This no doubt implies that either his wives

the previous passage) or his kingdom (rastram *) itself27 is an embodiment of Sri*.
(2) As to her preoccupation, specifically, with royal virtues,28 the Brahmanas* again present further information.
The Mitravinda* sacrifice (SB* 11,4,3,1ff.), in which the sacrificer "finds Mitra" (stanza 20) who is here connected
with ksatram* ("nobility," probably royal power), has its mythological setting in an account of the birth of Sri*.
Born from the austerities of Prajapati*,29 the gods "set their minds on her" (stanza 1). Then, in a strange
momentthe gods are usually, as in the case of Usas* or Vac* (see n. 29), more inclined to protect their sisters from
their father's incestuous designs30the gods desire to kill her and dispossess her of her qualities. Prajapati* stops
them, however, by letting them know that one can take from a woman while leaving her alive! So the gods each
claim an appropriate share: "Agni then took her food, Soma her royal power [rajyam*], Varuna* her universal
sovereignty [samrajyam*], Mitra her noble rank [ksatram*], Indra her power [balam], Brhaspati* her holy lustre
[brahmavarcasam], Savitr* her kingdom [rastram*], Pusan* her fortune [bhaga], Sarasvati* her plentifulness
[pusti*], and Tvastr* her forms or manifestations [rupani*]" (stanza 3). Thus despoiled, she complains to
Prajapati*, who tells her: "Do thou ask it back from them by sacrifice" (4). She then makes a distinct offering to
each god (5), and they all appear before her. Reciting their names forward and backward (6-7), and then

invoking them one at a time (8-17), she implores them for the return of her qualities.
Clearly the virtues involved include those that are royal, even though the declared purpose of the sacrifice is to
"find Mitra." The list of ten deities and ten qualities would appear resistant to trifunctional analysis, but when the
ritual orientation of the Brahmana * text is considered, several concordances with typical trifunctional lists suggest
themselves.31 Agni and Soma, connected with the sacrifice, fall easily into place as additions superimposed on the
first level.32 Brhaspati's* position next to Indra probably reflects the ancient Vedic pairing of these two
divinities33 and the predictable priestly concern that Indra not stand alone.34 In fact, a similar principle is found in
certain trifunctional passages which place brahmavarcasam, "brahmic" or "holy luster," alongside second-function
virtues. Thus, according to Satapatha* Brahmana* 11,4,4,11: "If he [the sacrificer] think, 'There has been that
which was disconnected in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That makes for my prosperity [sri*]; Prosperity,
surrounded by splendor [tejas], fame [yasas*], and holy lustre [brahmavarcasam], will accrue to me." And, in a
passage (TS 7,1,8,2) where the goddess Sraddha*, "Faith" or "Confidence," plays much the same role for a rsi* as
Sri* does for a king: "Atri had Sraddha* for divinity [sraddhadeva*]. When sacrificing, the four vigors [catvari*
viryani*] did not come to him: spiritual force [tejas], physical force [indriyam], holy lustre
31 Cf. RV* 10,125,1-3, where Vac*, referring to herself as the "queen" (rastri*), announces that she
"sustains" (bibharmi) not only the "canonical" deities (see below, n. 34), but Agni, Soma, Tvstr*, Pusan*,
and Bhaga.
32 Cf. the place of Agni and Soma in SB* 1,6,3,15, discussed below.

Kulturgeschichte (Weisbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1968); Charles Drekmeier, Kingship and Community in Early
India (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1962), pp. 26-43.
34 Again, see RV* 10,125,1, the famous verse where Vac* says: "I sustain Varuna* and Mitra, Indra and Agni,
and the pair of Asvins*."

[brahmavarcasam], and proper food [annadyam *]." Then, presumably with the support of his "Confidence" in the
sacrifice, Atri sings a four-part hymn to Soma and obtains the "vigors." Finally on the level of the third function,
where the goddess Sarasvati* maintains a logical rapport with "plentifulness," the proliferation of additional
deitiesSavitr*, Pusan*, Tvastr*also finds a partial explanation in the Brahmana* literature. Satapatha* Brahmana*
7,2,2,12, citing Vajasaneyi-Samhita* 12,72, adds Pusan* directly to the five "canonical" gods (see n. 34), just as
Sri's* "forms," which Tvastr* appropriates, usually range themselves in the province of the third function.35
Savitr*, for his part, bestows gifts. It is interesting that all the deities connected here with the third function are
(excepting Sarasvati*) Adityas*, unlike the unincluded Asvins*. Sri*, it seems, will concern herself only with the
most sovereign deities (the Adityas*) and with the deities connected with the sacrifice (Agni, Soma [who is also
termed Raja*], and Brhaspati*) in accord with the Brahmanas'* sacrificial orientation.
It is quite likely, then, that Sri*, in a different way from the "trivalent" goddesses Sarasvati* or Vac*, does bear a
close relationship to deities who represent the three functions. One difference can be attributed to the ritualism of
the Brahmana* texts, but the second is directly connected to the specific gift which Sri* bestows: royalty. Adityas*
replace the Asvins*.36 So, too, the Asvins'* epic sonsNakula and Sahadevawill "actually" be Indras. Yet it is not
so much the different divinities that hold the tripartite structure together in its relation to Sri* as the virtues with
which these gods are connected. Here the trifunctional meanings are transparent enough on the third (forms,
plentifulness, good fortune, kingdom [that is, subjects] and
35 In the present passage, good "forms" in cattle are referred to (stanza 17); see above on royal wives as a
"form" of Sri*.
36 Cf. Mbh. 12:217,41: Bali tells Indra, referring to his former sovereignty and relation with Sri*: "Singly I
bore the energies [tejamsi*] of all twelve of the illustrious Adityas*."

second (power) levels. The first level contains surprises. But in relation to Sri's * concern with royalty, it is
significant for the Brahmana* literature that Mitra be associated with ksatram* rather than Indra and that Varuna*
represent the universal sovereignty (samrajyam*), which Sri* may than bestow. On this level it appears most
clearly, especially considering Soma's association with rajyam*, that Sri*in contrast to the trivalent
goddessesconcerns herself specifically with virtues of royalty.
(3) The third pointthat Sri's* trivalence does not so much lie in incorporating the virtues as in conferring or
transferring themwould seem to be endangered by the myth just cited. To be sure, the gods take these qualities
from Sri* (their first impulse is to do so by killing her, surely implying some notion that she "incorporates" them);
and to Sri* they restore them. But there is never a question of her putting the virtues into effect on her own,
whether to defend or to regain them. Rather, she wins everything back by sacrifice and formula. Sri* is then a
repository for those virtues specifically connected with sovereignty which, in accord with the general outlook of the
Brahmanas*, can be conferred or transferred, through the medium of the sacrifice, to othershere to "the gods,"
elsewhere, as we have seen, to a king, to Sri's* choice.37 Thus, where she does incorporate an assortment of
virtues, they are important not as a measure of her own stature but as a complement to the virtues of her royal
counterpart(s). On this account, then, her relation to the three functions stands in marked contrast to the trivalence
of the Indo-Iranian goddesses discussed by Dumézil, for instance Aredvi Sura* Anahita* ("The Humid, the Strong,
the Immaculate") or Sarasvati* who, along with her third-function affiliations, is also called vrtraghni* ("[female]
Slayer of Vrtra*";
37 A devotionalized form of this tendency occurs in Sriukta* 10, part of this text's "early" portion (see
above, n. 19), where one prays that Sri* may bestow various virtues: "May we attain our heart's wish and
intention and truth of speech [vacas* satyam]; may Sri* allot me the form of cattle and of food [pasunam*
rupam* annasya] as well as fame [yasas*]."

RV * 6:61,7) and dhinam* avitri* ("auxiliary of pious thoughts"; RV* 6:61,4).38
(4) Finally comes the manner in which sri*, as a virtue or a goddess, follows after the other virtues. Actually, the
Asvamedha* passage cited at the beginning of this section is the best Brahmana* illustration, but there is an
interesting passage (referred to in n. 32), in which sri* rounds out the other qualities. Let us also note the
significant context. After Indra slew the divine artisan Tvastr's* tricephalic son Visvarupa* (SB* 1,6,3,2), Tvastr*
sought revenge by creating Indra's arch foe Vrtra*. The latter was born from the combination of Soma poured into
the fire (Agni) and "came to be possessed of Agni and Soma, of all sciences [vidyas*], all glory [yasas*], all
nourishment [annadyam*], all prosperity [sri*; 8]." Indra then cajoled Agni and Soma into coming over to him
(13), and "after them went forth all the gods (devas*), all the sciences, all yasas*, all nourishment, all sri*: thus...
Indra became what Indra now is" (15).
This myth bears certain resemblances to the much more clearly structured myth of Markandeya* Purana* 5, which
Dumézil finds so satisfying and which I will discuss below. There again Indra's virtues are bound up with his
conquests of Visvarupa* and Vrtra* and his accession to world sovereignty. The virtues in the Puranic* myth are
unmistakably trifunctional, and here too such an interpretation can be proposedwith prosperity and nourishment on
the third level, yasas* (fame or glory) on the second, and devas* and vidyas* on the first. The two latter terms
present the only stumbling blocks, but it seems that the authors have aligned devas*, the Devasin particular Agni
and Soma (stanza 8)with the sacrificial ordering of the cosmos and vidyas* with the principles of the "scientific"
ordering of the sacrifice itself. Whereas in the Markandeya* myth, Indra, after the restoration of his virtues, is
joined by his "great wife" (Saci*, Sri* see below), here the last of the virtues to come to him is his

sri *. However, the pattern of Sri*, as a goddess, following the other virtues will have its clearest expressions in the
Mahabharata*.
Thus, despite Sri's* connection with trifunctional groups of virtues and her importance to kings, the Brahmanas*
give us no royal mythology to connect these two concerns. In the epic, the myth most frequently used to show
Sri's* involvement with the virtues and with kings has Brahmana* antecedents. But in the Brahmanas*, the myth is
told about other goddesses than Sri*: Apas*, Bhumi*,39 Daksina*,40 Vedi* (TS 6,2,7-8), and above all Vac*. The
latter, whose capacity to make "choices" is already recognized in the Rg* Veda,41 is, in the Brahmanas*, a much
sought-after figure who must frequently choose between two classes of beings. In their earliest form, the conflicts
in these stories are probably most consistently represented in the Indo-Iranian opposition between the Devas and
Asuras, an opposition which echoes through the Brahmanas* no less than the epics and Puranas*. Vac* is one of a
vast number of blessings (usually female) that the gods must win over from their adversaries, and several
Satapatha* Brahmana* passages tell how she comes over to the gods (whether by fair means or foul).42 The
common theme is that the goddess' chosen ones, inevitably the Devas, have triumphed on a winner-take-all basis.
To make matters as simple as possible, I will follow the hints of Gösta Johnsen and Dumézil43 and refer to this
scenario as the "Svayamvara* mythologem," for just as in the Svayamvara*?,
39 See Gösta Johnsen, "Varuna* and Dhrtarastra*," [I], IX (1965-1966), 225, n. 47, mentioning the

dressed wife to her husband."

at least in its name,44 the emphasis is on a feminine figure, goddess rather than heroine, "choosing" her partner (or
partners)45 amidst a wooing contest. It is this mythologem that the epic poets found of the widest use in accounting
for the relationship between the two concerns of the Brahmanic * Sri*: her interests in virtues and in kings.
Sri* and Her Choices
In the Mahabharata*, the most concentrated assemblage of myths connected with Sri* is found in the
Santiparvan*. A good deal of the material in this open-ended book is probably fairly late by epic standards, but
there are reasons to suspect that the myths concerning Sri* contain old themes and material. As Dumézil says of
one of them,46 they were probably not invented by the epic poets.
The first account is structured according to the familiar theme of the virtues and the next (which actually comprises
four accounts) is held together mainly by the theme of Sri's* inconstancy. This latter motif is not connected with
Sri* in the Brahmanas*, but as it develops it is not unrelated to the theme of the virtues.
(1) Advised by the divine chaplain Brhaspati* that the only way he can gain world sovereignty from the Daitya-
Asura Prahlada* is to go to him disguised as a brahmin, become his
44 Jean Przyluski, "Le Prologue-cadre des Mille et une nuits et le thème du svayamvara*," JA, CCV
(1924), 109-10, and Marie Delcourt, "The Legend of Sarpedon and the Saga of the Archer," HRJ, II (1962),
40, are of the opinion that the Svayamvara* has nothing of "self-choice" but the name. There is, however, a
tradition that Draupadi* does "choose," at least negatively, when she refuses to accept Karna* as a suitor.
The CE has valid grounds for rejecting this passage (see 1:178,17 and 1827*), but it accords well with other
passages concerning Draupadi* and Karna*.
45 In the Brahmanas*, Vac* goes over to the Devas, not to Indra in particular; but probably he is the chief
beneficiary. In the epic, Sri*, like Draupadi*, chooses just one husband: Indra or Arjuna; but in each case, the
beneficiaries are not only these two, but the gods in general or the Pandavas*. As to her relations with the
Asuras, see the following section.

disciple, and ask for his behavior (sila *; 12:124,42), Indra carries out-these instructions to the letter. Honor bound
to grant all wishes of brahmins, the virtuous Prahlada* reluctantly agrees to part with this most precious
commodity. "And while he was thinking,...an embodied energy [tejas], having the form of a shadow, abandoned
his body. Prahlada* asked that great form, 'Who are you?' It answered, 'Surely I am [your] behavior [sila*];
abandoned by you I am leaving. I will dwell blamelessly, O king, in that best of brahmins [Indra]" (12:124,45-
47ab). "Behavior's" departure is followed by the exodus of other virtues, each one explaining to Prahlada* that it
must go after its predecessor. Thus, coming after (1) sila* are: (2) dharma (also called a tejas), (3) satya, "truth"
("blazing up with tejas"), (4) vrttam*, "activity," and (5) balam, "strength." Last but not least:
A goddess made of effulgence [prabhamayi* devi*] came out from his body. The chief[indra] of the
Daityas asked her [who she was]. So she said, "Sri* I dwelt happily, O hero, in you who are truly mighty
[tvayi satyaparakrame*].47 Abandoned by you, I will leave ...."
Then the fear of the high-souled Prahlada* became visible, and he asked her besides: "Where are you
going, O Lotus Dweller? Surely you are a goddess devoted to truth, the supreme goddess of the world.
Who is that best of brahmins? I wish to know the truth."
Sri* said, "This brahmacarin* who was instructed by you is Sakra*. You are robbed by him, O splendid
one, of that sovereignty [aisvaryam*] which was yours in the triple world. Surely it is by sila* that all the
worlds were subdued by you, O virtuous one. Knowing this, your sila* was stolen by Mahendra .... Just like
dharma and satya, vrttam* and balam, so do I have my root in sila*, O one of great wisdom. Never doubt
it" [12:124,54-60]
47 I follow Ganguli-Roy and Monier-Williams (s.v. satya) here, although if satyaparakrama* could be
taken as a dvandva used adjectivally (a rarity according to William Dwight Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar
[Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1889; repr. 1960], 2d ed., sec. 193b), the passage would make more
sense: "I dwelt happily in you [when you were] possessed of truth and might," that is, two of the virtues
(balam = parakrama*) he has just lost.

A few observations will indicate some of the significance of this passage, so reminiscent, in the exodus of virtues,
of Satapatha * Brahmana* 1,6,3,1-15.48 First, it is striking that the initial three virtues to leave Prahlada*, and
only these three, are characterized by their tejas, a virtue consistently represented in the Brahmanas* as one of the
first function. Here, too, the virtues which tejas characterizes seemingly fall into the same range. Sila*, however, is
clearly differentiated from the other two, being the root (mula*) of all the virtues and a general requirement for
association with Sri*.49 Satya and dharma, a pair found frequently in the epic, present problems that I will reserve
for the next chapter; but there is little doubt that even in their ordinary meaning"truth" and "justice"they are
qualities connected with sovereignty. From this point on, the trifunctional list of virtues follows in descending
order. Vrttam* has to do with activity, even "good deeds" as Ganguli-Roy translate it; and balam signifies sheer
physical force. On the level of the second function, the latter constitute a pair that would seem to parallel the two
warrior types analyzed by Dumézil: vrttam*-Arjuna-Achilles; balam-Bhima*-Heracles.50 The third function's
pattern appeared before in Satapatha* 11,4,4,11.51 Sri* subsumes it. As a virtue she rounds out the list, and as a
goddessof all the virtues "she" is the only one who bears an epithet of divinityshe follows where the others have
gone.
I might also mention two points where this myth runs parallel to prominent epic themes, showing how patterns
from diverse portions of the epic reinforce each other. First, there is a strong
48 See above (4) following n. 38.
49 For a similar concept, cf. below, n. 57, where Vrtti* (Character, Conduct) is the puroga* of all the
goddesses associated with Sri*; cf. also Mbh. 17:3 where Yudhisthira*, upon entering heaven, is joined with
"prosperity" (sri*; 8-9) and covers the lokas with his tejas, yasas*, and perfection of conduct (vrttasampada*;
27).
50 On the two warrior types, see Dumézil, Destiny of the Warrior, pp. 5, 59, 82-93. Arjuna is the epic's model
for virtuous activity (pravrtti*), and Bhima* incarnates balam at birth (1:114,8 etc.).
51 See above following n. 34.

hint that the most crucial of all these "virtues," even more crucial than sila *, is Sri*, the only one whose departure
brings fear (bhayam) to Prahlada's* face. This final blow to Prahlada's* aisvaryam* is reminiscent of the
hopelessness which overcomes the Pandavas* at the loss of Draupadi*, Yudhisthira's* last stake, in the dice
game.52 Second, the brahmin disguise which Indra assumes to win Sri* is the same as that which the Pandavas*
assume when they win Draupadi*. As Biardeau says, the latter disguise indicates the unification, in Arjuna (and his
brothers), of both the brahman and ksatra* powers.53 One might say, in addition, that both the myth and the epic
point to a unification of these "two powers" with the third-function themes represented by Sri* and Draupadi*.
This resonant but rather schematic narrative gives an account of Sri's* departure from Prahlada's* body, but tells
little if anything about her coming to Indra. The gap is soon filled.
(2) Santiparvan* 215 to 221 finds Bhisma* telling Yudhisthira* about further incidents in the career of Indra. On
each of four occasions the chief of the gods encounters a former foePrahlada*, Bali, Namuci, and Bali againwho
has been "abandoned by Sri*," but who, made wiser by defeat, confronts Indra with the most unsettling truths
about the precariousness of his sovereignty. From Bali, Indra learns both times that dispassion comes from the
insight that everything results from Time (kala*; 217,5-59; 220,21-87). In the first meeting with Bali, Sri* herself
tells Indra: "Neither the Creator nor the Ordainer (dhatr*, vidhatr*] governs me; it is Time alone which causes my
goings-about" (paryayan*; 218,10).
The second of the meetings with Bali informs us the most about Sri's* movements. The account opens by referring
to the tradition that Bali sustained his defeat "when the [three] worlds were bestridden by Visnu*," thus making
Indra king of the gods

(220,7). This reference to a "higher" divine entity than Indra is not the only one in this passage, and henceforth at
least one of the two main godsVisnu * and Siva*will be present in most of the myths we discuss.
As king of the gods, then, but as yet (apparently) without Sri*, Indra sets out with all the classes of gods in train.
Touring the worlds, he chances (?) on Bali in a seaside mountain cave (220, 11), and the two hold their lengthy
talk on the all-powerfulness of Time. But now, instead of Sri*coming directly to Bali's home, as she does in the
first meeting, her appearance demands a new setting.
We are now introduced to Narada*, one of Visnu's* constant and most devoted bhaktas, with his ability to "rove at
will through the three worlds" (221,5). "On a certain daybreak, rising up and wishing to perform pure ablutions, he
went to the Ganges where it issued from the immovable pass [ ? dhruvadvara*], and plunged in" (221,6). The
compound in question presents several possibilities. As the Ganguli-Roy translation says (with Dutt apparently
following): "The commentator [Nilakantha*] is silent. Probably a Himalayan pass. The vernacular translators think
it is the region of the Pole-star that is intended. Dhruva is a name of Brahman [Brahma*] the Creator. It may mean,
therefore, the river as it issues out of Brahman's loka or region. The Puranic myth is that issuing from the foot of
Visnu*, the stream enters the kamandalu of Brahman and thence [goes] to earth."54 It could also be simply the
same as Gangadvara*, an epic name for the present Hardwar; but I think Ganguli is right in supposing that the
context implies someplace more Himalayan. The term, however, seems to refer more to a mythological spot than
to any of the venerable "sources" of the Ganges visited by pilgrims: Gomukh near Gangotri, Badrinath on the
Bhagirathi* tributary, or Kedarnath on the Mandakini*. But whether an "immovable Pass," a specific "Dhruva
pass," a "gate of Brahma*," or an old name for a pilgrimage spot, one

is certain that the waters are pure, probably purer than anywhere else since Narada *?the literal translation of
whose name is "Water-Giver"55was free to go wherever he chose. In fact, this is the crucial point. Indra's
encounter with Sri* will occur at a spot where the Ganga's* waters are purest, the river's earthly source. It is
probably no accident that this is the spot at which other mythsone of which I will turn to shortlylocate their
meetings.56
For what one might call no apparent reason, Indra too has come to this very same bank (tiram*; 221,7). There the
two of them, the god and the rsi*, perform their ablutions and recitations and listen to the meritorious narratives of
the attendant devarsis*. Then, at sunrise, just as they are standing to sing the Sun god's praises, they see in the sky
(akase*) a light to the west equal to that of the sun. This is Sri*, seated on Visnu's* chariot, looking like the solar
disc, attended by numerous Apsarases, and illumining the three worlds with her unrivaled brightness (221,11-12).
When Indra, as usual (cf. 12:218,1-8), fails to recognize her, she introduces herself by a total of sixteen names57
and tells Indra that she has come over to him because

56 Cf. Vam*. P. 50,12-18: after Sri* goes over to Bali (49,15), Indra goes to Brahms and asks: "In what place
may I win great prosperity [udaya] in a short time?" The answer: "in the world of mortals" (martye). Indra
then goes to a bank of the Mahanadi* ("Great River"), a name frequently applied to the Ganges, although also
to other rivers (see s.v., Böhtlink and Roth). Here the Ganges is almost certainly meant. For one thing,
Mahanadi* is referred to as "daughter of the divine sage" (surarsikanya*; 18), probably Bhagiratha*. Where
Indra goes, the river flows "back to Himalaya* in the guise of water" (18). And Mahanadi* is where King
Gaya performed many sacrifices (15 and 16): according to the Mahabharata*, Gaya's sacrifices were
performed at Brahmasaras, a tirtha* were all rivers take their rise (samudbheda; 3:93, 12), a spot further
(according to Sörensen's Index) placed on the Ganges (13:25,1726 = CE 13:26,40?), but also on the Payosni*
(3:121,9-14).

(Constancy), Vijiti (Victory), and Sannati (Humility)are names found among the eight goddesses (the
"foremost" [puroga*] being Vrtti* [Conduct]) who, "distinguished from but dependent on her" (221,81),
accompany Sri* to Indra (82).

of the declining morals of the Asuras. The account concludes with a sort of golden age that begins when Indra, Sri
*, and Narada* return to heaven and rejoin the gods who have assembled to greet them "at a pure and reverenced
spot" (sucau* cabhyarcite* dese*; 221,86).
Whatever the peculiarities of these two accounts, the first of which ends quite differently,58 it is still true that Sri*
is operating largely within the same self-choice mythologem that earlier pertained primarily to Vac*. One might
object that Sri's* choices take her from one Asura (at a time) to the single figure of Indra while Vac* moves from
class to class. But this difference is more apparent than real: as Sri* says in the second account, because the Asuras
were initially highly virtuous, "I dwelt with them for many yugas, from [the time of] the creation of creatures"
(prajasarga*; 221,48). We have, in fact, seen her associated with three successive generations of Asura chiefs:
with Prahlada*, Virocana, and Bali. And, as the second version indicates, the gods all gatheras a classto welcome
her when she comes with Indra and Narada* to heaven.59 Moreover, as regards the "free choice" element of the
Svayamvara* theme, she says in the first account that "Time alone causes [her] goings-about" (218,10), and, in the
second, she tells Indra more pointedly: "I have come to you of my own accord" (mam* svayamanupraptam*;
221,80)60 Thus neither her affiliation in the second account with Visnu* nor in the first with the rhythm of
Timewhich Bhagavad Gita* 11,32 identifies with Visnu* but which here is
58 Sri* tells Indra that she will dwell in him always if he divides her into four portions in accord with the
Vedas (12:218,19)one portion each to Earth, Ocean, Fire, and Brahmins.
59 See also above, n. 45.
60 Sri's* autonomy is instructively compared with the cautionary words of the Sun's daughter Tapati*; refusing
the gandharva* mode of marriage which requires only mutual consent, she tells her suitor, King Samvarana*,
to ask her father, explaining: "I am not my own mistress [nahamisatmano*]; . . . I am not mistress of [my]
body; . . . surely women are never independent" (na svatantra* hi yositah*; 1: 161, 14-16).

regarded as more fundamental than "Creator or Ordainer" does anything to undercut her freedom to bestow her
favor as shoe will.
These * epic passages thus present us with a far more elaborate royal mythology concerning Sri* than is found in
the priestly books of the Brahmanas*. With it, there are certain new developments and certain basic continuities.
On the one hand, Sri's* meanderings, in accord with nothing unless it be the rhythm of Time, give her a coloring
unreported in the Brahmanas*: she is unfaithful to those she favors. Bali pointedly reminds Indra of this twice,
once in each episode:
This Royal Prosperity [rajasri*] which you have obtained and which you consider to be incomparable
formerly dwelt in me. Contrary to that [?], she does not remain in one place [naisa* hyekatra tisthati*].
Indeed, she has dwelt in thousands of Indras who were superior to you. Fickle [lola*], having abandoned
me, she has come to you....Do not brag, O Sakra*. You should become tranquil. [If you] go on in this way,
having abandoned you she will quickly go to another. [217,57-59]
From delusion [mohat*], you long for this Royal Prosperity [rajasri]. Imagined to be stable [sthira], she is
not so for you, nor for us [na casmakam*], nor for others. Passing over many others, she now dwells in
you. Having remained in you for a certain time, O Vasava* [she will prove to be] inconstant [cañcala].
Like a cow abandoning one drinking hole, she will go again to another. [220,44-46]
As Coomaraswamy points out, this theme of fickleness later reaches such a height that "she is described as so
unstable that 'even in a picture she moves,' and if she clings to Narayana*, it is only that she may enjoy His
constant changes of form (vyuhas* and avataras*)!"61
61 Comaraswamy, "Early Indian Iconography: Sri-Lakmi*" (see above, n. 7), P. 178; cf. the
Anusasanaparvan* passage ( 11,19-20) cited at the beginning of this chapter.

On the other hand, there is one unbroken continuity in Sri's * behavior: her movements are related to lists of royal
virtues. In the epic, a trifunctional order is often lost (as in the first passage below) or obscured (as in the second),
especially when Sri* announces the virtues herself and declares them to be a requirement for association with her:
I dwell in truth, gift, vow, austerity, strength, and virtue. [218,12]62
I dwell in the vans and on the banners of victorious kings [rajnam* vijayamananam*] of virtuous
dispositions [dharmasilanam*], as in their dominions and cities. I always dwell in an Indra among men,
one appearing (2) like a conqueror [jitakasini], a hero [sure*], unretreating in battles, O slayer of Bala.
Ever do I dwell in one (1) constant in dharma [dharmanitye], of great intelligence [mahabuddhau*], pious
[brahmanye], humble [prasrite*], and (3) liberally disposed [danasile*]. Formerly I dwelt with the Asuras,
bound by satya and dharma, but having seen them assume adverse natures, I have left them to reside in you.
[221,23-26; probable functional traits numbered in parentheses]
But there are instances where a trifunctional ordering is apparent, especially when Sri* is referred to in the third
person. Indeed, this is most prominently the case in certain passages that show her to be independent of any
requirements the three functions might be thought to impose upon her. In such cases the virtues are not positive
requirements but qualities which in themselveswithout Sri*are negative, which put no hold on her freedom to
choose, to be fickle, and to move on in accord with the rhythm of Time. So it is that Bali, persisting with his
insight that Time is Sri's* only regulative principle, illustrates how the one, like the other, moves on irrespective of
the virtues: "One who is possessed of great learning [vidya*] and one of little learning, one possessed of strength
[balam] and one of little strength, one who is beautiful [darsaniya*] and one who is misshapen [virupa*], one of
good fortune [bhaga] and one of ill

Page 165
fortuneTime, which is profound [gambhira *], sweeps them all away by its own energy [tejas]" (217,18-19). The
context leaves little doubt that Bali is referring to Sri* as well as to Time.
A parallel passage makes this even clearer. As Vidura tells Dhrtarastra* during the long, sleepless night that the
latter spends dreading the prospects of war: "Surely Sri* does not approach [upa-srp*: "for intercourse"; M-W] out
of fear one who is exceedingly respectable [arya*, "of noble family"], one who is an excessive donor [datr*], one
who is a superhero [sura*], one of superlative vows [vrata], or one claiming wisdom [prajna*]" (5:39,50).63 One
might say that the three functions are stable while Sri* is not. Indeed, the trifunctional character of both of these
lists of virtues should be clear, the only problem being arya*, "respectable," "of noble family." This and other
matters with respect to specific virtues will be discussed in the next chapter. It is curious that the most trifunctional
arrangements of virtues are found in passages that treat Sri* as inconstant, perhaps indicating that if the
trifunctional order is an archaic feature, then so is this inconstancy.64 Or, since Sri's* fickleness coincides with a
"pessimistic" view of Time not usually associated with the Brahmanas*, perhaps this "pessimism," preserving the
archaic structure in short formulas, has reoriented the meaning of the virtues by pointing up the insufficiency of
"merits" (to use the word which catches better than "virtues" the present turn of meaning) in the face of the fickle
whimsbetter called the "grace"of the goddess Sri*. That such pessimism was at least the message drawn from these
passages, if not their preservative, is clear from an interpolation
63atyaryamatidataramatisuramativratam* / prajnabhimaninam* caiva srir* bhayannopasarpati*.
64 This theme may surface first with Vac* who, swayed by the gods' playing of the vina*, is said in SB*
3,2,4,3-6 to choose them "vainly" (mogham) over the hymn-singing Gandharvas. See also the figure of
Apala*, "the Unprotected," a Rg* Vedic goddess sometimes identified with Sri* (first by Coomaraswamy,
"Loathly Bride," p. 393), who comes to Indra "having hatred for her husband" (patidvis*: RV* 8,91,4).

made in many Northern manuscripts immediately after the words of Vidura: "Nor [does Sri * dwell] in one of
excessive virtues [atigunavat*], nor one without virtues [nirguna*]; she does not desire [a number of] virtues
[gunan*], nor does she become attached to the absence of virtues [nairgunya*]. Mad like a blind cow, Sri* abides
most anywhere" (Udyogaparvan, 257*). The cow simile had certainly caught on.
Sri* and Draupadi*
Returning to a central problem: how seriously are we to take the epic's insistence that it is Sri* who is incarnate in
Draupadi*? Before I analyze the myths and legends that account for Draupadi's* divine antecedents, let us recall
what Dumézil regards as the second stage of this transposition. The trivalent theology of the Indo-Iranian goddess
provides the first stage, which is grafted onto Indra's wifeoriginally not Sri* but Indrani* or Saci*who, remaining
unique, takes human form to rejoin her husband, who is essentially one but in appearance five. Does Sri* really
need these figures to back her up?
Two prominent myths and one legend tell of Draupadi's* divine identity. The legend and one of the myths were
mentioned in Chapter 3, and the myth again in Chapter 4. There they were examined in connection with Siva*,
Visnu-Narayana*, Vyasa*, and Krishna, with comment stimulated chiefly by the insights of Biardeau. Now,
keeping these earlier results in mind, we must face the questions raised by Dumézil.
(1) The popular legend65 tells the story of the overanxious maidenDraupadi* in a former lifewhose repeated
prayers to Siva* for a husband result in her obtaining five husbands, one for each entreaty. The two versions in the
Critical Edition, both told by Vyasa*, are much the same, differing only in a few matters of phraseology.

According to Vyasa *, there once dwelt in a hermitage a certain unnamed rsi* with an equally unnamed "daughter
[kanya*]66 of slender waist, fair lips, fair brows, and endowed with every virtue" (sarvagunanvita*; 157,667).
Though beautiful and chaste (rupavati* sati*; 7), she was unmarried, and to get a husband she prayed to
Mahadeva* "over and over again: 'I desire a husband endowed with every virtue"' (patim*
sarvagunopetamicchamiti* punah* punah*; 10). honorific descriptions will be discussed later.
(2) Fortunately, with the "first" myth, which Dumézil takes to be the oldest, I can be brief since Dumézil has twice
produced translations of the text and commentaries upon it.68 The passage, from the fifth section of the
Markandeya* Purana*, is structured by the theme of the three sins of the warrior.69 First, guilty of brahminicide,
Indra's tejas ("spiritual force") abandons him and goes over to the god Dharma; second, guilty of breaking a
warrior's agreement, his balam ("physical force") leaves and goes to Vayu*; and third, having violated the
brahmani* Ahalya*, his rupam* ("beauty") leaves him for the Asvins*. At the request of the Earth, who is
oppressed by incarnated demons, the same gods incarnate these portions of Indra in Yudhisthira*, Bhima*, and the
Pandava* Twins respectively, while Indra donates a portion of his own, the remainder of his viryam* ("vigor,
heroism"), to account for the "central" Pandava*? Arjuna. Dumézil has discussed these relocations of Indra's
virtues admirably. Let us simply recall that this scene
66 South Indian vernacular versions of the epic alter the story: Draupadi* in a previous birth was named
Nalayini; married to a rsi*-leper, she served him dutifully until, pleased, he assumed a comely form and
they enjoyed sex. But when he renounced conjugal life she grew angry, and he cursed her to have five
husbands. Here we have not an overanxious maiden but a sex-starved wife; see M. V. Subramanian, Vyasa
and Variations: The Maha-bharata Story (Madras: Higginbothams, 1967), p. 46.
67 This description does not occur in the second version (1:189,41-49).

bears a resemblance to Satapatha * Brahmana* 1,6,3,1 - 16 (see above, after n. 38) and proceed to the crucial
conclusion: "In these five ways did the divine performer of a hundred sacrifices [Indra] incarnate himself. His
highly fortunate wife [mahabhaga* patni*] came out of the fire as Krsna*. Krsna* was the wife of Sakra* and of
none else" (sakrasyaikasya* sa* patni* krsna* nanyasya* kasyacit; Mark. P. 5,24-25).70
Dumézil, of course, sees these verses as referring to Saci*, and as disclosing a stage of the tradition preceding that
in which Draupadi* is connected with Sri*.71 Gonda, on the other hand, agrees with the identification, but reverses
the order of precedence, saying that the passage "altered" the Mahabharata* version (which I will turn to next) "by
declaring that it was Indra's own wife who became incarnate as Draupadi*, without mentioning her name;...it is
highly improbable that Sri* is meant here."72 It seems to me that Gonda comes the closest to representing the tenor
of the Markandeya* passage, which is one in a series of four attempting to resolve difficult questions raised by the
epic, and thus presumably raised after the epic. But if the Markandeya* Purana* has sought to amend the epic
tradition by substituting Saci* for Sri*, it has not made its intent clear. Mahabhaga* could easily describe Sri*. As
the narrative progresses, one sees that it is not so much a matterfor the goddess in questionof following Indra in
person as of following his virtues, one of Sri's* oldest traits. Perhaps, in placing first emphasis on clearing
Draupadi* of the charge of polyandry, the passage tones down the issue of which goddess figures behind her.
Whether it be Sri* or Saci*, the passage is a postepic effort to smooth out one of the epic's trouble spots. There is
no reason to suppose that Indrani* or Saci* plays any role in a second or "intermediate" stage in the construction of
the transposition,

or even in connection with Draupadi's * favoritism for Arjuna.73 In Sri's* relation to Indraand in particular to the
virtuesboth matters can be accounted for. As to the nonappearance of Siva* and for that matter of Visnu*, these
can also be easily explained if the myth is viewed as a late effort to make a tight argument for the clearance of
Draupadi's* name. If Sri* is removed from the drama, this eliminates the need for any "approval" on the part of her
consort Visnu*; and if the marriage is a throughly dharmic act, Siva* need not intervene as instigator of the
adharmic activity.74 Their nonappearance is not a sign that the Markandeya* Purana* myth is the more ancient.
(3) Certainly the Markandeya* myth, despite its admirably clear structure, gives no new specifics about either Sri*
or Saci*. The myth of the five former Indras, from the Mahabharata*, is far more accommodating. I discussed in
Chapter 4 the parallel lines between this myth and the epic dice game. Here, however, the question arises whether
Sri* has a mythology of her own and whether the myth is an old one integrated into an Indian framework.
Dumézil, for instance, speaks of a "Saivite* coloration of the account,"75 and I have insisted in Chapter 3 that it is
not just Siva* but Visnu-Narayana* who is involved. Indeed, it would be more appropriate to reject any sectarian
interpretation and speak of a "Hindu coloration."
When Drupada hears of the Pandavas*' polyandric marriage plans with his daughter, he ventures his opinion that
the union would be adharmic (1:188,7-9). Vyasa* then takes him aside to a private chamber. There the incarnation
of Narayana* makes two revelations of the identities of the proposed partners. The second is a version of the
overanxious maiden story. The first is close enough to the Markandeya* Purana* account for Dumézil to assume a
connection between them.

Once, when the gods had assembled to perform a great Soma sacrifice (sattra) in Naimisa * forest, Yama became
the officiant in charge of slaying the animals (the samitra*; 1:189,1). With Yama thus preoccupied, there were no
deaths in the world's human population. Disturbed at this loss of a distinction between the human and the divine,
the gods complained to Prajapati*, who promised that as soon as Yama's work was finished the king of the dead
would make up for lost time. Satisfied, the gods returned to their sattra.
"This strange assembly," as Dumézil puts it,76 now serves as the starting point for the central narrative. The "high-
powered" (mahabalah*) gods, with certain exceptions, find themselves beside the Ganga*. There they see a golden
lotus which has floated downstream (189,9). Wonder-struck (vismita) at the sight, the heroic (sura*) Indra leaves
the assembly and sets out alone to follow the river upstream. There "where the Ganga* is perennially brought
forth" (yatra ganga* satatam* samprasuta*; 189, 10), that is, the same spotat least symbolicallywhere we have
seen Indra meet Sri* before,77 he sees a weeping young woman (yosa* rudati*) who has entered the "divine
Ganga*" (gangam* devim*) to bathe. Whenever her teardrops fall on the water, they turn into lotuses of gold
(189,11). Beholding this marvel, Indra asks her who she is.
The answer is a promise: "You will know me here [iha], O Sakra*; who I am and why, having little luck
[mandabhagya*], I weep.78 Follow me." (189,13). Sri* has gone unrecognized before, always on account of that
awesome radiance which makes it impossible to distinguish one perfection of femininity from another: as Bali says
to Indra, "I do not know whether she is an asuri*, a devi*, or a manusi*" (12:218,4). But here Indra has
76Ibid.
77 See above, at nn. 54-55.
78 This promise (note the iha), and the mythological convergences discussed in the following, leave me
unconvinced by J. A. B. van Buitenen's remark that "it does not become clear who she is"; van Buitenen, The
Mahabharata*, I 465, note to 189, 10ff.

a better and more specific reason for failing to know her. Sri * is appearing as her own opposite, one might almost
say in disguise: mandabhagya*, literally "having an impoverished share," and weeping, she is the very antithesis of
what one would expect if he were looking for the goddess of Prosperity whose "share," one might say, is indicated
by her name.
Led by the tearful girl, Indra soon sees a sight now familiar: a handsome youth and another young woman, Siva*
(sometimes called the lord of tears) and his consort Parvati*, seated not far off on a Himalayan mountain peak
playing dice. Carelessly, Indra flings him a challenge, what may be no more than his standard, if boastful, form of
address: "Know that this entire universe stands under my power. I am the lord" (mamedam* tvam* viddhi visvam*
bhuvanam* vase* sthitam / iso* 'hamasmiti*; 189,15). Undisturbed, Siva* continues his game, managing only a
smile and a glance at the indignant Indra. The glance alone, however, is enough to leave Indra paralyzed, standing
there "like a stake" (sthanur*-iva; 189, 16), apparently a pun on one of Siva's* names. And there Indra stands until
the dice game is finished, at which point Siva* decides to quell Indra's pride (darpa; 189,17).
This segment of the myth points toward one of the features that has led Dumézil to speak of a "Saivite coloration."
As he says: "Indra's sin...is a lack of respect, an involuntary one, toward a superior god.... That cannot be old. The
mythology of the Brahmanas* certainly knows the sins of Indra. It has even drawn up inventories of them. No item
is of this type."79 This seems to suggest, in particular, that the theme of Indra's three sins has been submerged
beneath a lesson in Siva's* superiority.
We saw in Chapters 3 and 4, however, that Siva's* part is well integrated with that of Sri*. Let us now observe
their roles more closely. Siva* first tells the weeping girl to bring Indra to him. But "scarcely touched by her"
(sprstamatrastaya*), Indra's limbs are all loosened (srastairangaih*), and he falls to the ground.

This mysterious touch does not fulfill Siva's * command to bring Indra to him and seems strange in the text. In
fact, Siva* seems to disregard its consequences when he tells the supposedly disabled Indra that "as your strength
[balam] and heroism [viryam*] are unlimited," Indra should remove a huge stone that covers a cave in a mountain
peak and enter therein. Inside Indra joins four others who, like himself, are "of the splendor of Surya*" (189, 19).
Greatly distressed, he asks if he is to become like them, and Siva*eyes widened in angeranswers: "Enter this cave,
Satakratu*; from folly [balyal*] you have insulted me" (189, 21). Hearing these words, once again Indra's limbs
are loosened, just as they were by the tearful Sri* (189,22), and he shakes like a fig leaf in the wind.
Sri's* touch is gratuitous, perhaps an anachronism in this myth; whatever its meaning, its effects are unrecorded.
The theme of Indra's first contact (he does not recognize her) with Sri* and the kingship she represents has, it
seems, been reinterpreted as a lesson in divine priorities. The king of the gods learns that he is not the lord of the
universe. One might say that Indra, lured by golden lotuses, has gone to find Prosperity, or Sovereignty, and has
instead learned about their limitations.
Hoping for a change of heart, Indra turns to flattery. But Siva* holds to his curse: "Here those of such behavior

Accepting these impositions, the four former Indras (purvendrah*) speak for themselves as well as for "our" Indra,

Dharma, Vayu *, Maghavat (a name for Indra), and the Asvins* (27). "Our" Indra seems to solve the difficulty of
how he could both be imprisoned and free, as Maghavat, to engender a human offspring, by adding: "By my
heroism [viryam*] I shall create from myself a purusa* to be the fifth of these for the sake of this task."81
Siva* then agrees to this set of proposals, "and he also appointed that young woman, desired by the world
[lokakanta*], Sri* herself, to be their wife among men" (189,29). Furthermore, as we saw in Chapter 3, Visnu-
Narayana* gives his approval, and the way is thus prepared for the births of the Pandavas*, of Draupadi*, andwith
Visnu* contributing his black and white hairsof Krishna and Balarama* (31).
This is the end of the myth as presented by Vyasa*, but one must take into account the ensuing events fully to
interpret it. Having concluded his exposition, Vyasa* grants Drupada a celestial eye (divyam* caksuh*) with which
to see the Pandavas* and Draupadi* in their "meritorious bodies of old" (189,35). Presumably this would be the
way they saw each other, in particular the way that Indra saw Sri*, when, as she had promised him, he would come
to know her. Yet when this was, we do not know; probably the marriage itself is the fulfillment of the promise.
"Then he [Drupada] saw them [the Pandavas*] as celestials, garlanded with golden diadems, each resembling
Sakra*, having the color of Pavaka* [Agni] or Aditya* [the Sun], their chaplets tied, of delightful form, youthful,
broadchested and tall as palmyra trees, exceedingly adorned with dustless celestial robes and the most excellent

(sarvagunopapannan*; 189,37-38). Wonder-struck, Drupada turns to his daughter, and, having admired her
Srilike* beauty, he regards her as "worthy to be

their wife for her beauty [rupam *], majesty [tejas], and fame [yasas*]."82
This conclusion sharpens our focus on a theme observed in the story of the overanxious maiden, which I will
pursue more thoroughly in the next chapter. Being like the Adityas*, Sri-Draupadi's* husbands are
sarvagunopapanna*, "endowed with every virtue." Most important, Sri* (or Draupadi* seen as Sri*) is the Indras'
(or the Pandavas* seen as Indras) suitable partner because of her rupam* (why should it not be listed first in her
case, especially as Drupada had just noticed it?), her tejas, and her yasas*. Each of these virtues has appeared on
its appropriate functional level in the preceding discussion. In contrast to the trivalent goddesses, Sri* claims the
second-function virtue of fame rather than one connected with strength. I have translated tejas, as "majesty" in this
context, but it is the same term that has occupied the first rank in the Brahmanas*, in the downfall of Prahlada*,
and in the birth of Yudhisthira* from Dharma.
Dumézil thinks this myth has undergone a "clumsy Saivite* retouching."83 But, as we have seen, it is not just a
matter of Siva*, and Dumézil overlooks some of the more peculiar features of the myth. As to the roles of Siva*
and Narayana*, although I have adopted the term "Hindu coloration," I do not mean to confine this to a late or
even "postepic" period. As I began to stress in Chapters 3 and 4 and shall re-emphasize in Part 3, I believe that
oppositions and relations between Visnu* and Siva* are too thoroughly ingrained into the epic to be automatically
explained away as interpolations. The activities of these deities seem rather to have been worked into the epic in an
early, formative period of the poem's construction. When an

83ME, I, 113. Although it is well integrated into the rest of the epic (see above, Chapter 4), Dumézil argues
that the theme of "the multiple Indras" cannot be early and that the fundamental theme is that of the three sins;
but on this, see Chapters 9 and 10 below.

Indian myth or legend is articulated through roles played by Visnu * and/or Siva*, it is sometimes possible to see
that India has preserved ancient traditions and themes by linking them with these divinities. As Dumézil has
shown, something along these lines seems to have happened, probably very early, with the Sisupala* legend.84 It is
now time to see whether the same may be said of this myth concerning Sri*.
The Source of Sovereignty
With all its oddities and "colorations," the myth of Sri* and the five Indras is the only myth in which Sri* does
something of her own, under her own name, not done by any other goddess. Comparing this myth with traditions
about Sri's* analogue in Irish tradition, a figure with whom she has often been compared before85the goddess
Flaith or Flaith Érenn (Sovereignty [of Ireland])results in some surprising parallels. Here follows a condensation of
the two oldest versions of the Flaith legend.86
(1) When King Daire was told that a "son of Daire" named Lugaid would attain Ireland's Sovereignty, he gave each
of his five sons this name. At the assembly of Telltown, where his sons had come to race horses, Daire learned
from a Druid that "a fawn with a golden lustre" would enter the assembly and that whichever son caught it would
rule. When the fawn came "into the assembly," Daire's sons pursued it until it was finally caught by Lugaid Laigde.
Then snow fell, and one son went for shelter, finding a house occupied by "a huge old woman,
84 See ME, II, 91.

Celtic Heritage, pp. 73-76; Dumézil, ME, II, 342.
86 Both legends are from portions of the "Book of Ballymote," a manuscript from the fourteenth century, but
containing much older material; Krappe has summarized them in "Sovereignty of Erin," pp. 444-45 and 448-
49. I mainly follow his summaries, but also quote from the texts as translated by (for Lugaid Laigde) Whitley
Stokes and Ernst Windisch, Iristhe Texte, III (Leipzig: Herzel, 1897), 316-23, sec. 70, and (for Niall) Whitley
Stokes, "The Adventure of the Sons of Eochaid Muigmedón," Revue Celtique, XXIV (1903), 190-207; cf.
Dumézil, ME, II, 335-36.

...her spears of teeth outside her head, and great, old, foul, faded things upon her." Refusing to lie with her on the
bed she offered, he was told he had thus severed himself from "sovereignty." After three more brothers came and
went with the same events, Lugaid Laigde went and said, "I will sleep alone with thee." Having followed her to the
bed, to his astonishment "it seemed to him that the radiance of her face was the sun rising in the month of May....
Then he mingled in love with her. 'Auspicious is your journey,' said she, 'I am the sovranty, and the kingship of
Erin will be obtained by thee.'" The other brothers then came and all feasted "on the freshest of food and the oldest
of ale."
(2) Eochaid Muigmedón, king of Ireland, had four sons by the "witch-queen" Mongfind, and one, Niall, by a
captive Saxon princess. In a test to see which of them was fittest to rule, they were told by a wizard to go on a
hunt. When they stopped, they cooked what they had caught and became thirsty. Fergus, the first to volunteer,
"went seeking for water, till he chanced on a well" guarded by a hideous hag who would let him drink only for a
kiss. This he, and two more sons of Mongfind, refused to do and they got no water; then the fourth son, Fiachra,
gave her only the barest brush of a kiss, and in return got a brief moment of kingship. Last of all Niall came for
water and consented to kiss and "lie with" the hag, who then turned into a beautiful woman. Asked who she was,
she answered "I am Sovereignty," and told him to establish "seniority" over his brothers.
Setting these two Irish variants beside the myth of Indra and Sri *, and recalling Indra's second meeting with Bali
(B),87 the parallels are obvious, especially if the myth's main narrative (1-6) and sequel ([7]-[8]) are differentiated
from the problematic opening scene (A)88 and the "Hindu colorations" (B-H).
87 See above, n. 56 and preceding text.
88 Cf. Dumézil, ME, I, 112-13, also detaching this scene.

beginning a golden age under Indra's sovereignty (B). been given to only one.
Thus, beyond the roles of Siva* and Narayana* may be an archaic Indo-Irish, perhaps Indo-European,89 myth or
legend of sovereignty; but there are difficulties. First, the results of the "first contacts" with Sri* and Flaith (item 6)
are entirely different, and if there is a connection, it must result from the Indian story's postponement of her self-
disclosure until after things are straightened out with Siva*. Second, in the Irish stories the group that goes into the
forest is identical with the one that benefits from the final disclosure, but the Indian story presents a disjunction.
On the one hand, there are the gods who sacrifice in Naimisa* forest, from among whom our Indra, unlike the
89 cf. Ferdowsi's "ancient legend" (Levy, Epic of Kings, pp. 81-83) in which three Pahlavans* and other
knights hunt game and come upon a "ravishing maid." Though beautiful at the start, she has entered the
forest "weeping tears of blood," her father having beaten her. In fact she is a Turanian princess, and her
"coming over" to Iran reminds one of myths about Vac* and Sri*. The Pahlavans* argue over her and take
her to Shah Kavus* for arbitration. The latter recognizes her for the prize she is with intriguing words:
"This is a mountain doe, truly a heart ravishing gazelle; but game appropriate only to the highest," and
marries her himself.

Irish brothers, is the only one to set out. On the other hand, there is the group of the five Indras, four of whom, like
the four brothers who precede Niall and Lugaid on their searches, have preceded our Indra to the watery "source"
of Sovereignty. The disjunction in the Indian story is difficult to explain. Perhaps the Indian authors would not
imagine other gods to have preceded Indra and been turned back by failure. Or perhaps the four "former" Indras are
the ones who did precede him. The fact of the disjunction, in any case, accords well with the general impressions,
first, that the forest assembly is detachable and, second, that the theme of the previous Indras is anomalous.90
Finally, Sri * herself is never described as loathsome. Moreover, within the context of the epic's myth, the reason
she gives for her tearsthe loss of her former husbandsis not unsatisfactory. As Coomaraswamy has pointed out,
however, Sri* does have her unattractive opposite selves: Alaksmi*, Kalakanni*.91 Moreover, if he is right in
seeing the Vedic and Brahmanic* Apa1a* as a precursor of Sri*, there is a precedent for Indra having a "loathly
bride" who is transformed not at his touch, but by a series of operations in which the god removes her reptilian
skin by drawing her through three different holes in his chariot and thus making her "sun-skinned."92
These differences and possible transformations are no less striking than the fundamental unity of outline.
Moreover, the Indian and Irish accounts introduce a number of symbols that
90 See above, n. 83; as argued there, the theme of the five Indras is not necessarily late. In fact, an effort to
explain it along Puranic* lines is an interpolation; see Adiparvan* 1916*, following 1:189,28, where at
least two (Santi*, Sibi*) and probably three (if Rtadhama* = Ritudhama*) of the four former Indras are
given names which come to be those of the Indras of the fourteen Manvantaras (see VP 3,1).

are connected with sovereignty, some of which seem to be Indo-Irish and perhaps Indo-European. I have
suggested that the golden lotus is an Indianization of the theme of the animal, usually wild and golden, that
symbolizes and shows the way to Sovereignty.93 Actually, the deer is not un-Indian. The royal deer hunt has
altered many a royal destiny (Yayati *, Samvarana*, Samtanu*, Pandu*, Rama* Dasaratha*), although often
adversely; and, as Jaiswal tells us, "the Sri-sukta* calls her [Sri*] harini*, of the form of a deer, and on some
Kuninda* coins of the first century B.C. she appears with a deer by her side."94 Again, in both the Irish and Indian
traditions there are two liquids connected with sovereignty: water and beer, water and soma. In Ireland,
Sovereignty, in addition to her place by the well, is depicted "wearing a golden crown and seated on a crystal
throne, having before her a vat of red liquor, from which she pours a draught into a gold cup which she hands to
each successive king of Ireland."95 And in India, Sri*, with her affinity for the pure waters at the source of the
Ganges, may have her prototype in Apala* who, as "a maiden coming down to the water" (kanya* var avayati*),
finds some soma (RV* 8,911), masticates it in what Dumézil takes as an archaic fashion,96 and transmits it to
Indra by mouthin fact, according to the Brahmana* commentary (can this be the other side of Sir's* paralyzing
touch?), by a kiss.97
These Indo-Irish themes and symbols would seem to allow extension of the number of traditions that stem from a
common

royal heritage98 to include the myths of Sri * and Flaith. So far, however, our views of the epic passage and the
Indo-Irish correspondence have been shaped by this comparison alone. Actually, there are traditions that would
seem to be intermediary between the Sri* and Flaith stories, which will allow us to draw the correspondences more
tightly together.
The first comes from a province that, to my knowledge, Indo-European comparativists have so far left untouched.
This is Ceylon, an island whose major language, Singhalese, is Indo-European, but whose religious traditions,
shaped by Buddhism, have seemed an unlikely preservative for Indo-European themes. My focus is on a royal
legend related only loosely to Buddhism and connected much more revealingly with Hindu themes. It is the legend
of Vijaya ("Victory," a frequent name for Arjuna), the island's first king.99
Vijaya's antecedents place his story in the category of "first king" legends.100 His grandfather was a lion (the king
of beasts; Mahavamsa* 6,3) and his mother a woman, and their children both bore the epithet "Lion" in their
names: a son Sihabahu* ("Lion-armed" as his "hands and feet were formed like a lion's"; 6,10) and Sihasivali*,
their daughter. These children marry and found a city called Sihapura* in a kingdom called Lala*; and they have
sixteen sets of twin sons, Vijaya being the older of the eldest pair. He becomes prince regent, but he "was

of evil conduct and his followers were even (like himself), and many intolerable deeds of violence were done by
them." The people prevailed upon the king to rebuke them. "But all fell out again as before, the second and yet a
third time; and the angered people said to the king: 'kill thy son'" (6,39-44). One would love to know what these
"three sins" of Vijaya were.
Vijaya and his followers, seven hundred men, are then punished: the hair is shaved off half their heads,101 and
they are exiled to the sea, their children and wives also departing but in separate boats. The two groups land on
separate islands, the men thus being without their women and children. Their final destiny is Lanka * (Ceylon).
Here the story is linked with Buddhism: Vijaya "landed in Lanka* . . . on the day that the Tathagata* lay down
between the two twinlike sala-trees to pass into nibbana*" (6,46). But connections with figures of Hindu
provenance are more immediately significant. As the Buddha lies in his final position, he tells Indra to protect
Vijaya in Ceylon so that Buddhism may ultimately flourish there. Hearing this, "Indra handed over the
guardianship of Lanka* to the god who is in color like the lotus" (devass' uppalavannassa* Lanka-rakkam*
samappayi; 7,5). Geiger identifies this guardian as Visnu*, the allusion being "to the color of the BLUE lotus
(uppala)."102 Just as Visnu-Narayana* "approves" or even "arranges"103 the union of Sri* and Indra (or Sri* and
the five Indras), Visnu* now helps bring about the marriage of Vijaya. First, accepting Indra's directive, Visnu*
comes to Lanka*, where he takes on the disguise of an ascetic. When Vijaya comes before him with his men,
Visnu* promises them that "no dangers will arise," sprinkles water on them, and ties a protective thread about their
hands. Then, disappearing into the air, he gives way to a Yakkhini* (Sanskrit Yaksini*) who, in the form of a
bitch, passes

before them (7,6-9). For men who have just set foot on an unknown terrain, it seems that a female dog is more
alluring than a deer:
One [of Vijaya's men] went after her, although he was forbidden by the prince (for he thought), "Only
where there is a village are dogs to be found." Her mistress, a yakkhini * named Kuvanna*, sat there [where
Vijaya's man followed the bitch] at the foot of a tree spinning, as a woman-hermit [tapasi*] might.
When the man saw the pond [near the tree] and the woman hermit sitting there, he bathed there and drank
and taking shoots of lotuses and water in lotus-leaves he came forth again. And she said to him: "Stay! thou
art my prey! Then the man stood there as if fast bound. But because of the power of the magic thread she
could not devour him.... Then the yakkhini* seized him, and hurled him who cried aloud into a chasm [tam
gahetva* surungayam* ravantam yakkhini* khipi]. And there in like manner she hurled (all) the seven
hundred one by one after him.
And when they all did not return fear came on Vijaya; armed,... he set out, and when he beheld the beautiful
pond [pokkharanim* subham; note its prominent lotuses cited above], where he saw no footstep of any man
coming forth, but saw that woman-hermit [tapasim*] there, he thought: "Surely my men have been seized
by this woman." And he said to her, "Lady, hast thou seen my men?" "What dost thou want with thy
people, prince?" she answered. "Drink thou and bathe."
Then it was clear to him: "This is surely a yakkhini*, she knows my rank," and swiftly, uttering his name,
he came at her drawing his bow. He caught the yakkhini* in the noose about the neck, and seizing her hair
with his left hand he lifted his sword in the right and cried: "Slave! give me back my men, or I slay thee!"
Then tormented with fear the yakkini* prayed him for her life. "Spare my life, sir, I will give thee a
kingdom [rajjam dassami* te aham] and do thee a woman's service and other service as thou wilt." [7,10-
22]
Vijaya makes her return his men and provide food for them. The men prepare the food, and Kuvanna* eats first, at
which she was well pleased.

...and assuming the lovely form of a sixteen-year-old maiden she approached the prince adorned with all
the ornaments.104 At the foot of a tree she made a beautiful bed, well-covered around with a tent, and
adorned with a canopy. And seeing this, the king's son, looking forward to the time to come, took her to
him as his spouse and lay (with her) blissfully on that bed; and all his men encamped around the tent. [7,26-
29]
From here on the story veers sharply from anything in the other traditions we have discussed,105 but the parallels
that have emerged to this point are sufficient to guarantee some connection.
A number of themes here help us to draw the Indian and Irish stories of Sri * and Flaith much closer together. As
in the myth of Sri* and the five Indras, Visnu* has a background role. In one case, the god "approves" the marriage
and Vyasa*, an ascetic "portion" of the god on earth, is the medium by which the Pandavas* are directed to
Draupadi-Sri*; in the other, the god assumes the form of an ascetic to protect Vijaya and his men and prepare the
way for their meeting with the Yakkhini* Kuvanna*. Then too, just as Indra has his limbs loosened and his body
paralyzed before he is told to enter a cave and join the four former Indras, so Vijaya's men "stood there as if fast
bound" before being thrown into a "chasm." In fact, this parallel can solve an earlier quandary: unlike Sri*, whose
limb-loosening touch is superfluous and who yields to Siva* when it comes to the paralyzing of Indra and the
command that Indra join his predecessors in the cave, Kuvanna* is able to do all these things by herself. The Irish
stories offer no parallel to

rajaputtam* upaganchi* sabbabharanabhusita* ( 26 -27).

this dangerous side of the bestower of sovereignty, but the Ceylonese legend may be the most coherent version of
an ancient Indian theme. In both the Ceylonese and Indian accounts, the contact with Sovereignty seems to hold
inherent dangers for those who are rash or unequipped to deal with its burdens and benefits.
Seemingly, however, neither the Ceylonese nor the Indian account borrows directly from the other. In other
respects, the Ceylonese and the Irish accounts are much closer to each other than either is to the myth of Sri *. For
one thing, the theme of the "loathly bride," so famous in the Irish accounts, emerges far more clearly in the
Ceylonese legend than in the Indian myth. Just as the Irish Flaith turns from hag to beauty, Kuvanna* the
Yakkhini* is transformed from a tapasi*an identity which no doubt connotes ragged clothes, unkempt appearance,
emaciated physiqueto the loveliest of young maidens. Second, the story linking the bitch and the Yakkhini* in
some ways resembles Flaith and the fawn more than Sri* and the lotus, the latter two being connected principally
by their golden color. In both the Irish and Ceylonese examples it is an unexpected animalcurious and alluring for
different reasons that leads the heroes (in this case, Niall and his brothers, not the five Lugaids) to the unpredictable
maiden by the water. And finally, the Ceylonese and Irish legends are much more clearly concerned with the matter
of the bestowal of kingship: rajjam dassami* te aham, says Kuvanna*, where Sri* only promises, for some time in
the indefinite future, that Indra will come to "know" her.
Thus, as suggested earlier, the Ceylonese story seems to be an intermediary between the Flaith and Sri* myths,
probably containing more archaic features than the latter but bearing many of the same themes. It is also close,
especially on one point, to another legend which would seem to have a similar intermediary status. This one comes
from the Mahabharata* and concerns none other than the Pandavas*.

One might expect that if the myth of Sri * and the five Indras is an ancient parallel to the Irish and Ceylonese
legends, the epic poets would have had the Pandavas*and King Yudhisthira* in particular, not Arjunawin
Draupadi*, Sri's* portion on earth, in a similar scene. Obviously they do not, as Draupadi* is won in the
Svayamvara*. It seems fair to say that the poets have taken this "secondary" myth of Sri*the "Svayamvara*
mythologem" which she shares with so many other goddesses as their model rather than the older myth that finds
her by the water, by the "source" of Sovereignty. Instead of using this latter myth as a model for Draupadi's*
marriage, the poets satisfied themselves by linking it to the marriage as a background myth. But if the Pandavas*
do not win their bride in such a scene, they do find themselves in an unmistakably similar situation. It occurs in the
Yaksaproana* section of the Aranyakaparvan*.
Toward the end of their forest exile, the Pandavas* and their wife enter the picturesque Dvaita forest (3:295,2-3).
There, "for the sake of a brahmin, they underwent a great affliction whose consequence was happiness" (295,6).
Their trial begins when the brahmin, "in great distress," rushes up to them with the news that the continuity of his
Agnihotra has been threatened by a "great deer" (mahamrga*) which, in butting about near his hermitage, has
caught the brahmin's two rubbing sticks (arani*) in its antlers and bounded off into the forest (295,8-9). "Quickly
tracking down that great deer by its footprints, may you Pandavas* bring them [the rubbing sticks] back" (2,95, 10).
It is soon made clear that this is no ordinary deer: "Seeing the deer nearby, those great chariot warriors released
barbs, javelins, and darts, but were unable to pierce it. And while they were so striving, the deer became invisible
[nadrsyata*]. And not seeing it, fatigued and pained, those high-spirited ones approached a nyagrodha tree, deep
in the forest, and sat down in its cool shade wearied by hunger and thirst" (ksutpipasaparitan-*

gah *; 295,13-15). Similarly, Niall and his brothers were "athirst and in great drouth" after eating the deer which
Niall, unlike the Pandavas*, managed to capture. Success of the hunt, however, may not be crucial. The central
matter is that the animal (or flower) be mysterious and alluring, a device to draw the heroes into forested or
uncertain terrain and, in the two cases just cited, to make them thirsty.
Choosing from among his wearied brothers, Yudhisthira* tells Nakula to look around for water (196,6). Soon
Nakula arrives at a lake of "pure water" (vimalam* toyam; 296,11). But a voice from the sky warns him against
drinking: "Do not commit this rash act, O child; I have first claim to this lake. Having answered my questions, then
may you drink and carry" (12). Nakula drinks, however, and falls dead, as do Sahadeva, Arjuna, and Bhima*, in
turn, each after failing to heed the same warning from the disembodied voice (14-38).
Finally, when Yudhisthira* arrives on the scene, he sees his brothers "fallen like the Lokapalas* at the end of the
yuga" (297,1). Realizing that there is something uncanny about their deaths (no weapon marks, no corpselike
pallor), he asks who is responsible, and the voice from the sky introduces itself as a crane living off tiny fish
(297,11). He too is warned not to drink the water before answering its questions. But when Yudhisthira* ridicules
the idea that a bird could have slain his brothers, the voice turns into that of a Yaksa* (297,18). Seeing his
strangeness, Yudhisthira* agrees to try to answer the Yaksa's* questions, and thesenineteen riddles (according to
the Critical Edition), each with four partsconstitutes the long Yaksaprasna* section (297,23-24) of this episode and
ostensibly its raison d'être.106
Yudhisthira* is able to answer all the questions correctly, and the Yaksa* allows him to choose from among his
brothers just

one who can be restored to life. Yudhisthira * selects Nakula (297,66), giving as his reason that both of his father's
wives should have one living son (72-73). Thanks to this dharmic choice, the Yaksa* grants that all the brothers
may be revived. In a moment they rise up, their thirst and hunger gone (298,1). Yudhisthira* then asks the Yaksa*
once again who he really is, and this time he reveals himself as Dharma, Yudhisthira's* own father. Dharma gives
two reasons for his behavior: he has "come here desiring to see you" (298,6) and "to examine you" (jijnasustvam*;
10). Satisfied, Dharma offers Yudhisthira* a choice of boons, and Yudhisthira* chooses three, each with its
implications.
(1) First, Yudhisthira* asks that the brahmin might have back his firesticks from the thieving deer to continue his
Agnihotra. Dharma's answer solves a problem that appears elsewhere: "The firesticks of that brahmin that were
borne away were carried off by me, having the antlers of a deer [several recensions: having the form of a deer], for
the sake of examining you" (hrtam* maya* mrgavesena* [mrgarupena*] kaunteya jijnasartham* tava; 298,13 and
notes). And further on, Dharma repeats that the sticks were carried away "by me in deer form" (maya* . . .
mrgarupena*; 20). Such double symbolism has intrigued Krappe and Dumézil; the alluring deer and the figure by
the water are identical, in this case both being forms taken by Dharma.107 We have seen similar solutions
elsewhere: the bitch that takes Vijaya's man to Kuvanna* is the latter's attendant; Sri*, who once appears in deer
form and also with a deer beside her,108 allures Indra by her own tears; and in a case which Dumézil handles
beautifully, the Indian heroine Madhavi*, also a bestower of kingship, adopts the ascetic "deer-faring" mode of life
(mrgacgrini*; Mbh. 5:118,7)109 To this one may now add the

words of Shah Kavus *, cited above:110 "This [girl] is a mountain doe, truly a heart-ravishing gazelle; but game
appropriate only to the highest." What the convergence signifies in the present instance is quite clear' the epic poets
have looked behind the cooperative interplay of the symbols of sovereignty for the underlying principledharmathat
sustains it.
(2) Yudhisthira's* second boon is Dharma's assurance that the Pandavas* and Draupadi* will pass their thirteenth
year in exile unrecognized (298,15), thus fulfilling the terms of their wager with Duryodhana. If not world
sovereignty, this boon confers a prize that is still tantamount to a share of kingship, for by completing the year
incognito, Yudhisthira* expects to fulfill the requirements for a return to his throne at Indraprastha.
(3) Urging Yudhisthira* to choose again, Dharma says: "May you accept a third boon, O son, that is unequaled and
great [varamapratimam* raahat]; surely you are sprung from me, O king, and Vidura shares a portion of me"
(mamamsabhak*; 298,21). After briefly demurring, Yudhisthira* asks: "May I always conquer covetousness,
delusion, and greed, O lord, and may my mind be ever devoted to giving, austerity, and truth" (dane* tapasi satye;
298,23).
There is nothing trifunctional about these qualities, although, as I will argue in the next chapter, the ideal royal
virtues often take on an increasing "yogic" or "Upanisadic*" flavor. More important, for now, is Dharma's answer.
Not only does Yudhisthira* have these qualities; he has them in accordance with a particular formulathe one by
which the over-anxious maiden, Draupadi* in a former life, requested a perfect husband and which describes the
Adityatlike* Pandavas* as her suitable partners when they are revealed to her father as the five former Indras.
"You are by your own nature [svabhavenasi*] endowed with every virtue [upapanno gunaih* sarvaih*], O son of
Pandu*, and, moreover, you are the lord Dharma [bhavandharmah*]; what you have asked for shall be yours"
(298,24). As we

will see, this is a royal formula; once again, Yudhisthira * receives.a boon that is tantamount to "sovereignty."
There can be little doubt that this legend about the Pandavas* is, like the Ceylonese Vijaya legend, a link between
the stories about Sri* and Flaith. First, it shares with the Vijaya legend the substitution of a Yaksa*, male this time,
for Sri*111the choice of sex in the epic story no doubt being dictated by the identification of the deer and the
figure by the lake with Dharma, a figure with whom Yudhisthira* is identified rather than one he might marry.
Then, on the Indian side, the Pandava* story gives added evidence of themes that Ireland does not know. Contact
with the figure by the lake, or the source of the Ganges, holds grave dangers for those unsuited to sovereignty: just
as the five Indras are ordered into a cave and Vijaya's men hurled into a chasm, so Yudhisthira* finds his brothers
"fallen like the Lokapa1as*." But in its basic outlines, the Pandava* story is, like the Vijaya legend, far more
similar to the legends from Ireland: the "great deer," the figure by the "pure water," and especially the underlying
theme of the test, this time by riddles, of Yudhisthira's* worthiness, all find their analogues in the stories of Niall
and Lugaid Laigde.
Finally, not only have we been able to show that Sri* has an ancient mythology of her own, but that this myth has
survived, on the epic plane, without her. No doubt the "borrowed" myth of the Svayamvara* has taken its place in
Sri's* biography and has provided the model for Draupadi's* union with the Pandavas*, and in particular with
Arjuna. For just as this "central" Pandava* wins Draupadi* for his brothers, Indra is the chief of the gods whom
Sri* "chooses" in the epic's renditions

of the "Svayamvara * mythologem." But insofar as the true sovereignty is Yudhisthira's*, it is fittingly promised
him in a variant of an ancient legend, one that has its closest analogues in Irish and Ceylonese traditions and in the
very myth that is told when the Pandavas* are about to take Draupadi*, Sri* incarnate, as their common wife.

Chapter 8
The Royal Virtues
In the course of examining the myths and legends related to the figures of Sri * and Draupadi*, repeated references
have been made to the notion of "virtues": gunas* or dharmas. In many instances specific sets are singled out,
often in what appear to be trifunctional arrangements. This unwieldy and diffuse problem nonetheless bears on
many matters: on our understanding of Sri* and Draupadi*, on the epic "sins"opposite the virtueswhich I will take
up in the next chapters, and on the whole question of sovereignty.
The themes from such myths, legends, and rituals as those discussed in the last chapter must be drawn together
with the extensive epic material concerning dharmic formulas. To do this, however, it must first be recognized that
the Mahabharata* is open-ended as a source on ethical matters. Seeking some clarity, many scholars have
separated the "narrative" from the "didactic" elements and viewed all moral pronouncements as one or another
variety of Brahminical interpolation. I do not think it is that simple: questions of virtue and sin are part and parcel
of the epic narrative. The problem is to understand how certain basic virtues and vices, often recognizable by their
relations to other moral qualities and thus by their places in structures and formulas, enter into the fabric of the
story. Determining such values will not, of course, rule out speaking of didactic intrusions and extensions. But it
will not be simply ??atter of explaining epic morality as a Brahminical veneer over a "heroic" core. The situation
is too fluid: probably from its earliest Indian tellings, virtues of different types have

found reflection in the story; and the story has probably continued to suggest different dharmic formulations to
poets of different periods.
Inflations
One line along which epic morality has been rethought by the poets is that suggested by the Upanisads *. Although
scholars have commonly overlooked the ethical pronouncements of the Upanisadic* sages and depicted their state
as one beyond good and evil, the Upanisads* do exalt certain types of behavior, certain virtues. The knower of the
Self creates worlds of refuge for all other creatures (BAUp. 1,4,15(end)-16), worlds penetrated by the thunder-
spoken qualities of dama, dana*, and daya*control, giving, and compassion (BAUp. 5,2,1-3)- There is also what
Hajime Nakamura calls a "fondness for negative expression."1 The central negative virtue is ahimsa*, "non-
harming" or "nonkilling." With these qualities, the Upanisads* introduce the new idea of "universal virtues,"
sadharana* dharmas, virtues applying to all "worlds." Such trends may certainly be identified as post-Brahmanic*.
As P. V. Kane says, "The reason for cultivating such virtues as daya*, ahimsa* is based upon the philosophical
doctrine of the Self."2 Thus even knowledge and truth (satya) are virtues which come to have special Upanisadic*
significance.
These tendencies have their parallels and counterparts in Buddhism;3 the influences of these two traditions have
combined with a popular acceptance of yoga to produce what we could call a yogic expansion of epic virtues. This
appears in certain passages of counsel, which range from the sententious and commonplace to the subtle and
sublime. Vidura, for

instance, tells Dhrtarastra *: "Truly, these six gunas* should not be forsaken by any man: truth, giving, nonidleness
[analasyam*], nonenvy [anasuya*], forbearance, and firmness" (5:33,69). In what is probably the most inflated
passage in the epic, Bhisma* tells Yudhisthira* that proper royal conduct involves "thirty-six virtues [gunas*]
related to thirty-six other virtues; accomplishing those virtues [gunan*], one possessed of virtues [gunopeta*]
should obtain merit [gunam*]" (12:71,2). The list is an incoherent mélange.
Also showing a yogic influence is a process of infinitization of virtues. Certain figuresArjuna (5:94,41) and Karna*
(1:126,5), Krishna* (5:94,36-41; 7:10,39) and Asvatthaman* (5:164,10)are said to have "uncountable virtues"
(asamkhyeyaguna* or the equivalent). This tendency seems to imply a yogic definition of these heroes' theological
identities. In the cases of Krishna and Asvatthaman*, such terminology describes the figures who incarnate Visnu-
Naryana* and Siva*. Similarly, Arjuna benefits from such an assessment where he is identified as the incarnation
of Nara. Thus when Parasurama* tells how Nara and Narayana* humiliated the tyrant Dambhodbhava (5:94,29-
41), he comments: "Very great was that feat achieved of old by Nara; [but] Narayana* then became superior in
consequence of his many more virtues [or qualities]" (gunaih* subahubhih* srestha*; 36). And, with transparent
but also transcendental logic, he adds: "Countless are the virtues of Partha* [Arjuna-Nara], [but] superior to him is
Janardana*" (asamkhyeya* gunah* parthe tadvisisto* janardanah*; 41). Elsewhere tit is said that in Krishna "there
exists an abundance of virtues forever" (guna-sampat-sada-eva*; 5:47,81), and it seems likely that these
descriptions refer not only to ascetic merits but to the doctrine of Saguna* Brahman, "brahman with qualities."4
4 This does not mean that all theological formulations run to infinity. One can think of the "six powers" or
"shares" (bhaga) of Visnu-Krishna* as represented in VP 6,5,74-76: lordship (aisvaryam*), dharma,
yasas*, sri*, knowledge (jnana*), and nonattachment (vairagyam*); see Alain Danielou, Hindu Polytheism
(London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1964), p. 36.

These inflationary processes in the epic are particularly apparent in descriptions of the Pandavas *, whose basic
trifunctional character, as a group, need not be doubted. In recalling her sons, for instance, Kunti*, along with
evoking such functional traits as Yudhisthira's* truth and virtue, Bhima's* strength and speed, Arjuna's prowess,
Sahadeva's obedience and youth, and Nakula's beauty and taste for comfort, also praises the Pandavas* for such
Upanisadic* qualities as restraint (Yudhisthira* and Arjuna), compassion (Yudhisthira* and Sahadeva), patience
(Arjuna), and modesty (Sahadeva; 5:88,18-41).
The Pandavas*, however, bring us closer to the epic's central dharmic concepts: a phrase which will bear some
explanation. As the Mahabharata* tells of a struggle for sovereignty (the Pandavas* being former Indras), it is
natural that the virtues of royalty are a central dharmic issue. So it is on many planes: in exhortatory enumerations
of virtues, in discursive teachings like the Rajadharma* section of the Santiparvan*, and in various narrative
ramifications. I do not mean that other ethical concepts found in the epic are necessarily peripheral or that they are
unrelated to the royal virtues; but they must not be confused with them. One will think especially of the four
Purusarthas*, "aims of human life," and the various virtues or duties ascribed to the four varnas*. In both cases the
Pandavas* are bound up with these classifications, and there is no question of regarding them as noncentral to the
epic's ethical content. However, none of these sets of "virtues" can be reduced to any other. Dumézil has shown
how the themes of dharma, artha, and kama* are articulated through the structure of the Pandavas*;5 but this is not
because these Purusarthas* serve to define the Pandavas* in relationship to the three functions or to kingship.
As to caste, it is a special duty of the kingwhich Krishna says Yudhisthira* will fulfill (5:29,20-24)to protect the
four orders and stimulate them to fulfill their "duties." But royal

virtues and caste duties are not interchangeable. In fact, the systematization of particular virtues for each caste
seems to have been a gradual process. When Bhisma * defends Krishna's right to the highest honors in the
Sisupala* episode, he cites Krishna's many gunas* (2:35,12), and in particular his knowledge and immeasurable
strength (18). In contrast, he says, others deserve honor only for single virtues: brahmins for knowledge (jnana*)
and ksatriyas* for strength (balam; 17). As an indication that the varnas* supply only a loose model for classifying
virtues, numerous manuscripts interpolate an honor due to vaisyas* for being "rich in wealth" (dhanyadhanavat*)
and to sudras* according to their age (janmatas; 2,357*). Similarly, a relatively broad rearrangement of traditional
ethical material seems to lie behind Bhagavad Gita* 18, 42-44, where Krishna describes the "natural-born actions"
(karma svabhavajam) that are "distinguished according to the Strands [gunas*] that spring from the innate nature"
of the four varnas* (18, 41-42). In this passage, it is only the last two classes that have actual "actions" attributed
to them: agriculture, cattle tending, commerce (vaisyas*), and service (sudras*; 18, 44). In contrast, the first two
classes have virtues. In fact, several of the qualities attributed to ksatriyas*tejas, sauryam* ("heroism"), danam*
("generosity"; 18,43)are ones which are elsewhere used in trifunctional lists to emphasize royalty. And the various
Upanisadic* and yogic qualitiescalm, (self-)control (dama), austerities (tapas), patienceare for the most part
attributed to brahmins (41). Such considerations make it extremely unlikely that the caste system, at least in its
Indian form, could have served as the model for the classification of the royal virtues. This is not to say that the
variety of formulas expressing royal qualities has not been continually reinforced by the caste system. But the
conceptual or ideological structure cannot be reduced to the social structure.6
6 This crucial methodological point is also made by Dumézil in ME, I, 15.

In relation to this last passage, by central dharmic teachings, I also do not exclude the emphasis on action, karman,
which finds its fullest expression in the Gita *. This doctrine, which has a long prehistory, has also been
transformed in the epic by yoga; and it finds its most fitting disciple and exemplar in the person not of the king,
but of the warrior-yogi Arjuna.7 Thus, whereas it is Yudhisthira's* royal duty to balance every virtue and weigh
every action, his ksatriya* mother and wife, and Krishna and Arjuna as well, can rebuke him for his often
exasperating indecision. The warrior Arjuna can say to the king: "Even abandoned by every virtue [sarvairapi
gunairhino*], one possessed of heroism [viryam*] may overcome his foes; even united with every virtue, without
heroism [nirviryah*], what will one do? Surely, in prowess [parakrame*] all the virtues exist in an elemental
state" (2:15,9-10ab). Action, or heroism (viryam*, sauryam*cf. Gita* 18, 43), springs essentially from the
warrior's nature. But for the king it must be integrated among qualities of other dimensions.
"All the Virtues"
In speaking of the epic's central ethical or dharmic focus, I am thus addressing a concern which relates to, and
extends into, all the areas just discussed, but which carries along the main thrust of the narrative: the "just" claim to
sovereignty of Yudhisthira*, the Dharmaraja*, son and "King of Dharma."8 In this and the next three chapters, I
will try to show that to appreciate Yudhisthira's* dramatic role, one must look beyond the passages that describe his
virtues in basically yogic or Upanisadic* terms.
7 See above, Chapter 6 at n. 2, and Biardeau, Clefs, p. 95, using the term "guerrier yogin."
8 Biardeau, Clefs, p. 96, prefers the translation "roi-dharma" to "roi du dharma," as also, apparently, does van
Buitenen, who refers to "King Dharma" in "The Sabhaparvan*," p. 70.

Foregoing discussions have made it clear that one of the key formulas connected with royal virtues is the one that
describes a person as "endowed with all the virtues" (such as sarvagunopeta *, sarvagunasampanna*,
sarvadharmopapanna). It is a phrase used frequently with reference to Yudhisthira*, especially in contexts which
have to do with his fitness to be king. Thus we have seen it when Dharma, having shed his Yaksa* disguise,
promises Yudhisthira* he shall have more than just the specific qualities he requests.9 And most important, it
occurs when Krishna, invited to Indraprastha to advise Yudhisthira* on whether to perform the Rajasuya*, declares
his support of Yudhisthira* for the title of samraj*, "universal monarch," because he is endowed with "every
virtue" (sarvairgunair*; 2:13,1; cf. 30, 23).
It is curious that these epithets, which concern moral wholeness, are sometimes interchangeable with another mode
of distinguishing excellence. Note the following parallelism. In the passage discussed in the last section in which
Kunti* describes the Pandavas*, she refers to Yudhisthira* as a king "endowed with every virtue, who should even
be the king of the triple world" (raja* sarvagunopetastrailokyasyapi* yo bhavet; 5:88,21). Similarly, Vidura says
he is a king "endowed with laksanas*, who should even be the king of the triple world" (raja*
laksanasampannastrailokyasyapi* yo bhavet; 5: 34,81). By the substitution of one formula for the other, virtues are
interchangeable with "physical marks." The Mahabharata* does not tell a great deal about Yudhisthira's* physical
features, other than that he is light-complexioned,10 of "prominent" or "formidable nose" (pracandaghona*;
3:254,7: cf. 1:180,20; 15:32,5), and large-armed (pinabahu*; 3:118,10). At least in the latter case, the mark is
probably royal.11 In other cases,

however, physical marks and moral excellences clearly seem to complement each other. Krishna, for instance, is
described as sarvagunasampannam * srivatsakrtalaksanam*, "endowed with every virtue and having the mark
made by the Srivatsa*" on his breast (5:81,36). And Karna* is a "tiger of the splendor of the Sun, marked by every
divine mark [divyalaksanalaksita*], with earrings and armor" (1:127,15), whose death Yudhisthira* mourns by
saying, "born of Surya*, endowed with every virtue (sarvagunopeta*), formerly cast in the water" (12:1,22). Such
a duplicate way of distinguishing a "great man," especially a "king of dharma," iswith little stretching of the
termalso found in Buddhism, where the Buddha is recognized both by his thirty-two major and eighty subsidiary
laksanas* and by his perfection in the six paramitas*.12 No doubt such double characterizations are very ancient.
One is reminded of Angelo Brelich's discussion of the "moral and physical monstrosities" of the Greek heroes.13 It
would seem, at least from Indian examples, that the two types of disfigurations are balanced by combinations of
"moral and physical perfections."
There is, then, a notion of wholeness, soundness, or perfection which includes both the physical and moral
dimensions of certain epic characters. Moreover, at least with regard to the moral dimension, the epic clearly uses
the phrase "endowed with all the virtues" almost exclusively with reference to royalty. First, regarding dynasties,
Krishna can tell Dhrtarastra* that the Kuru family line (kulam) is "today the best among all royal dynasties,
furnished with knowledge and [good] behavior [vrttam*] and endowed with all the virtues" (sarvaih* samuditam*
gunaih*; 5:93,5). Similarly, according to the opening of the Adiparyan*, royal races are endowed with virtues
(mahatsu rajavamsesu* gunaih* samuditesu*; 1:1,164), while the virtues of their kings are celebrated in puranas*
(legends "of old") by the most venerable kavis or bards (1:1,181-2). Nearly all the main

figures through whom the Kuru line is perpetuated are at one point or another given this accolade. Among the line's
ancestors are Yayati * (5:120,18) and his sons (thus including his successor Puru*; I:70,31), and probably Bharata
(gunopeta*; 1:68,2). Within the context of the epic's dynastic crises are Bhisma* (12:50,28-29; cf. 1:93,44-45) and
Karna* (12:1,22), both of whom are potential Kuru kings; Yudhisthira*, the Pandavas* as a group (all "Indras
among men"; 5:35,67;89,2614), Abhimanyu (7:33,8-10), and Pariksit* (1:45, 14). In this second cluster, the only
"royal" omissions seem (barring oversights) to be Pandu* and Dhrtarastra*; and this may be significant, as these
two are the only ones marked by physical defects: their paleness and blindness.
Outside of royal usages, the phrase seems rare. The only instances I have observed in the epic concern
Janamejaya's snake sacrifice (1:49,26), various species of birds (1:60,57), Kubera's horses (3:158,24), and
Brahma* (8:24,105). As to those who are not kings or potential heirs, but whose virtues are praised, it is notable
that the terms usually differ. Vidura, for instance, is frequently sarvadharmavid, "knowledgeable about every
virtue" (see 1:126,28; 133,18), in his role as an expositor of dharma. But the virtues are his to recognize rather than
to possess.
The link with royalty obviously does not pertain solely to the males. As we saw in the last chapter and shall stress
again, the notion of "all the virtues" is connected with Draupadi*. Kunti* too is omnivirtuous in a way that bears
upon her royal status. As Krishna says, consoling her in her knowledge that her sonsKarna* and the Pandavas*will
engage in mortal combat:
What hair-parter [woman] is there like you in the lokas, O aunt, daughter of an heroic king, admitted [by
marriage] to the race of
14 Also, see above, Chapter 7, at n. 67, citing 1:157,10 and 189,43 (Pandavas* in overanxious maiden
story) and 189,38 (myth of the five Indras).

Ajamidha *, high-born, highly married, transplated [like a lotus] from lake to lake, all-auspicious mistress
[isvari* sarvakalyani*], adored by your husband, hero-bearing and wife of a hero [virasur-virapatni*],
endowed with every virtue [sarvaih* samudita* gunaih*], endowed with great wisdom, it behoves you to
bear both joy and sorrow. [5:88,90-92]
Similarly, one finds "all the virtues" in Sakuntala* (1:68,10), and again, within the context of the dynastic crisis,
not only in Draupadi* and Kunti*, but in Satyavati* (1:57,54), and in Amba*, Ambika*, and Ambalika* (1:96,45).
Thus from Satyavati* on, nearly all the women brought into the dynastic linethe only exceptions appear to be
Madri* and Uttara*come with a full complement of virtues. Finally, outside the dynasty, the story of Nala and
Damayanti* provides a close parallel. Just as Nala is "possessed of the desirable virtues" (upapanno gunairistaih*;
3:50,1), Damayanti* "became celebrated throughout the world for her beauty [rupam*], majesty [tejas], fame
[yasas*], prosperity [sri*], and good fortune" (saubhagyam; 3:50,10). In fact, "repeatedly hearing of each other's
virtues [gunan*], they conceived for each other an attachment not born of sight" (adrstakamo*; 50,16).15 The
virtues, then, are at the core of the narrative and remain there as a theme throughout.
It is thus apparent that the royal virtues must be found in full in both sexes. Only where the virtues of a lineage are
found in its brides can there be a guarantee of omnivirtuous heirs. When disruptions and crises occur, the epic
seems to suggest two possible solutions. One is to call upon gods, or incarnations of gods, to sire suitable sons. The
other, which will occupy us now, is to find some sort of intermediary, some special figure whose function it is to
provide a mechanism whereby the difficulties, whatever they are, can be overcome.

Dillon, "The Archaism of the Irish Tradition," Reprints from the American Committee for Irish Studies
(1947; University of Chicago reprint, 1969), pp. 11-12.

The Royal Virtues and the Three Functions
Although the phrase "endowed with every virtue" is primarily a royal epithet, the epic never explains this termnot
even in the Rajadharma * section of the Santiparvan*by any list, long or short, of particular virtues. One is thus
left to the task of reconstruction.
The material will not allow one to insist that any single set of individual virtues forms the original "endowment."
There are too many combinations. First, the various processes of "inflation" have created many new virtues and
changed the meanings of others. Second, if one assumes a basic structure rather than an original combination,
variations within and upon that structure would naturally be expected.
Although a number of authors have dealt with particular virtues,16 only Dumézil has examined the tendency to
group them in significant combinations. Gonda in particular has shown a reluctance to deal with any more than one
"power substance" at a time.17 Let us now attempt an overview of such combinations as they occur in the epic in
connection with royalty. Thanks to Dumézil's study,18 King Yayati*
16 For Gonda's discussion of "power substances," see above, Chapter 7, n. 28, and his "Gods" and
"Powers," pp. 43 -44,58-62; also idem, Ancient-Indian ojas, Latin *augos and the Indo-European Nouns -
es/-os (Utrecht: A. Oosthoek's Uitgevers Mij., 1952). On satya, "truth," see most recently W. Norman
Brown, "Duty as Truth in Ancient India," PAPS, CXVI (1972), 252-68, with bibliography, p. 252, n. 1; also
Lévi, Doctrine du sacrifice, pp. 114, 163-67, and Dumézil, ME, II, 289-91. On tejas, see Biardeau, EPHE,
LXXIX, 145. For other terms and further discussion, see below.
17 Gonda attributes the instances of "triads relevant to one of the three functions" to no more than a "stylistic
tendency" ("Some Observations on Dumézil's View of Indo-European Mythology," Mnemosyne, IV [1960], 7-
8). Thus he overlooks possible trifunctional features of some of the passages he cites, such as: "If a man's
sacrificial post sprouts leaves his tejas, indriyam, viryam*, food, children, and cattle recede from him" (PB
9,10,7; see "Gods" and "Powers," p. 60).

emerges, along with the other characters in his legend, as the figure most indispensable to the discussion.
Although Yayati * is only the fifth or sixth member of the Lunar Dynasty (of which Kuru will be a later member),
Dumézil shows that he is an example, perhaps India's earliest, of what Arthur Christensen was the first to designate
as a "first king."19 Kings of this "type" are involved with the origins of institutions, in particular with the partition
of the earth (which in one episode of his story Yayati* distributes among his five sons), with the establishment of
the central line of succession (which Yayati*, in the same episode, allots to his loyal son Puru*), and with the
foundation of the social classes. In Yayati's* case, in the second part of his legend, his rapport is not so much with
the classes, or with their origin (the Purusa* Sukta* accounts for this), as with the royal virtues that a king must
have to epitomize the qualities needed for the proper working of all the classes and of society as a whole.
Let us now summarize some features of Dumézil's study. The second part of Yayati's* story concerns his daughter
Madhavi* (who figures in a most compelling comparison) and, through her, his four grandsons. Madhavi's* name
is equivalent to that of the Irish heroine (or heroines, there being two of them) called Medb, meaning, in both
cases, "the Intoxicating."20 Both princesses are daughters of the "central" or "high" king of their lands. Moreover,
there is a sequence in the stories of Madhavi* and Medb of Connacht where each marries four kings in turn and
thereby assures that a certain set of virtues is perpetuated. Not unlike Sri*,21 Medb of Connacht sets up a
requirement that each suitor, and thus rival for the

central sovereignty which she bestows, must be "without jealousy, without fear, and without niggardliness,"22 or,
in other words, he must be just,23 brave, and generous. Medb displays these qualities herself24 and apparently
finds them though not for longin each of her successive husbands. With Madhavi *, the tale of the virtues concerns
not her husbands so much as the sons she has by them, ultimately for her father. But the Indo-Irish comparisons do
not end here. Medb of Connacht has a sister, perhaps a double, named Clothru, and she has a son who, like
Madhavi's* four, is born apparently for her royal father's sake. His name is Lugaid-Red-Stripes, his body divided
by stripes into three zones, suggesting the possibility that he was in origin a representative of the synthesis of the
three functions.25
However one takes this last point, the main substance of Dumézil's comparison shows at least that the story of
Yayati*, Madhavi*, and the latter's four sons is an Indian version of an extremely old legend. It is important
enough to summarize it as it bears upon the question of the royal virtues.26 Reputed to have fabulous wealth
(dhanam; 5:112,2), Yayati* is approached by a brahmin named Galava* who has incurred an imposing debt to his
guru Visvamitra*. He must bring his
22 See Dumézil, ME, II, 337-38; Rees and Rees, Celtic Heritage, pp. 130-31; and Thomas Kinsella, trans.,
The Tain (London: Oxford University Press, 1970), P. 53; see also above, Chapter 1, nn. 29 and 30.
23 For the trifunctional interpretation, approvingly quoted by Dumézil (ME, II, 337-38), see Rees and Rees,
Celtic Heritage, pp. 130-31: jealousy, the only problem, is interpreted as the vice opposed to the administration
of royal justice. In support of this interpretation, see also ME, II, 339, on Medb's ability to maintain
order"without jealousy!"among the fifteen hundred princes who form her entourage.
24 Dumézil, ME, II, 339.
25Ibid., pp. 350-53.
26 The text of this portion of the Yayati* legend is found at Mbh. 5:104-21. The story of Yayati* and his sons,
plus another version of the rescue by his grandsons, is found at 1:71-88; in this latter text, Madhavi* is not
mentioned.

master eight hundred horses, all lunar white and each with one black ear. Yayati * doesn't have the horses and his
wealth has diminished; but he cannot refuse to give alms.
"Therefore," he says, "take this daughter of mine, one who causes four lineages to stand, this one
resembling a child of the gods, a promptress of every virtue, always sought after by Gods, men, and
Asuras."

iyam* surasutaprakhya* sarvadharmopacayini*

These words present a curiosity which I will return to. For the moment, Galava* is assured that the princess is
worth far more than what he needs and sets off with her to obtain the horses.
Galava* first takes Madhavi* to King Haryasva* of Ayodhya* and offers her to him for the bride price of the eight
hundred horses. This king, however, has only two hundred, which he will gladly exchange for the opportunity of
having Madhavi* bear him a single son. Ever compliant but rarely assertive, Madhavi* for once interrupts: in her
youth, a brahmin had granted her the boon of retaining her virginity after childbirths; she can thus make up the sum
of eight hundred horses by bearing sons to four kings in succession (5:114, 10-13). Her offer is accepted, and
although it turns out that only six hundred of the horses are still in existence, Galava's* guru, none other than the
royal ksatriya*-turned-brahmin Visvamitra*, agrees to accept Madhavi* in lieu of the full payment so that he can
father the fourth child himself. Galava* finally receives her back, a virgin for the fourth time, and as he returns her
to Yayati*, his words to her yield what Dumézil has called the "trifunctional key" to the story:27 "To you is born a
son who is a lord of gifts [danapati*], another who is a hero [sura*],

another devoted to truth and virtue [satyadharmarata], and yet another who is a great sacrificer [yajvan]. Now go,
O excellent woman, by these sons your father is saved [taritas *], as also four kings, and myself" (117,21-22).
Madhavi* passes from the scene for a while, choosing the Forest (vana, masc.; 118,5) as her final husband and
adopting, as was mentioned in the last chapter, the peculiar ascetic mode of life of the "deer-farer" (mrgacarini*;
118,7). The stage is again Yayati's*, and from here on, the Adiparvan* and Udyogaparvan present parallel, but
varying accounts. Yayati* has ascended to heaven, where he dwells as a rajarsi*. There he is sustained, according
to the Adiparvan*, because for thousands of years he had amassed virtues in areas that correspond to the three
functions: truth, conquests, and gifts (1:88,21-24).28 One day, due to an outburst of pride, he is expelled. By good
fortune, however, he is able to guide his fall toward the spot where his four grandsons are performing a Vajapeya*
sacrifice. Withholding his identity, Yayati* tells them that he has fallen from heaven because of the loss of his
merits (punya*; 5:119,7), and, together, the four grandsonseach now a king in his own rightmake the following
offer: "From all of us [sarvesam* nah*] ... [take] the fruit of our sacrifices and our virtue" (kratuphalam*
dharmasca*; 5:119,18). Yayati* at first demurs but is soon persuaded, in the Adiparvan* by the sudden appearance
of five celestial chariots which arrive to take him and his grandsons to heaven,29 in the Udyogaparvan by the
reappearance of Madhavi* and Galava* who offer, in addition to the merits of the grandsons, one-half and one-
eighth of their own. Yayati* is thus refurnished. In the Udyogaparvan, "adorned with virtues" (gunopeta*; 120,2),
his course is turned around. He reascends to heaven, propelled by the transparently trifunctional words of his
grandsons.

First to speak is the youngest, Vasumanas, the "lord of gifts" (danapati *; 12,3),30 who offers Yayati* "whatever
fruit comes from the conduct of giving" (danasila*) and the fruit also of his "patience" and "depositing" (adhana*;
120,4-5). Second, Pratardana, "that bull among ksatriyas*," "devoted to battle" (yuddhaparayanah*), says Yayati*
may have whatever "fame" (yasas*) has attached to his "virtue of power" (ksatradharma*) and whatever fruit
attaches to the word "hero" (vira*; 6-7). Third, the "intelligent" (dhiman*) Sibi*, citing his own infallible truth, his
own allegiance to truth, and the truth that the gods Dharma, Agni, and Indra are near to him, intones three times
(one for each of the "verifications"), with a "sweet invocation" (madhuram* giram): "by that truth ascend to
heaven" (tena satyena kham* vraja; 8-11). And finally Astaka*, knowledgable about dharma (dharmavid), offers
the fruit of his thousands of sacrifices (kratavah*) and adds, citing the truth that nothing has been spared in these
ceremonies: "by that truth [tena satyena] ascend to heaven" (13-14). Then speaking jointly to consolidate their gifts
into a synthesis, the four utter a formula now familiar, showing that together the virtues they have offered
constitute a totality:
Endowed with the attributes of royal virtue, possessed of every virtue and attribute,
We are your daughter's sons, O king. Ascend to heaven, O lord of earth.

30 Dumézil, ME, II, 273, argues, I think convincingly, that while in the epic "giving" denotes generosity
with alms, it probably has its "essence" in the more basic notion of "wealth" which he connects with the
third function. Given such a transformation, the epic meaning would seem to reflect an Upanisadic* (or
perhaps Buddhist) re-evaluation; dana* is also praised in the Rg* Veda: see Nakamura, Ways of Thinking,
p. 84. On the element vasu- in the name connoting "material goods," see ME, II, 273.

The grandsons' offerings are in close accord with the virtues mentioned in the "trifunctional key." Certain
difficulties pertain to the virtues of the first function, which is represented doubly, but in a combination different
from pairings found elsewhere in Indian divisions of the first function. Second, Dumézil has remarked that Astaka's
* closing words"by that truth ascend to heaven"are borrowed "against our expectation" from the "truthful" Sibi*.
Dumézil attempts to resolve this problem by detaching satya ("truth") from the other virtues: "We have before us
the merits of the three functions and, above them, the more important merits of veracity, the absence of lying." He
sees the importance of this dominant virtue as deriving from an Indo-Iranian concept, one with its roots well
displayed in the Yayati* legend and its partial Iranian counterpart, the lgend of Yima. This is the opposition
rta*/druh*, asha (arta)/druj, that is, between the "arranged" and "ordered" truth and the lie.31
This ancient notion of "truth" is no doubt at play in the Yayati* story, but insofar as satya is used in this present
scene, it has a more immediate, although perhaps even more ancient, significance. Satya operates on two levels. In
terms of identifying Sibi*, it is his special virtue and thus a first-function virtue in its own right. But in the phrase
tena satyena, "by that truth," it operates as what W. Norman Brown and others have called an "Act of Truth.32 In
brief, an "act of truth" can reverse the law of karman and reverse natural processes. But it can be performed only
by that rare being,
whether deity or man, who does his duty perfectly, that is, fulfills his obligations under the Rta*.... Such a
being may be said to be
31 Dumézil, ME, II, 274-92; quotes at pp. 279 and 290. From this standpoint, pride (Yayati's* sin) is a form
of lying (Yima's sin), of denying the true order of things.

satyá (adjective) "true" or to have satyÿm (neuter noun) "Truth." He is ánuvrata "true to duty" and is rtavan
* ["observing or conserving the Rta*"] or satyádharman "having Truth as his principle." ... When a person
fulfills his duty perfectly, he gains this power; for he has observed the Rta*, has met his obligations under
it. He is one with the Sat; he is satya, that is, true in a complete sense and can "control" the Sat, for he and
the Sat are one.33
On the point under question, Brown remarks that "this phrase (tena satyena) is a common formulaic item in the
Act of Truth." And, as an indication of its antiquity and diffusion, he is able to cite examples from the Rg* Veda
(1:21,5), from the story of Nala and Damayanti*, and from Buddhist literature.34 In fact, as we shall see shortly,
the Mahabharata* supplies another instance, a far more pivotal one, of the use of this formula, again relating an
"act of truth" to an assortment of significant virtues and acts. So it seems that satya, in its epic contexts, must be
viewed as both a virtue and a quality which can put other virtues or "duties" into effect. Thus, whereas Astaka*
cites the truth of his perseverence in sacrifices, Sibi* can cite the truth of his truthfulness.
The Yayati* legend thus provides the clearest, and probably the oldest, narrative on the composition of a full
assemblage of royal virtues. Representing "all the virtues," the identities and the donations of the four grandsons
are structured according to the three functions. Once again, let us reiterate that the structure is more basic than any
one set of royal qualities, as can be seen in other texts which describe Yayati*. His legend has given him wide
recognition as an exemplar of royal qualities. In one case, Somadatta (a brother of the Pandavas'* great grandfather
Samtanu*) is described as an "old man thriving with every virtue [vrddhamrddham* gunaih* sarvair], like
Yayati*, son of Nahusa*" (7:132,6). More specifically, a

trifunctional structure may sometimes be discerned in references to Yayati *. In a passage from Asvaghosa's*
Buddhacarita (2,11) mentioned by Dumézil,35 the virtues that flourished in the realm of King Suddhodana at the
time of his son Siddhartha's* birth are identified with those that thrived in the model kingdom of Yayati*: "At that
time in his realm, as in that of King Yayati* son of Nahusa*, no one was disrespectful toward kinsmen
[nagauravo* bandhusu*], nor ungenerous [na ... adata*], nor unobservant of religious obligations [na ... avrato],
nor untruthful [na ... anrtiko*], nor given to hurt [na himsrah*]."36 Although these are society's virtues rather than
the king's, and although they are not given consecutively, one may still propose that a trifunctional complement of
royal virtues provided the model: (first function) observance of obligations and truthfulness (cf. Astaka* and
Sibi*); (second) noncruelty, feasibly a Buddhist reformulation of the warrior function; and (third) generosity (cf.
Vasumanas) and perhaps respect for kinsmen.37 Finally, again from the Mahabharata*, one finds Samjaya* trying
to instill in Dhrtarastra* the fortitude to bear the bad news of battle by recalling the ancient rajarsi's* example:
In prosperity, lineage, fame, asceticism, and learning, the good now regard you to be like Yayati*, son of
Nahusa*.
sriya* kulena yasasa* tapasa* ca srutena* ca
tvamadya* santo manyante yayatimiva* nahusam*. [8:5,27]
Here, in ascendant order, is the third-function quality "prosperity" along with "family, lineage," the latter being a
virtue (cf. "respect for kinsmen" in the Buddhacarita) that will demand further discussion; then "fame, glory," the
ksatriya's* great
35 Dumézil, ME, II, 360; he does not suggest a trifunctional interpretation here.

37 "Respectfulness" is a Vaisya* trait sometimes identified with Nakula and/or Sahadeva (for example,
7:33,6); see Wikander, "Nakula et Sahadeva," OS, VI (1957), 70.

aspiration; and finally two matters of spirit and mind, tapas and learning.
Yayati's * legend and renown thus give an excellent base from which to seek a wider sample of royal virtue
inventories. In addition to those which, in the last chapter, we found connected with Sri* and Draupadi*, there are
the following. First is a passage which requires treatment at some length and then a number of passages which can
be summarized.
The culminating scene in Krishna's participation in the affairs of the Pandavas* and Kurus is his revival of the
royal baby Pariksit*, son of Abhimanyu. Krishna's role involves an activation of certain virtues. Should Pariksit*
remain stillborn, the Kuru line will have ended. But Krishna has promised to revive the child (10:16,15) and is
reminded of this by his sister Subhadra*, the dead child's grandmother. Her words are almost as significant a "key"
as those of Galava* to Madhavi*: "Surely, O Kesava*, you have a soul of dharma [dharmatma*], are truthful
[satyavan*], and have true valor [satyavikramah*]. It [behoves] you to make this word [his promise] conform to
rta*" (tam* vacamrtam*; 14:66,16). The virtues which Subhadra* attributes to her brother thus range themselves
within the first and second functions: (1) dharma and satya; and (2) true or real valor, vikrama. And we soon see
that she knows him well, for it is these qualities, and actions related to them, that Krishna makes operative in the
miracle that follows. He "withdraws" (sam-hr*; 14:68,16) the weapon that afflicts the child, and then, "causing the
entire universe to hear" (sarvam* visravayanjagat*; 17), he says:
18. I do not speak falsely [na bravimy* ... mithya*"], O Uttara*; it shall be true [satyametadbhavisyati]: I
shall cause this one to live in the sight of all embodied creatures [pasyatam* sarvadehinam*].
19. Never before has anything been spoken falsely [mithya*] by me, even in indifferent matters; and I have
never turned back in battle [na ca yuddhe paravrttas*]; accordingly, may this one live [tatha*
samjivatamayam*].

20. As dharma and brahmins above all [brahmanasca * visesatah*] are dear to me, may this son of
Abhimanyu, born dead, live accordingly [tatha*].
21. As I have never brought about hostility [virodha] with Vijaya [Arjuna], by that truth [tena satyena] may
this child live.
22. As satya and dharma are forever established in me, accordingly [tatha*] let this dead child born of
Abhimanyu live.
23. Kamsa* and Kesin* were righteously [dharmena] slain by me, by that truth [tena satyena] let this child
return to lift. [14:68,18-23]
Through these words the child comes to life (24).
There is, as one can see, a cadence here. After summoning his truthfulness (sloka* 18), Krishna alternates between
calling upon his second-function and first-function qualities. In slokas* 19, 21, and 23, he mentions virtues relative
to his career as a ksatriya* prince: he has "never turned back in battle," he has "never brought about hostility" with
his inseparable friend Arjuna, and he has "righteously" slain his foes Kamsa* and Kesin*. On the other hand, in
slokas* 20 and 22, Krishna mentions his affinities with dharma and brahmins and then with dharma and satya.
Satya operates on the same double level as in the story of Yayati*. It is one of Krishna's virtues, yet it also serves
as the basis for an "act of truth."38 Moreover, the "act of truth" itself involves not the first-function qualities but
the second. In sloka* 19, Krishna's never having "turned back in battle" is substantiated, activated, by his never
having spoken falsely. And then, all the more pointedly, in the last two "second-function slokas*" Krishna activates
his relation with Arjuna and his "righteous" conquests by the "common formulaic item" tena satyena (slokas* 21
and 23). Let us now recall the words of Subhadra*, according to whom Krishna has satya, dharma, and true valor
as the virtues relevant to his promise.
38 Dhairyabala P. Vora, Evolution of Morals in the Epics (Bombay: Bhatkal, 1959), P. 219, observes
correctly that "Krsna* revives the still born child ... by the power of his truthful character." I would only
add that "truth," though basic, is not the only quality involved.

By "valor" especially, or more precisely by the related second-function achievements, Krishna is able to put his
"truth" into "action." His word thus "conforms to rta *."
It will not do, however, to say that Krishna uses only his second-function traits in this act of truth. Perhaps the
formula tena satyena occurs on this level because his second-function achievements, some of them rather
ambiguous, must be "verified" (tena satyena) and "justified" (dharmena) by the virtues of the first function.
Actually, the whole speech constitutes the act of truth. Rather than drawing from one dimension, Krishna draws on
at least two, more or less in the same fashion as the grandsons of Yayati* draw on all three functional areas. From
these two cases, it would seem that an act of truth involving the destiny of a king requires the activation of virtues
from each of the three functions. Yet it must be admitted that Krishna makes no mention of any virtue or activity
that has reference to the third function. For the present, this problem must be left unsolved.
More briefly, other enumerations of royal virtues include the following:
(1) In Chapter 10, I will attempt to show that Salya*, king of Madra, is a special symbolic representative of
kingship. When he is nominated to lead the Kuru army, it is with this royal character clearly in mind: "This one,
with [his] lineage [kulam], heroism [viryam*], energy [tejas], fame [yasas*], and prosperity [sri*], is endowed
with every virtue" (sarvagunair* samuditah*; 9:5,18).39
(2) Opposite this, when Salya* is slain by Yudhisthira*, the latter's troops acclaim him "firm in truth [satyadhrti*],
one whose foes are conquered [jitamitra*]; today [with Salya's* death] King Duryodhana has been divested of
blazing royal prosperity" (hino diptaya* nrpatisriya*; 9:18,14).
39 The ordering of these virtues is apparently pyramidical, with tejas, first function, at top center (head?),
viryam* and yadas* at the sides (arms?), and kulam and sri* suggestively at the base.

(3) Bhisma *, having fallen in battle and lying on his bed of arrows, urges Karna*, whom he had till then always
degraded, to unite with the Pandavas* and end hostilities: "I know your vigor [viryam*] in battle, so hard for foes
to bear, your regard for brahmins [or piety; brahmanyata*], your heroism [sauryam*], and your superior conduct
in giving" (dane* ca paramam* gatim; 6:117,12). The last three qualities remind us that Karna*, like Bhisma*
himself, is a potential king.
(4) When Bhisma* introduces Yudhisthira* to the subject of rajadharma*, the "duty of kings," he begins by
breaking the subject down into four topics: attendance on gods and brahmins, truth (satya) exertion (utthana*), and
the maintenance of prosperity (sri*; 12:56,12-20).
(5) At a point where Arjuna's identity, as father of Abhimanyu and grandfather of Pariksit*, is defined by his role
in continuing the Kuru line with its virtues intact, he is prised trifunctionally: for his "learning [srutam*], prowess
[vikrama*], and prosperity" (sri*; 7:33,10).
(6) Pariksit* is himself celebrated as "prosperous, truth-speaking, and of firm fortitude" (sriman-satyavag-
drdhavikramah*; 1:45,11).
(7) Then there is a formulaic sloka* describing the ideal king, occurring twice with only the slightest variation:
"Having obtained kingship, a virtuous [monarch] should win over some by gift, some by might, and others by
sweet speech" (danenanyam* balenanyam* tatha* sunrtayaparam* [or anyam* sunrtaya* gira*]; 5: 130,27 and,
variant in brackets, 12:76,31).40
(8) Paralleling this royal program in a more active form, we are told that "Three sounds never ceased in the abode
of [King] Dilipa*: the sound of [Vedic] recitation, the sound of the bowstring, and the words 'let it be given'"
(diyatam*; 12:29,72).
40Sunrta* as a substantive, or sunrta* gir, where it is used adjectivally, may evoke a derivation from su-
rta*, "good and true" (Monier-Williams). As the next citation (no. 8) shows, it probably evokes the sound
of Vedic recitation.

(9) To these descriptions of kings should now be added one concerning a queen. Having notices in Chapter 7 that a
trifunctional characterization of Draupadi * placed her third-function trait, rupam* ("beauty"), first, before tejas
and yasas*,41 we may now recall a description of Damayanti*: "celebrated throughout the world for her beauty
[rupam*], majesty [tejas], fame [yasas*], prosperity [sri*], and good fortune" (saubhagyam; 3:50,10).42 The
introduction by beauty is followed by the same first- and second-function qualities as Draupadi's* and then the
indication of still further amplitude in the third.
(10) Finally, in a passage that is not royal on the human level but which nonetheless concerns aisvaryam*,
"lordship" or "sovereignty," on the divine, Uma* tells Siva* he deserves a share in Daksa's* sacrifice because of
his tejas, yasas*, and sri* (12:274,27).
The Virtues of the Functions
It seems beyond dispute that these passages, along with those cited in the previous chapter, demonstrate a
predilection for trifunctional groupings of royal virtues, whether these be in triads, tetrads, or pentads. The
examples have, of course, been selected with their trifunctional design in mind, and no doubt more could be found.
To discuss the composition of these groupings in more detail, however, it will be helpful to have all the variants
before us. The following table presents them in the order they have been discussed in the last two chapters.

It is, of course, to be understood that related classifications of virtues or "power substances" could be found in
other texts. I have stuck, however, primarily to the Mahabharata * and called upon other texts only where they
provide variants on figures who have an epic career: Draupadi-Sri*, the Pandavas*, and Yayati*. We may now
look at these variants more closely, proceeding function by function. One suggestive line of investigation will be to
observe how certain virtues occur primarily in combinations while others occur, within their "function," primarily
alone.
(1) First function. The table shows that tejas appears most often (eight times) without any other virtue as its
counterpart. The parenthetic case (no. 7) where Prahlada's* satya, dharma, and sila* go over to Indra refers to each
of these virtues as a tejas and thus makes them not separate virtues but "forms" or "manifestations" of tejas. Gonda
has protested Dumézil's designation of tejas as a first-function virtue, calling it "an oft-mentioned quality not only
of representatives of the first function, but also of kings and warriors"43but these terms can easily be met in the
context of our present discussion, where we encounter tejas as a first-function royal virtue.44
The other virtues mostly occur in pairs. At first sight there seem to be four main classes of these "coupling" virtues:
(a) those concerning truthfulness (satya, na anrtika*, occurring eleven times, seven in pairs); (b) righteousness
(dharma; seven times, all in pairs); (c) knowledge (vidya*, prajna*, srutam*; five times, three in pairs); and (d)
sacrificial activity and piety (devas*, yajvan, kratu, brahmanyata*, fondness for brahmins, service of gods and
brahmins, sunrta* gir, svadhyayaghosa*; eight times, five in pairs). Only one other virtue appears more than once.
This is vrata, and the two times it does occur, it appears in combinations. Not, however, a virtue that stands
completely

and Destiny of the Warrior, p. 76.
44 Thus the ksatriya* of Gita* 18,43 (see above, before n. 6) possesses tejas, but alongside such other virtues
as sauryam* and danam*.

alone, vrata refers not only to vowkeeping but to the observance of religious obligations, and it is thus most closely
related to the fourth and second of the classes just mentioned, that is, to sacrificial duties and especially to dharma.
In this second case, a parallel has been demonstrated between vratá and dhárman in Rg * Vedic texts, and the term
vratá has been found most closely connected in the Veda with deities of the "first function": with Varuna*
especially, but also with Mitra and, secondarily, with the Adityas* and with kingship.45
With these remarks in mind, let us turn to the only pattern of pairing that occurs with any obvious frequency, that
of satya and dharma (occurring three or four [no. 14] times). Clearly dharma is an elastic and imperialistic term in
the epic, but as denoting righteousness in attitude and behavior, it is thoroughly bound upespecially in the ideology
of kingshipwith piety and the performance of sacrifices. Thus if dharma can be correlated with the sacrificial
virtues, as well as with the ancient meaning of vrata, a pattern begins to emerge. For, just as truthfulness, satya,
occurs with dharma in three or four of its seven pairings, so it occurs two or three times (no. 14 aligns satya with
both dharma and sacrificial dedication) with the sacrificial virtues and once with vrata. Thus in all seven of its
pairings, satya stands opposite a virtue identifiable with dharma.
Meanwhile, if there is a dependable correlation between the sacrificial virtues and dharma in their juxtaposition
with satya, so there is a complementary pattern in the case of the remaining class of virtues, those concerned with
knowledge. For where these are paired with other virtues, they are usuallylike satyaset alongside the sacrificial
virtues. Here the evidence is more limited and uncertain, but in two of the

three instances mentioned, "knowledge" is set beside devas * (no. 6), that is, probably sacrificial divine worship,
and beside vrata (no. 9)the remaining instance being a combination with the irreducible tapas (no. 16).
It thus seems that there is a fundamental dichotomy where the first-function virtues are mentioned in pairs. On one
side satya is the basic term, occasionally giving way to a form of sacred knowledge. Possibly this is to be seen as
an Upanisadic* extension of the fundamental notion of truth: that is, that truth and the "knowledge" of it are one.
And on the other is dharma, recalling and reflected in the virtues of sacrificial action, piety, and vows. It is this
dichotomy, with the several terms indicating it, that is found in the characterizations of Sibi* and Astaka* in the
Yayati* legend (nos. 12 and 14), in the Buddhacarita's description of Yayati* (no. 15), and also in the "act of
truth" by which Krishna revives Pariksit* (nos. 17 and 18 [conclusion]). Here I would point out, first, that although
Dumézil has said that the qualities ascribed to Sibi* and Astaka* are not found elsewhere in Indian divisions within
the first function, there are cases where the two Vedic gods of this functionMitra and Varuna*are defined by them.
For instance, the Rajasuya*, one of the great royal rituals, provides a list of eight "divine instigators" or
"quickeners" (devasu*) of kingship in which the two gods are referred to as Mitra Satya and Varuna*
Dharmapati.46 Thus, although these associations do not seem to point to a consistent set of correlations between
the two gods and these particular virtues,47 one can at least say that the latter are not irreconcilable with the
theology of the "dual sovereigns." Second, if, despite the small

Yudhisthira*.

number of references, one can regard vrata as related primarily to dharma, or "vows" as related to "duty," we have
a fact of capital importance for our forthcoming discussion of the epic's sins.
(2) Second function. On the warrior level there are fewer difficulties. Yasas * appears, like tejas, primarily alone
(six times out of eight). Pairings of the second-function virtues, unlike those of the first function, are infrequent.
But in most of the cases where they do occur, they juxtapose balam (raw "strength") with some more chivalric or
domesticated virtue like viryam* ("heroism, energy") or vrttam* ("activity, occupation"). Although the evidence
here is limited (two cases, one concerning the Pandavas* [no. 10; cf. no. 7]), one is still inclined to suppose that
these bipartitions are modeled after the same second-function division that distinguishes the Herakles-Vayu-
Bhima* type from the Achilles-Indra-Arjuna type48 Otherwise, the second function has been prone to
characterization by single virtues which fall into several clusters. Thus, after yasas*, virtues of strength (indriyam
[?], balam, vikrama) occur nine times, seven singly; of heroism (sura-sauryam*, vira-viryam*) six times, three
singly plus "no turning back in battle"; of conquest or victory two times, both singly; virtues involving honorable
relations with other ksatriyas* (no virodha with Arjuna) occur one or two (? "slew foes righteously") times; virtues
connected with the duty to act (vrttam*, utthanam*) occur twice; and the virtue of not harming (na himsrah*)
occurs once. Perhaps no one second-function virtue was able to keep pace with the changing ideologies of kingship
and warfare. Nonetheless, several of these types of virtues will, like vrata, bear further watching in our discussion
of the epic sins.
(3) Third function. On this level, by far the most frequent entry is sri*, occurring thirteen times, seven singly. In
fact, one is struck by the frequency of sri's* associations with tejas and yasas* (nos. 4,19,27,28; see also Chapter 7,
n. 49). Perhaps

this is a fundamental triad or a set any one or all of which may define its function in royal terms.49 Next to sri * is
danam* and its etymological affiliates (nos. 9 and 26), occurring eight times, four singly. Then come virtues
having to do with beauty or "form" (rupam*, darsaniya*), occurring five times, three of these in pairs or sets. One
striking fact is that sri* rarely occurs with virtues of either of these other types, perhaps because sri*, in its two
meanings, can well account for both: as "prosperity" partially covering danam* and as "beauty" fully covering
rupam* (here no. 27 provides the one exception, in the description of the overample endowments of Damayanti*).
In terms of mythology, we are thus brought back to a point made in the last chapter. The goddess of Sovereignty
and Prosperity, Sri* herself, "rounds out" and completes the royal virtues on the level of the third function, being
represented in the virtue which she herself incarnates.
Nonetheless, while this mythology relates to much in the area of the third function, there are other virtues that seem
to reflect this function's open-endedness toward what Dumézil calls "le nombre,"50 toward multiplicity. Thus there
are the early Brahmanic* references to material goods such as food (annadyam*) and cattle (pasu*), to
nourishment (pusti*), and to the populace of a kingdom (rastram*); and in addition there are references to good
fortune (bhaga, saubhagyam), to creative or generative power (prajati*), and to continuity or purity of race,
family, or lineage (kulam, arya*)all of which, in this latter case, converge when it comes to kingship. The list, in
other words, is heterogeneous. It does not seem to reflect any third-function mythology other than that of Sri*.
There is, however, one other possibility connected with the virtues stressing
49 On sri* as a "symbol and insignia of royalty," see M-W, s.v. See Coomaraswamy, Yaksas*, II, 28, on
tejas and yasas* as similar to the Iranian xvarenh, "royal glory" (also connected with the three functions;
see Dumézil, ME, II, 282-89).

continuity and purity of race and lineage. As Wikander has noted, Sahadeva, the youngest Pandava *, is a sort of
"stay-at-home" (casanier), ever close to Yudhistthira*, and the true representative among his brothers of the Aryan
domestic family and its purity, being twice the carrier and handler of Fire (Agni) for his brothers.51
These convergences of legend and formula may now lead us to some reflections. In the discussion of the Yayati*
legend, when Yayati* offers his daughter Madhavi* to Galava* to help him obtain the eight hundred peculiar
horses, he refers to her as "a promptress of every virtue" (sarvadharmopacayini*; 5:113,11). This epithet, which
defines Madhavi* at the very beginning of her story, is complemented by a similar description at the end. When
she appears from the forest to offer half of her own merits to Yayati*, and thus to seal the bargain between her
father and her sons, she says: "I am your daughter Madhavi*, O king, faring as a deer [mrgacarini*]; by me too is
virtue prompted [mayapyupacito* dharmas]; accept then half of mine" (5:119,24).
I have used the word "prompt" here for upa-ci-, retaining it from the Ganguli-Roy translation of the passage
introducing Madhavi*.52 For upacayin*, Monier-Williams gives the meanings "causing to increase" or "succeed";
and for upa-ci-, the meanings "gather together," "heap together," "increase," and "strengthen." The whole range of
meanings is suggestive for Madhavi's* role with respect to the "virtues." The Critical Edition shows that if the verb
and its derivatives, used consistently for Madhavi*, are representative of the text at its oldest, an inordinate number
of emendations are made in the introductory description (on the contrary, no variants are
51 See Wikander, "Nakula et Sahadeva," p. 87 on Sahadeva as "casanier," and pp. 73 and 89 on Sahadeva
and Fire; on the latter, see 3:143,14 (protecting the Pandavas'* Agnihotra) and 2:61,6.

cited for the second usage). Thus, for -upacayini * ("a promptress"; 5:113,11), other manuscripts introduce -
upacarini* ("one who attends upon"), -padini* (? "one footed in"), -pravadini* ("one who declares"), and several
commentators cite -apacayini* ("gatherer"). For -dharmopacayini* ("promptress of virtues"), one text introduces
the bland -dharmarthadayini* ("producer of dharma and artha"). And finally, several manuscripts insert a whole
extra line (455*) including the added description, or "correction," making Madhavi* sarvadharmapradayini* ("a
bestower of every virtue") or sarvadharmapravadini* ("a declarer of every virtue"). From so many variants, it
would seem that the original term has been obscured or forgotten, with varying degrees of misrepresentation.
Madhavi* certainly does not "gather" or "declare" the virtues (she says very little), nor does she produce dharma
and artha. We thus seem to have here an old way of referring to a peculiar rapport with the royal virtues that
would seem especially suited for a royal heroine. At least in the case of Madhavi*, it is clearly her sex, and
moreover her repeated virginity, that makes it possible for her to be "one who causes four lineages to stand, ... a
promptress of every virtue."
In the main story of the Mahabharata*, just one heroine, Draupadi*, shares a number of the characteristics of
Madhavi*: an identification with Sri*, multiple husbands, and a return to virginity after each childbirth. But in
each of these areas, the differences are as great and as obvious as the similarities.53 They identify the two heroines
only as broadly similar figures and indicate no common legend or mythological prototype. But within the
similarities lies one general point at which their legends converge. Both are rescuers of royal lineages. Madhavi*
saves four royal lines when she "prompts" the virtues that appear in her sons, and again, she rescues her father's
heritage of royal virtues when she "prompts" the restoration that sends
53 See ME, II, 363: unlike Draupadi*, Madhavi* remains perpetually a virgin, wedded not to humans but to
the Forest.

him back to heaven. Draupadi *, on the other hand, rescues the Pandavas*, and thus the "true" descent of the Kuru
line, when they have lost everything at the game of dice in the Sabhaparvan*.54 This very scene, the dice game,
provides the frame of reference for a message concerning Draupadi* which Kunti* sends, through Krishna, to the
twins. Urging these two more gentle of the Pandavas* to avenge the humiliation of Draupadi* in the sabha* by the
use of force and the practice of ksatradharma*, Kunti* says: "While you were looking on, Panicali*, a promptress
of every virtue [sarvadharmopacayini*] was addressed with harsh words. Who can endure this?" (5:135,15).
Draupadi*, then, shares this epithet with Madhavi* and, to my knowledgeafter considerable checkingwith no one
else. Here, too, there is evidence of misunderstanding or tampering: thus we have -dharmapacayini* ("gathering
every virtue"), -karmopacayini* ("prompting every action"), and in some versions (followed by Ganguli-Roy), the
original term is kept, but applied to the twins (sarvadharmopacayinam*) rather than Draupadi*!55
It thus seems likely that the epithet records an early conception of the virtues connected with a feminine
incarnation of "sovereignty," whether Madhavi-Medb*56 or Sri-Draupadi*. Perhaps the use of dharmas for
"virtues" is earlier than its rival, gunas*, although this does not seem provable. The important point is that the
virtues "prompted" by these heroineswhether dharmas or gunas*are trifunctional and are "prompted" at junctures
that are critical for the continuity of royal lineages and destinies. Indeed, they are most critical for figures who
represent the kingship of the "central" Kuru dynasty, insofar as, in one case, they ultimately concern the salvation
of Yayati* and, in the other, the origin and rescue of the Pandavas*.

Finally, it is quite possible that these "promptings" are the epic counterparts of themes and mechanisms that were at
one point also found in rituals. One cannot, of course, reconstruct rituals from myths and legends. As Dumézil
says, special royal rituals may lie behind the name Medb (with its connotation of "intoxicating drink"), but they are
ones which "it would be as easy as it would be vain to imagine."57 In the case of India, however, we have already
noticed that the Asvamedha * involves a transfer of royal virtues from the horse to the king by three queens, all
"forms of Sri*."58 So it is not a question of trying to reconstruct an ancient royal ritual, but of observing a number
of mythic and epic themes which may, at some point, have held ritual implications.
In several stories, special figures, of sacred or priestly status, facilitate the liaisons between the female
personifications of sovereignty and their royal male partners. In the Yayati* legend, it is the brahmin Galava* who
leads Madhavi* from one royal bed to the next. And in a myth from the Santiparvan*,59 the brahmin-rsi* Narada*
("Water-Giver") is present to perform ablutions with Indra at the purest spot (probably the source) of the Ganges
just before Indra is united with Sri*. In the main narrative of the Mahabharata*in one of its strangest passagesis a
similar episode.
When Krishna is on his "peace" embassy to Hastinapura*, having found Duryodhana intractable, he visits the
latter's greatest ally, Karna*, to sound him out on some last-ditch proposals. Disclosing to Karna* that he is
"legally" (dharmatas) a "Pandava*" (son of Pandu*),60 Krishna urges him to make his identity known and declare
his seniority over his "brothers." The latter, Krishna promises, will then embrace his feet, as
57 Dumézil, ME, II, 340.
58 See above, Chapter 7, at n. 23.
59 See above, Chapter 7, after n. 53.
60 Karna* is a son of either the kanina* ("born of a young woman") or sahodha* ("brought with" a woman at
marriage) type (5:138,8-9), having been born to Kunti* in her youth, before her marriage to Pandu*. Thus, as
said earlier, Karna* is a potential king.

will Abhimanyu, the sons of Draupadi *, and the Pandavas'* allies (5:138, 12-13). But in addition, Krishna makes
a second promise that is psychologically fantastic, defying what we know from several other incidents, especially
the Svayamvara* and the dice game.61 If Karna* reveals his identity, says Krishna, he can prepare to be installed
as king; "and, during the sixth period, Draupadi* will come to you" (sasthe* ca tvam* tatha* kale*
draupadyupagamisyati; 138,15). The Ganguli-Roy translation is surely right in following this with a parenthetic
"as a wife."62 There are but two real differences between this and the other passages cited: first, one has difficulty
imagining Draupadi* complying;63 and second, Karna*, unlike the partners of Madhavi* and the "chosen ones" of
Sri*, is uninterested. The mysterious transferal is only proposed, and the proposal is kept secret.
There are, to be sure, mythological overtones to this passage. Some of these are echoed in a follow-up speech
made to Karna*
61 On Draupadi* and Karna* at the Svayamvara*, see above, Chapter 7, n. 44; in the dice game Karna*
insults her, calling her multiple marriage adharmic (2:61,34-6) and herself a slave (dasi*; 61,81).
62 Ganguli-Roy, trans., Mahabharata, IV: Udyoga Parva, 279; Krishna explicitly promises Karna* union with
Draupadi* in the Andhra Mahabharatam; see Subramanian, Vyasa and Variations, p. 201; but it would have to
be implied even if one takes sasthe* kale* as "meal-time": see M-W, pp. 278 and 110. The commentator
Nilakantha* is silent. See also Georg Buhler and Johann Kirste, "Indian Studies, No. II: Contributions to the
History of the Mahabharata*," SKAWW, Philosophisch-Historische Classe, vol. CXXVII, Abhandlung XI
(1892), 19, discussing an alternate reading from Kumarila's* Tantravarttika*: "It is for this reason [because
Draupadi* is an incarnation of Sri*] that Vasudeva* says to Karna*: 'And on the sixth day [ahani] Draupadi*
will serve thee.' For how else could a person, whose word is authoritive, speak thus?" Although Bühler and
Kirste view the variant as the original, it is surely a substitution that reveals some considerable postepic
embarrassment at Krishna's behavior.
63 Krishna's suggestion is of a different order from extratextual stories which speak of a secret attachment of
Draupadi* for Karna*even making the one sin which stops her from reaching heaven (which the traditional text
says was a "partiality for Arjuna"; 17:2,6)that she harbored a desire for Karna*. I have several times heard
such stories, in both Maharashtra and Tamilnadu.

by Kunti *, his mother: "Acquired formerly by Arjuna [arjunenarjitam*], greedily seized by the wickedsnatching it
away from the sons of Dhrtarastra*, enjoy that prosperity belonging to Yudhisthira*" (bhuhksva* yaudhisthiram*
sriyam*; 5:143,8). This sri* which Kunti* speaks of must certainly refer, even if not solely, to Draupadi*.
Moreover, when Draupadi* was "acquired by Arjuna" as a bride, it was Kunti's* fateful words that united her with
her four other sons as well. In fact, the present words to Karna* seem unmistakably reminiscent of the earlier
words concerning Draupadi*. Thinking her sons had returned home with edible alms (bhiksa*; 1:182,1), she told
them: "May you all enjoy [it (her)] together" (bhunkteti* sametya sarve; 182,2).64 In each passage, the use of the
root bhuj, "eat, enjoy," carries a sexual overtone.65 Do we not honor the poets most if we assume that these
coincidencesall concerning words of Kunti* to her sons about Draupadi*are "real" and intended?
As suggested in earlier chapters, the relationship of Draupadi*, Sri* incarnate, to Visnu's* avatara*, Krishna, is
full of ambiguities: identical names, a coded language, and, at times, the sense that while she is "in essence" and
"in intention" united with him, she is forever provisionally preoccupied with others. Taking this intimate but
noncommittal relationship into account, one cannot escape the impression that Krishnawhom we have seen
elsewhere in archaic priestly roles66is, at least in the present scene, Draupadi's* Galava*. He is implicitly
empowered (and we may assume that he anticipates Karna's* negative response) to facilitate, as a go-between or
64 Some Southern texts give bhunksvadhvamiti* pramadat*.

66 Cf. also the matchmaker role of the famous brahmin Vasistha*, purohita to the Pandavas'* ancestors at the
time of King Samvarana*, who went to the Sun to obtain permission for the king to marry the Sun's daughter
Tapati* (1:162,12-163,9; and see above, Chapter 7, n. 60); similarly, Drupada's purohita (presumably the same
as will later precede Krishna as prewar envoy for the Pandavas*; see above, Chapter 6, n. 63) serves as
messenger and go-between in arranging Draupadi's* marriage with the Pandavas* (1:185,14-15).

royal matchmaker, what amounts to a transfer of sovereignty. Moreover, there is a passage which confirms a role
for Krishna in maintaining the standards and the mechanisms of kingship. In the first meeting between Krishna and
the Pandavas * at the beginning of the forest exile, Draupadi* herself, in the mythologically allusive exchange that
she and Krishna have, says to him:
Of Rajarsis* who are of meritorious acts, unretreating in battle, and endowed with every virtue, you are the
refuge [or way], O best of men.
rajarsinam* punyakrtamahavesvanivartinam*
sarvadharmopapannanam* tvam* gatih* purusvttama* [3:13,49]
Krishna is thus the "refuge" of every "omnivirtuous" monarch, or claimant to the sovereignty which Draupadi*, as
Sri* incarnate, represents "on earth."

Chapter 9
Sins of the Sovereign
The last two chapters have provided a framework within which to interpret the virtues that enhance the royal figure
of Yudhisthira *. Despite much variation and considerable inflation, a consistent trifunctional theme has been
detected. Now for the countertheme. Underlying the discussion will be two assumptions, familiar from the
opening* chapter. First, it is the nature of epic (treating as it does of human "psychology" and "destiny") to open
vistas on the nature of sin and virtue; second, the twovirtue and sinmust be studied and interpreted through their
relation to each other.
Probably no facet of the Mahabharata* has elicited more varied comment than the Pandavas'* and Krishna's
involvement in numerous sins.1 I will not attempt to discuss every incident, but I will try to place some of them in
a new perspective by examining their "motive": the goal of sovereignty. The brief begins with the "legal
precedents" set by certain famous moments in the career of the divine sovereign, Indra.
The Sins of Indra
The theme before us is one which Dumézil has explored from different angles: "the three sins of the warrior," that
is, a series of sins against the three functions. Dumézil's discussion of this

mythologem has undergone several refinements. His original comparisons concerned the "cadre," or "frame," of
three "sins" and three "losses," culminating in an annihilation of the sinner, which he discovered in the legends of
the Scandinavian Starkadr-Starcatherus, the Greek Heracles, and in the mythology of Indra.2 More recently,
however, he retains only the first two figures and adds two more heroes: the Mahabharata's * Sisupa1a*, and,
possibly in protracted form, the Roman warrior king Tullus Hostilius.3 The total picture has thus been greatly
sharpened, in particular by the discussion of Sisupala*. But Indra has perhaps been dropped too quickly. According
to Dumézil, "It now seems probable that it [the Indra myth] is a question of a secondary application, of an artificial
extension into mythology, of the epic theme."4 Dumézil thus bases his view on a distinction drawn between myth
and epic, with the theme of the three sins having originally pertained to the latter: "Indra's sins are matters of
mythology, those of Starkadr and of Heracles [and of Sisupa1a*] are matters of epic."5
It does not seem likely that any evidence will emerge to dispute the historical side of these judgments. No Indo-
European figure of myth, no warrior god, other than Indra, has been found to commit a trifunctional assortment of
significantly interrelated sins. Thus, as a mythical theme, Indra's three sins may well be an Indian invention. But
this does not mean that one must follow Dumézil in regarding Indra's three sins as an "artificial extension" of the
epic theme. There is no way to account for Indra borrowing, or copying, the sins of Sisupa1a*, or, for that matter,
of assuming the sins from an earlier form of the legend. Nonetheless, the one myth which

attributes to Indra three successive sins against the three functions does seem to be an "artificial extension" of
something. This is the myth of Markandeya * Purana* 5, discussed in Chapter 7,6 in which Indra's three sins result
in the losses of his tejas, balam, viryam*, and rupam*, and ultimately in the births of the Pandavas*. It was argued
in Chapter 7 that this myth represents an "artificial" attempt to clear Draupadi* of the polyandry charge. But here,
in speaking of an "artificial extension," I have in mind not a continuation of a heroic tradition like the Sisupala*
legend, but an artificial treatment, in the sense of synthetic and eclectic, of earlier traditions about the sins and
punishments of Indra.
On this subject, I am much in debt to Dumézil. He has shown that while "Indra has no criminal record in the Rg*
Veda,"7 the Brahmanas* provide extensive lists of Indra's misdeeds, usually mentioning one or more of those
which come to be included in more complete renditions. Aitareya Brahmana* 7,28, for instance, has Indra commit
his first two sins against the same two figuresVisvarupa* and Vrtra*as Markandeya* 5; and Satapatha*
Brahmana* 1,6,3,-17 provides a detailed narrative of this same sequence. According to the latter passage, also
discussed in Chapter 7,8 Indra first slew the three-headed Visvarupa*, son of Tvastr*. Furious, Tvastr* created
Vrtra*, and as the latter developed, he "came to be possessed of Agni and Soma, of all sciences [vidyas*], all glory
[yasas*], all nourishment [annadyam*], all prosperity" (sri*; 8). In order for Indra again to become "what Indra
now is," it was necessary that all the divinities (devas*) and each of the above qualities return to him (15), after
which Indra slew Vrtra* (16-17). As

suggested earlier, these losses and recoveries probably have a tripartite structure, like those in Markandeya * 5. But
they are all connected in this passage with just one incident, the slaying of Vrtra*, which the passage does not
actually speak of as a sin.
Not until the Markandeya* 5 account is all this systematized to include not only the trifunctional losses and
recoveries, but the concurrence of each loss with a sin against the corresponding function. Moreover, this myth
provides the first mention of Indra's violation of the brahmani* Ahalya* (a story long known) in a list of Indra's
sins, and thus the first ascription of this episode to the zone of the third function.9 To recapitulate briefly, first
Indra slays the brahmin Visvarupa*, losing his tejas; second, breaking a warrior's agreement to "friendship"
(sakhyam), he slays Vrtra* and loses his balam; and third, violating Ahalya*, he loses his rupam*.10
As I argued that this myth offers an "artificial" reinterpretation of Draupadi's* polyandry, I must now suggest that it
has rearranged certain traditional, albeit entirely Indian, material concerning Indra's sins. Once again, there is a
more coherent myth within the Mahabharata* itself, one dealing not with three sins and the births of the
Pandavas*, but, as probably already reflected in Satapatha* Brahmana* 1,6,3, two sins, a series of losses, and a
final restoration of Indra to sovereignty.11 In the epic, the version of this myth that is contextually most important
occurs in the Udyogaparvan (5:9-18), with another complete version told in the Santiparvan* (12:329,17-41) and
numerous spinoffs elsewhere.12 As will be suggested mainly through footnotes, there are reasons to regard the
Udyogaparvan

version as the more ancient treatment of the sequence, which concerns three great threats to Indra's throne.
(1) "From hatred of Indra" (indradrohat *), Tvastr*, by his great tapas, created a son having three heads:
Visvarupa*, who "longed for Indra's seat" (endram* sa prarthayatsthanam*; 5:9,3-4).13 Visvarupa* was a
brahmin, who read the Vedas with one of his three mouths and was "intent upon a life of religious practices and
austerities"; he was also a threat to Indra because of his "unlimited tejas" (9,7). In order to deprive Visvarupa* of
this "energy," Indra ordered the Apsarases to try to tempt him; but he would not be distracted. Indra then "decided
on a weapon"his vajra (9,20)to destroy Visvarupa*.14 However, after killing him the chief of the celestials found
no peace (sarman*) and felt himself scorched by Visvarupa's* tejas (dipitastasya* tejasa*; 9,24). Though Indra
soon returned to heaven as king, his sin of killing a brahminone who threatened him especially by his tejaswas yet
to be atoned for.
(2) Enraged that Indra had slain his son "who had committed no offense at all," Tvastr*, again by tapas, created
Vrtra* to kill Indra. In their first fight, Indra was swallowed by Vrtra*. But Vrtra* was made to yawn, and Indra
escaped, only to retreat from his foe, who was "endowed with strength" (balasamanvita; 9,50). In distress, the
gods, led by Indra, repaired to Visnu*, who told them: "I shall tell you a contrivance [upayam* vaksyami*]
whereby he shall be annihilated. ... Adopt toward him a conciliatory policy ... ; remaining
13 This theme of rivalry for the sovereignty is not found in 12:329, where Indra's opposition turns on
Visvarupa's* change from purohita of the gods to that of the Asuras (18-23).
14 In 12:329, Indra obtains advice from Brahma* (24-25) and help from Visnu*, who pervades the vajra by
which Indra kills Visvarupa* (27). This version ascribes the origin of the vajra to Dadhica's* bones (25) and is
thus oriented to show, as it concludes, that Indra was able to overcome a brahmin foe only by having access to
another brahmin's (Dadhica's*) "energy" (brahmatejas; 41).

invisible, I shall enter Indra's thunderbolt" (5:10, 10-13).
The rsis * then went to Vrtra* and said: "Let there be eternal friendship [sakhyam* bhavatu ... nityada*] between
you and Indra" (10,19). Then they delivered a sermon on sakhyam and declared what a faithful "friend" Indra
would be (10,23-26). Vrtra* agreed on the condition that "Indra himself or the gods do not kill me by what is dry,
or wet; by a stone, or by wood; by a weapon [sastrena*] or by a missile [vajrena*]; in the daytime, or at night"
(10,29). Thus an accord was reached, but Indra passed his time searching for a "loophole" (randhram; 10,32).
Then, one evening (neither night nor day), seeing Vrtra* by the seashore (neither land nor sea?), Indra saw his
opportunity, and, "bearing Visnu* in mind, he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth [phena] as large as a
hill. And he said, 'this is neither wet, nor dry....' And he threw the mass of froth, blended with his thunderbolt, at
Vrtra*. And Visnu*, having entered within the froth, put an end to Vrtra's* life" (10,35-39).
Soon, however, after much rejoicing, Indra became "overpowered by falsehood" (anrtenabhibhuta*; 10,42), that is,
by the sin of not keeping his agreement with Vrtra*; and he was also "overpowered by the brahminicide"
(abhibhutasca* ... brahmahatyaya*; 10,42) of killing Visvarupa*.15 Departing from his throne, "bereft of his
senses and consciousness and overpowered by his own sins" (abhibhutah* svakalmasaih*; 10,43), he could not be
recognized. "And he lay concealed in the water, just like a writhing snake" (43).16
(3) Without a king for the divine throne, the gods sought out the "handsome" (sriman*; 5:11,1) Nahusa*, a human
being and, by dynastic reckonings, the father of Yayati*. Addressing him, "O lord of earth, be our king" (raja* no
bhava parthiva*), the gods convinced him to "protect the kingdom in heaven"
15 This differentiation between the two sins is not made in 12:329; there it is the sin of brahminicide
doubled (tasyam* dvaidhibhutayam* brahmavadhyayam*; 28) that causes Indra, out of fear, to enter the
lotus stalk.
16 Cf. JB 2,234: when Agni succeeds in purifying Indra of his sins by sacrifice, Indra, "as a serpent would get
rid of its skin, ... got rid of all his evil."

(pahi * rajyam* trivistape*; 11,2-4). But having assumed power, Nahusa*, till then "always of virtuous soul, fell
into a sensuous turn of mind" (dharmatma* satatam bhutva* kamatma* samapadyata; 11,8). He surrounded
himself with Apsarases and numerous enjoyments (9-12). But his voluptuous existence soon brought him to
commit a most critical error, in fact, a sin: he coveted Saci*,17 Indra's wife.
In fear and distress, Saci* sought protection from Brhaspati*, the gods' chaplain, who promised to reunite her with
Indra. Nahusa* was outraged at Saci's* refusal, and the gods and rsis* attempted to pacify him, urging him to "turn
back his inclination from the sin of outraging another's wife" (12,4). Then, most intriguingly in this context,
Nahusa* reminded them that "Ahalya* of spotless fame, the wife of a rsi*, was outraged by Indra while her
husband was still alive" (12,6). Nahusa* thus convinced the gods and rsis* to bring Saci* to him, but Brhaspati*
refused to abandon one who had come to him for refuge (12,26). After some deliberation, it was agreed that Saci*
should go and beseech Nahusa* for a delay, which Nahusa* granted, in which to make up her mind and to learn
what had become of Indra (13,4-5). Returning to Brhaspati*, she then went with all the gods to seek the advice of
Visnu*, who said that Indra would be absolved of his sins and would regain his kingdom when he performed a
horse sacrifice (13,13). The gods then found Indra (it is not told how18) and performed a horse sacrifice
(asvamedha*; 13,26) for him. Visnu* then "distributed [vibhajya] the sin of brahminicide [the foremost sin] among
trees, rivers, mountains, earth, and women" (13,27), and Indra became "free of sin" (putapapma*; 13,28).19
17 12:329 condenses the enjoyment theme to the essentials: sarvam* mam* sakropabhuktam*
upasthitamrte* sacim*; "everything enjoyed by Indra is obtained by me except Saci*" (31).
18 Cf. the smoother, and thus probably later, 12:329,40: they learn Indra's whereabouts from Saci*, who gets
Indra to come forth from the lotus stalk.
19 See Hopkins, Epic Mythology, pp. 130-31. 12:329,41 has no parallel role for Visnu*.

The account continues at some length, but Nahusa's * fall is finally occasioned by a device: Indra tells Saci* to
inform Nahusa* that she will yield to him if he will have his vehicle borne by the celestial rsis* (15,9-13). While
being carried one day, Nahusa* uttered an untruth and touched one of his bearers, Agastya, on the head with his
foot. "At this ... he became divested of power and good looks" (nihsrikas*; 17, 12).
The connection between this continuous mythical narrative and the Markandeya* Purana's* division of the three
sins of Indra among the three functions should be apparent. Whereas in the Markandeya* account Indra loses his
tejas after conquering Visvarupa*, and his balam after conquering Vrtra*, in this epic narrative his opponents are
characterized by just these attributes. Visvarupa* has "unlimited tejas" (amitatejas), and Vrtra* is "endowed with
strength" (balasamanvita), as well as with honor in the contract that Indra breaks. But the myth of the three sins
finds no such parallels in the third episode. Instead, there are inversions. First, rather than being committed by
Indra, a sin, or an affront, is committed against him, or more exactly against his wife. And this sin, or at least its
intent, is the stated equivalent of the third-function sin committed by Indra, and in the present context even
attributed to him: the violation of Ahalya*. In fact, just as in the Markandeya* account of Indra's third sin, Indra is
marked by the loss of his beauty (rupam*), so Nahusa* falls "without his beauty" (nihsrikas*) in consequence of
his attempt to seduce Saci*. Furthermore, in both of the third-function episodesand in contrast to the first two
episodes which concern only gods and Asurasthe sin concerns a sexual transgression between gods and humans,
but again inverted: in one case, Indra violates the brahmani* Ahalya*; in the other, Nahusa*, a man, covets the
divine Saci*. Nahusa's* status as a human king will be discussed later. His voluptuous, sensuous turn makes his
reign representative of the third function: here not as a level against which Indra sins, but as a level no longer
accessible to Indra. The epic gives us, then, an account of two

sins of Indra, with a third sin committed against rather than by him, ultimately allowing him to regain his throne.
Yudhisthira * the Sinner
In the epic narrative the first person (aside from Krishna who is involved in nearly every misdeed) who might be
expected to continue the sins of Indra would be Indra's son Arjuna. But Arjuna is not helpful when it comes to
committing sins. As Dumezil* puts it, Arjuna, "the son or partial incarnation of Indra, ... has all this god's qualities
and in addition a certain refinement, and sometimes a self-control, which are sadly lacking in his model."20
Arjuna may have a guilty hand in the deaths of Bhagadatta, his father's "friend" (7:28, 18; 29,1; 168,27), of
Bhurisravas*, Jayadratha, Bhisma*, Karna*, and Duryodhana; or he may be charged with one sintoo much pride in
his heroism (17:2,21)which makes him temporarily experience Hell at the end of the epic. But next to every other
hero (except perhaps the twins), Arjuna stands as the very model of decency and purity, surely the most frequent
recipient of the epithet "sinless one" (anagha) and of such titles as "he of unstained" or "of pure deeds"
(aklistakarman*; 3:39, 1; visuddhakarman*; 3:161,29). Nor is it just a matter of epithets and titles, for several
episodes portray Arjuna in this shining light.21
One might propose several explanations for this discontinuity between myth and epic. Surely one factor is that
Arjuna's mystical identity with Krishna, his status as the "warrior yogi" who learns in the Gita*before the battlethat
he must fight with detachment, makes actual sins inconceivable. As Walter Ruben has perceived, the Gita's* ethic
of desireless action, or of action for another's sake, justifies the "sins," and this would

apply not only to Krishna but to Arjuna.22 But the most important factor is that Indra's sins are committed not as
"warrior sins" but as "sins of a sovereign." This means that the Indian myths do not allow one to apply an
otherwise most useful distinction set up by Dumezil * between the single "sin of the sovereign" (usually a form of
lying or pride, as with Yayati*) and the "three sins of the warrior."23 In the myths concerning Indra, the two
categories merge. Though Indra's sins are close to, and in the Markandeya* account even identical with, the warrior
pattern, he is never totally destroyed by them like Sisupala* and the latter's European legendary counterparts.24
Rather, Indra commits his sins as a sovereign, with sovereignty as the end ever held in sight. This motive does not
apply to Arjuna or for that matter to any of the triple sinners of legend who are in general servants of, and
spokesmen for, sovereigns rather than sovereigns themselves.
The setting of Indra's sins is thus the perennial contention between the Devas and the Asuras, one aspect of which
was noticed earlier. In the epic transposition of the theme of the "three steps," the one feature that ties in Krishna's
maneuvers with the Vamana* myththe more recent, post-Vedic, rendition of the three steps themeis that Krishna
helps the Pandavas* regain what was formerly theirs.25 The conflict between the Devas and Asuras over universal
sovereignty is marked by a recurring pattern of reversals and triumphs. The same, on the epic level, is true of the
conflict between the Kauravas and the Pandavas*. The figure analogous to Indra, the "sovereign sinner" whose sins
are part of such a seesaw

drama, is not Arjuna but another of the "five Indras among men": Yudhisthira *.
Let us concern ourselves with the questions of Yudhisthira's* complicity and "motivation" and reserve discussion
of his particular sins for the next chapter. Nowhere are these matters more in evidence than in a scene after the
battle, where Yudhisthira*, in a sort of mea culpa, renounces all desire to rule and expresses the wish to perform
acts of penance.
First he recalls the fall of Bhisma* (12:27,4-13): "He on whose limbs I used to roll about in sport, that son of
Ganga* has been caused by me, covetous of sovereignty [or kingship;26 maya* rajyalubdhena*], to fall" (4). The
responsibility is not lessened or contradicted by further reference to the parts played in slaying Bhisma* by Arjuna
and Sikhandin*, for over and over Yudhisthira* claims the fault as his own, his words culminating in the lament:
"He by whom we were reared as youths, by whom we were protected, has been caused to be slain by me, covetous
of sovereignty, sinful, a slayer of gurus, stupefied, all for the sake of short-lived sovereignty" (sa maya*
rajyalubdhena* papena*> gurughatina/alpakalasya* rajyasya* krte* mudhena* ghatitah*; 13).
Next he recalls the death of Drona* (12:27,14-17): "And the acarya*, the great bowman revered by all kingshaving
approached [me] in battle, he was addressed falsely by [my] sinful [self] concerning his son" (mithya*
papenoktah* sutam* prati; 14). He recounts briefly the details of his own lie, laments that he hypocritically
"resorted to the garb of truth" (satyakan-cukamasthaya*; 17), and asks: "What lokas shall I now obtain having
performed such a cruel act" (karma darunam*; 16-17)? This lie, indeed, is consistently represented as
Yudhisthira's most explicit sin, the one which, at the end of the epic, makes
26 I will use the word "sovereignty" to cover Yudhisthira's* aspirations, whether it translates rajyam* or
aisvaryam*. Both are used interchangeably in this regard.

him see Hell with his brothers (18:3,14). It will be discussed further.
Then, in just one sloka *, he recalls the death of Karna*, fully admitting his personal guilt: "And having caused
Karna*, unretreating in battle, my eldest brother, exceedingly fierce, to be slain, who is there that is more a sinner
[papakrttamah*] than I" (18)?
And finally, Yudhisthira laments the deaths of the Pandavas*' children. First he takes the blame for the death of
Arjuna's son Abhimanyu, accepting the sin of "lineage destruction" (jnatighatin*; 12:27,3) through the symbolism
of a violation of youth, sexuality, and fertility: "And Abhimanyu who was like a lion born in the fields, a
youthcovetous [lubdha], I caused him to penetrate that array protected by Drona*. Since then I have not been able
to look Arjuna ... or Krishna in the face, [being] like one who commits the offense of slaying an embryo"
(kilbisi*i> brunaha* yatha*; 27,19-20). In this same connection, mentioning no special fault of his own, he also
laments the deaths of the five sons of Draupadi*, comparing her loss to that of the earth (prthivi*) deprived of her
five mountains (21), a simile seemingly reflected in his words of summary: "This am I, a doer of evil
[agaskarah*], sinful [papah*], a destroyer of the earth" (prthivinasakarakah*; 27, 22).
This confession presents much intriguing symbolism that I will discuss later, but there is one more scenefrom
before rather than after the battlewhich sheds considerable light on Yudhisthira's* involvements. It falls into place
directly after that other "preparation" (udyoga) for battle in which, after Arjuna and Duryodhana have both come to
Krishna's bedside, it is determined that the latter will side with the Pandavas*.27 In one scene we see how Arjuna
and Krishna will work together; in the next we see how Yudhisthira* works alone.

Hearing that war is likely, Salya *the king of Madra and brother of Madri*, Nakula and Sahadeva's mother28sets
out with his troops to join forces with the Pandavas*. But when Duryodhana learns of this, he has groups of festive
halls or pavilions (sabhas*) built to welcome him. We thus see Salya* in a circumstance identical with one in
which we earlier saw Krishna, for each has his progress to Hastinapura* halted by such sabhas* which
Duryodhana and, in Krishna's case, Dhrtarastra* have constructed to put them under obligation to the Kurus.29 We
will see contrasts and juxtapositions elsewhere between Krishna and Salya*, but in these present scenes, Krishna is
beyond temptation, "not even looking" at the sabhas*, while Salya's* response reveals a most significant flaw in
his character: "There [at the most splendid sabha*], preoccupied with sense-enjoyments [visayairyuktah*] that
were beautiful and fit for beings superior to men [atimanusaih*], he thought himself to be extraordinary and
despised Indra [avamene puramdaram*]. And that bull among ksatriyas*, thrilled [prahrstah*], then asked the
servants: 'Which of Yudhisthira's* men built these sabhas*? ... They deserve to be rewarded'" (5:8,9-10). At this
point out of the wings comes Duryodhana and claims the reward for himself: that Salya* be "the leader of my
entire army."30 Salya* is bound by his own sensually motivated generosity. But upon agreeing to Duryodhana's
terms, he still insists on visiting the Pandavas*, and when he arrives and tells of his new employ, Yudhisthira*
wastes no time in responding:
28 Probably one key to the proximity of these episodes is that both Krishna and Salya* are related to the
Pandavas* through the latter's mothers, the two maternal alliances* being thus dealt with consecutively.
29 For the scene involving Krishna, see above, Chapter 6, following n. 49.
30Sarvasenapraneta*; this is curious, for Salya* is the last marshal, not the first; one might align this with
Ruben's notion that the fight with Salya* was perhaps the original single battle of the great war (see Krishna, p.
231); but Duryohana probably just anticipates that Salya* will eventually be his senapati*.

It is well done .... Fortunately, there is only one thing that I wish done by you, O lord of the earth. Here you
are the equal of Vasudeva * in battle. When the duel between Karna* and Arjuna occurs, there is no doubt
that Karna's* driving will be done by you. On that occasion, if you wish me well, Arjuna is to be protected
by you and the destruction of Karna's* energy [tejovadhas] is to be achieved, producing our victory. Even
though this surely ought not to be done, you should do it [akartavyamapi hyetatkartumarhasi],31 O uncle.
[5:8,25- 27]
Salya's* alleged parity with Krishna draws no comment. The former simply agrees, point by point, without
hesitation, to do Yudhisthira's* bidding. But then his words take a surprising turn. Referring sympathetically to the
hardships suffered by the Pandavas*, he predicts that they will "have their end in happiness" (8,35). Then, referring
to the "great suffering" (mahadduhkham*) once experienced by Indra and his wife, he makes the point that even
the gods must sometimes endure misery (36-37). When Yudhisthira* asks how Indra and his wife suffered, Salya*
launches into the "history" of Indra's sins that was met in the first part of this chapter: the trilogy of Indra's sin-
ridden conflicts with Visvarupa*, Vrtra*, and Nahusa*.
The question now is whether there is a significant connection between the myth and its place in the epic. Certainly
Salya's* initial reasons for reciting it are unrevealing and would be more suitable if the Pandavas* were still
"miserable" in the forest. The Indra cycle, as we have seen, is more than just a tale of "woes"; it is, in its various
forms, a tale of increasing defamation through flawed triumphs leading to a temporary loss of heaven's throne and
a final restoration. Fortunately, when Salya* has concluded his narrative, he gives another, much more satisfactory
reason for its telling:
31 Some Northern manuscripts insert this concluding admission of immoral intent a second time, just
before the actual request; see Udyogaparvan 62*, after 5:8,25.

Even so, you will obtain sovereignty [rajyam *] as did Sakra*, having slain Vrtra .... The ill-behaved
Nahusa*, that brahmin hater, was overthrown by Agastya's curse and ruined for endless years. So too your
wicked-souled foesKarna* and Duryodhana to begin with will quickly meet with destruction. Then will you
enjoy the earth [medinim*; "she having fatness or fertility"], bounded by the ocean, together with your
brothers and Draupadi* .... This story of Indra's victory, of status equal to the Veda, should be heard by a
king desirous of victory when his armies have been arrayed. Thus do I have you hear of victory, O best of
victors. [upakhyanamidam* sakravijayam* vedasammitam* / rajna* vyudhesvanikesu* srotavyam*
jayamicchata* / / tasmatsamsravayami* tvam* vijayam* jayatam* vara; 5:18, 12-17]
It is most important to stress that, as the "preparations" for the battle begin, it is just after the Dharmaraja* has
proposed his first "improper" (akartavya) act that he hears a recital of the full story of Indra's tainted victories. This
can hardly be fortuitous: the poets have seen the rapports between the myth and the epic and have juxtaposed the
two of them. Let us also note that it is Salya* who forecasts Yudhisthira's* enjoyment of the earth. Indeed, one is
pointed toward a matter of considerable irony. Salya*, the narrator of Indra's conquests, is one of the chief figures
Yudhisthira* will have to overcome.

Chapter 10
The Deaths of the Four Marshals
The Mahabharata * war is the scene of numerous questionable acts which the text does not hesitate to call sins.1
Nearly all are committed by heroes on the Pandava* side, and the guiding hand seems almost always to be that of
Krishna.2 There is, however, in one set of incidents, a definite and consistent series of involvements by two
figures: Krishna and Yudhisthira*. This is the series that provides the very scansion of the epic war: the deaths of
the four senapatis*, "armylords" or "marshals," of the Kaurava side, the deaths of the four figures who give their
names to the four battle parvans. Let us now take them up one at a time.
Death of Bhisma*
Deep in the night after the ninth day on which Bhisma* has played havoc with the Pandava* troops, the latter take
counsel
1 Against this usage (rather unconvincingly), see Ruben, Krishna, pp. 257-58, and above, Chapter 9, n. 22.
2 Outside of the four episodes discussed below, which have their own interior coherence, the main cluster
occurs in the Dronaparvan* and includes Krishna's most audacious and miraculous tricks: stepping in front of
Bhagadatta's Vaisnava* weapon to turn it into a garland of flowers (7:28, 18); urging Arjuna to cut off
Bhurisravas'* arms from an unseen position to protect Satyaki* (7:117,47-118,2); making it appear that the sun
has set so that Arjuna can kill Jayadratha (7:121); and tricking Karna* into using the weapon he had saved for
Arjuna to kill Ghatotkaca* (7: 154). Each episode has an atmosphere of its own and seems to have been
developed as an independent narrative.

with their allies. After some deliberation, Yudhisthira * turns to Krishna for advice "not incompatible with our
dharma" (svadharmasyavirodhena*; 6: 103, 24). Krishna's answer is the first mention of this episode's dominant
theme, and it comes up in connection with the question of svadharma. It concerns the intricate matter of fulfilling
one's vows. First Krishna offers, in effect, to go against his word, his vow to participate in the battle only as a
noncombatant: "Command me, O Pandava*; out of friendship [sauhardad*] I will fight with Bhisma*.... I will slay
Bhisma* in battle if Arjuna does not wish to do so" (103,28-29). Second, indicating that this matter of vows is of
deepening complexity, he adds: "What was formerly vowed [pratijnatam*] by Arjuna at Upaplavya in the presence
of Uluka*'I will slay the son of Ganga'* [Bhisma*]that vow [vacas] of the intelligent Partha* is to be kept
[pariraksyam] by me. Permitted by Partha*, no doubt it will be accomplished by me. Or else, as this burden is but
moderate for Arjuna in battle, he will slay Bhisma* [himself]" (103,35-37).
In answer, Yudhisthira* will not, of course, cause others to break their vows: "I cannot bear out of regard for my
own goal to make you untruthful [tvamanrtam*]; not fighting, give assistance as you have promised" (103,43). Far
better than making others break their vows is getting them to keep them. Says Yudhisthira*: "A certain agreement
[samaya] was made with Bhisma* by me...: 'For your sake I will advise, but I will not fight in any way .... ' Surely
he is my giver of sovereignty as well as of counsel [sa hi rajyasya* me data* mantrasyaiva ca], O Madhava*"
(103,44-45). Yudhisthira* thus recalls a scene just before the war. Crossing the lines and "taking leave of his
superiors" (gurunanumanya*; 6:41,17 and 18), he had asked the latterBhisma*, Drona*, Krpa*, and Salya*for their
blessings and, in the case of the first two, the means to conquer them.3 To this second request, Bhisma* had
replied: "It is not yet time
3 Hopkins, "Ruling Caste," p. 200, n. 3, and Winternitz, History of Indian Literature, 1, 317, n. 2, all too
easily take this scene as an interpolation.

for my death. Come to me again" (41,43). By keeping Bhisma * to this invitation, or "agreement," it will be
possible to bring about his death. Thus it is no accident that in the remainder of his speech Yudhisthira* places a
high value on Bhisma's* celebrated penchant for keeping vows:4 "Therefore, O Ma-dhusudana*, together with you
we shall all, once again approaching Devavrata ['He whose Vow is Godly'; see n. 4], ask after the means of his
own death .... He will speak words to our advantage, and do so truly [tathyam] ...; as he will say, O Krishna, so
shall I do in battle. Of firm vow[s] [dhrtavrata*5], he is our giver of victory and counsel" (103,45-48).
Krishna's responsecontinuing to accent the interplay of personal commitmentshas an air of shrewdness: "What you
say is always pleasing to me, O long-armed one. Devavrata Bhisma*, active, would scorche [us] by a mere glance
.... He will be able to speak the truth [satyam], especially if asked by you" (103,50-51). Krishna thus puts
Yudhisthira* into a position where an aspect of his own omnivirtuous character becomes the means to an
unvirtuous act. But the aspect in question is not as clearly delineated as it will be in later incidents. We have just
seen that in talking about vows, truth (satya) can serve as the virtue which links Bhisma* and Yudhisthira*.
4 Born with the names Gangadatta* or Gangeya* (as the son of Ganga*) and Devavrata ("Divine Vow";
1:90,50), his most popular name, Bhisma* ("The Terrible"), reflects what the name Devavrata had
anticipated; for, to satisfy his father Samtanu's* desires for more sons and a second wife, "Devavrata"
provided assurance that this wife's sons would have no rivals to the throne by undertaking the divinely
acclaimed "terrible" (bhisma*) vows of renouncing his own title to the throne and of adopting the celibate
brahmacarya mode of life (1:94,77-94). In gratitude, Samtanu* granted him the boon of "death at his own
will" (svacchandamaranam*; 94), that is, indefinite postponement of death.
5 In the Rg* Veda the epithet dhrtavrata* is attached to Varuna* and to Mitravaruna*; see RV* 1:25,6 and 10;
1:44,14; 8:25,2 and 8, and Gonda, Vedic God Mitra, pp. 2 and 29, Schmidt, Vedisch vrata*, pp. 52-54. Gonda's
words (p. 10) that the vrata* relates to "'rules of conduct,' 'observances,' and 'institutions'" and is not primarily
"a verbal affair" are worthy of note; but where the vrata is personal and expressed orally, I see no reason to
reject the translation "vow."

This does not mean, however, that the vow is to be reduced to a form of truth; rather, the latter virtue is the
former's guarantee: one's vows and personal "rules of conduct" (see n. 5) are fulfilled if one is truthful to them.
Yudhisthira *, however, is notlike Arjunarenowned for his vows in a way that might complement Bhisma*. But
they do share a virtue, one being its incarnation and the other, especially after the war, its leading authority: the
virtue of dharma. And, as suggested earlier, there are reasons to regard the vow (vrata) as a specialization of this
more general quality.6
With this correlation in mind, the scene upon the Pandavas'* return visit to Bhisma's* tent gains in depth of
meaning. Greeted profusely by Bhisma*, "Yudhisthira* the son of Dharma, depressed at heart [dinatma*], said: 'O
thou conversant with dharma (dharmajna*), how shall we conquer?'" (103,57-58). And once again, he asks how
Bhisma* might be slain. On the first visit Bhisma* had responded to this question elliptically: "I do not see him
[tam], O Kaunteya, who might conquer me while I am fighting in a challengenot any man [pumankascid*], not
even Satakratu* [Indra] himself" (6:41,41).7 While shows no signs of reading between the lines, it is likely that
Bhisma* is tipping him off that no "male being" (pums*) may slay him. On the second visit, Yudhisthira* seems to
have picked up this apparent riddle when he says: "A slayer of elephant riders, chariot riders, horsemen, and foot
soldiers [narasvara-thanaganam* hantaram*], O slayer of hostile heroes, what man [puman*] is there able to slay
you?" (103,62). This might be phrased: "As you are invincible by men from each of the four divisions of the army,
what man can kill you?"8 It thus seems, from this and a number of other exchanges between Yudhisthira* and
6 ,See above, Chapter 8, at n. 45.
7 See also the variants to 6:41,43: Bhisma* saying in the CE that he knows no "enemy," satrum*, who can slay
him, but many manuscripts retaining what is here the more specific tam, the masculine pronoun.
8 Ganguli-Roy (Mahabharata, V: Bhishma Parva, 290) has "cars, steeds, men, and elephants"; though
gramatically correct, it overlooks the absurdity of slaying "cars."

authorities on dharma, that one of his royal functions is to decipher the often riddlelike character of "subtle [suksma
*] dharma." The exchange with Bhisma* is thus the third in a series of incidents involving what might be called
royal dharmic riddles.9 This would include not only the riddle test of Yudhisthira* by the Yaksa*, Dharma
incarnate.10 When the Pandavas* are on their way to the lacquer house, Vidura, another incarnation of Dharma,
tells Yudhisthira* of the trap Duryodhana has set for them, communicating with Yudhisthira* through a series of
riddles that only the two of them can understand (1:133,18-29). Moreover, in all of these cases, Yudhisthira* is
able to "save" his brothers.
So far, then, the drama of the vows has developed through three phases: first, Krishna's promptings recalling his
and Arjuna's vows; second, Yudhisthira's* reflections, recalling the vows of Bhisma*; and third, Yudhisthira's*
confrontation of Bhisma*, with whom he has a special dharmic rapport, to fulfill an earlier vow or promise.
Bhisma's* answer leads to a fourth phase. The only way to slay the unslayable Bhisma* will be through one of his
own vows. On certain conditions, which he lays down with precision, he would be indisposed to fight:
With [literally, "in"] one who has abandoned his weapon or fallen down, with one whose standard or armor
is loosed, with one who is fleeing or terrified, or who says "I am yours," with women or with one having a
woman's name [striyam* strinamadheye* ca], with one who is maimed or who has but one son, with one
who has not produced offspring [? aprasute*] or who is disagreeable to look at[with these] battle is not
pleasing to me [na yuddham* rocate mama]. [103,72-73]
There is nothing unusual in this list, echoing other guidelines for fair combat,11 except for the references to
women. On this

between the various priests (SB* 13,5,2, 11-22), but the last one asked of the adhvaryu by the royal
sacrificer (3).

point Bhisma * has more to say: "Listen, O Partha*, to this resolution [or vow; samkalpam*] of mine, formerly
thought out. Having seen an inauspicious sign [or "banner"; amangalyadhvajam*; cf. 103,78], I will never fight"
(103,74). Bhisma* makes it explicit that, in particular, his "resolution" concerns the "inauspicious sign" of one who
was "formerly a woman, afterwards a man" (stri* purvam* pascatpums*; 103,76), that is, the Panca1a* prince
Sikhandin*.12
From here on, as Bhisma* maps out his own death, the final phase of this episode is one of deepening irony. First,
Bhisma* hints at the reversals in virtues that his proposed "means of death" will involve for the two principal
Pandavas*. As for Indra's son: "Let Arjuna, coated in mail, heroic in battle [samare surah*], having placed
Sikhandin* before him, attack me quickly with arrows" (103,77). As for Dharma's son (resorting here not to the
Critical Edition but to several Devanagari* manuscripts13): "Do this, O Kaunteya, as indicated, O thou of excellent
vows [suvrata]; then will you conquer the assembled Dhartarastras* in battle" (103,82). Despite his overall
allegiance to dharma, Yudhisthira* uses vows only in a way that he will later judge to be sinful;14 and Arjuna will
not show much heroism having to fight from behind another's back.
The last touch is then applied by Krishna. When the "sinless" Arjuna, "burning with grief and feeling shame"
(duhkhasamtaptah* savridam*; 84), rejects the part assigned him, Krishna draws everything full circle: "Having
formerly vowed
12 See 5:170ff; Sikhandin* was in his previous life the princess Amba* of Kasi*, one of three sisters whom
Bhisma* abducted from their Svayamvara* to be his half-brother Vicitravirya's* wives; but as Amba* had
chosen another man, King Sa1va* (see Chapter 4), she was allowed to leave and go to him. When he would
not accept a once-abducted woman, however, she became an ascetic and obtained a boon from Siva*
enabling her to be reborn as a man so as to exact her revenge against Bhisma*.
13 The CE reads yathoktam* vacanam mama for yathoktam mama suvrata, the latter seemingly an insightful
variant or alteration.
14 This would seem to be the unspecified sin referred to and lamented in his mea culpa; see above, Chapter 9,
at and following n. 26.

Bhisma's * death in battle [pratijnaya* vadham ... pura bhismasya* samyuge*], O Jisnu*, firm in the duty of a
ksatriya* [ksatradharme* sthitah*], how can you not kill him?" (103,90). Not only is the link drawn once again
between vows and dharma; we are taken back to the first phase of this drama where Krishna had offered to break
his own vow in order to fulfill Arjuna's vow for him.
In summary, Yudhisthira* appears guilty of a misuse of the vow.
Death of Drona*
On the fifth day of Drona's* marshalship, the Pandavas*, seeing the great carnage brought on by Drona's* prowess
and Arjuna's reluctance to oppose him, despair of victory. Krishna then confers with Arjuna on how to get Drona*
to lay aside his weapons: "Casting aside virtue [dharmamutsrjya*], ... let a device be adopted for victory"
(asthiyatam* jaye yogo; 7:164,68). Someone, he says, should tell Drona* that Asvatthaman*, his son, has fallen;
then he will desist. Although Arjuna does not approve of this advice, everyone else does, and Yudhisthira* accepts
it "with difficulty" (krcchrena*; 164,70). This is reminiscent of the behavior of these two in the slaying of
Bhisma*: Arjuna "grieved and ashamed," Yudhisthira* grieved but calculating. Bhima* then slays a terrible
elephant named Asvatthaman* and announces treacherously that someone with that name has fallen. But Drona*,
not believing Bhima*, continues to fight. Then a host of famous Rsis* descends toward Drona* to discourage him
from further fighting. Twice urging him to lay down his weapons, their main argument is that he has overstepped
the boundaries of caste:15 "You are fighting unrighteously [adharmatas]. This is the time for your death ....
Henceforth you should not perform this most cruel karman
15 The argument is repeated by Bhima* (7:165,28-32), and upon hearing it again (along with Yudhisthira's*
confirmation of Asvatthaman's* death) Drona* lays down his arms. It is raised again by Dhrstadyumna* (7:
168,23-24) to justify his part in the killing, especially in the words, "fallen off from his svadharma, he took
up ksatradharma*" (24).

again. Knowing the Vedas and Vedangas * and having the virtue of truth as your chief object
[satyadharmaparasya], especially being a brahmin, this [fighting] is not suitable for you" (164,89-92). Hearing
these words, which call attention to Drona's* allegiance to "truth," Drona* cheerlessly asks Yudhisthira* whether
Asvatthaman* has been slain or not, for, according to the narrator Samjaya*: "Drona* had firm knowledge [sthira*
buddhir] that Yudhisthira* would not speak an untruth [anrtam*], even for the sake of the sovereignty of the three
worlds [trayanamapi* lokanamaisvaryarthe*]. Therefore he asked him especially, and no one else, for in this
Pandava*, beginning with childhood, Drona* surely had his hope for truth" (satyasa*; 164,95-96).
As we saw in Chapters 7 and 8, this "sovereignty over the three worlds" is often (and sometimes by Krishna) said
to require certain virtues. This seems to be Drona's* assumption here (as it will also be Arjuna's), and he is
attentive above all to the virtue of "truth." But in Krishna the opposite assumption now seems to be operative:
sovereignty also requires sins. Thus he tells Yudhisthira* that a lie is his only course: "Save us from Drona*.
Untruth may be better than truth [satyajjyayo* 'nrtam* bhavet]. By telling an untruth for the saving of life, untruth
does not touch one" (na sprsyate* 'nrtah*>; 98-99). Bhima* also tells Yudhisthira* that he is known "in the world
of men as one who is truthful" (satyavanhi* nrloke*; 104); and, after some deliberation, Yudhisthira* is ready:
"Sunk in the fear of untruth [atathyabhaye mange] but clinging to victory [jaye sakto], Yudhisthira* said to him
[Dorna*] inaudibly [avyaktam]: 'An elephant is slain.'16 Before this his chariot had remained four fingers above
the earth, but when he said this his vehicle touched the earth" (tasya purvam* rathah* prthvyascaturangula*
uttarah* / babhuvaivam* tu
16 Ganguli-Roy (VI, 448): "Yudhishthira distinctly said that Asvatthaman was dead, adding indistinctly the
word elephant"; thus drawing from the later description of the episode by Krpa* (165,115-16), no doubt
fairly, for Yudhisthira* has certainly conveyed to Drona* the first part of this message even if the text
records only the qualification.

tenokte tasya vahasprsanmahim *; 106-7). Soon, after more bloodshed, Drona* lays down his weapons, seats
himself on his chariot where he devotes himself to yoga, and tranquilly ascends to Brahmaloka before the head is
cut from his lifeless body by his determined adversary, the Pancala* prince Dhrstadyumna* (165,33-47).
This illustrates the main point: that, similar to the way that he caused Bhisma's* death by a misuse of the vow,
Yudhisthira* slays Drona* by a misuse of the truthin this case an actual lie. But, most intriguing and equally
significant is the amplification of this episode in its retelling and immediate aftermath.
The first to retell it is Krpa*, Drona's* brother-in-law and fellow fighting brahmin, who must break the news to
Asvatthaman*. On the whole he is quite "accurate," repeating certain of Samjaya's* phrases almost word for
word.17 However, in one point he adds and in another he subtracts. Yudhisthira's* lie is given a fuller treatment;
not only is its inaudible part cited (see note 16), but the "loudly" spoken part is given as well: "He for whose sake
you bear weapons and looking upon whom you live, your ever-cherished son Asvatthaman* has been overthrown"
(165,16). Thus the lie appears in a much starker and more "disagreeable" form, evoking the leave-taking scene
before the war in which Drona* tells Yudhisthira* how he may be conquered: "I shall abandon my weapon in
battle having heard something very disagreeable" (sumahadapriyam; 6:41,61). One gets the impression that Drona*
stops fighting in grief not so much for his son but because, as one who is "clear-sighted into the nature of the
world" (lokatattvavicaksanah*; 165, 119), he has at last heard these "greatly disagreeable" (mahadapriyam;
165,117) words. As to his omission, Krpa* leaves out the visit of the Rsis* and the ascent to Brahmalokathe latter
with significant repercussions.
When Asvatthaman* reacts, the focus of blame begins to shift. Having heard not only about Yudhisthira's* lie but
about

Dhrstadyumna's * dastardly act of seizing Drona's* hair and cutting off his head, thinking that the latter is not
merely an indignity (paribhava; 166,24) but the physical cause of Drona's* death,18 he wavers between blaming
the one and blaming the other. His first words are undoubtedly as scathing a repudiation of Yudhisthira* as one
will find: "How my father was slain by wretches [ksudrair*] when he had put down his weapons, how a sin
[papam*] was perpetrated by one bearing the banner of virtue [dharmadhvajavata*],19 this is known to me; I have
heard about the dishonorable act of the very mischievous son of Dharma" (anaryam* sunrsamsasya*
dharmaputrasya; 166, 19). Nowhere is the ambiguity of his status as Dharmaraja* more apparent. But
Asvatthaman's* disgust with Yudhisthira* is overshadowed by his rage at Dhrstadyumna*, leading him to utter the
fateful vow that will result in the latter's death (106,28-29).
The compass of blame turns back one more time toward Yudhisthira* and then jumps wildly in all directions as a
quarrel breaks out among the Pandavas* and their allies over the responsibility for this and other sins. In Arjuna's
speech the blame swings toward Yudhisthira*, and here we have the reaction of the most sin-conscious of all the
Pandavas* to Yudhisthira's* most glaring sin. His insights do not disappoint us. For one thing, in leveling the brunt
of the blame at Yudhisthira*, Arjuna sees his brother's sin against the background of the royal virtues: "The guru
was attended upon falsely by you for the sake of sovereignty [mithya* bhavata*
18 The CE clears up a source of confusion here: Drona's ascent, says Sarmjaya*, was seen by only five
men: "I myself, Arjuna, the brahmin Krpa*, son of Saradvat, Krishna, and Yudhisthira*" (165,42-43). It
was not observed by Asvatthaman* (bharadvajasya* catmaja*), whom many Northern manuscripts
substitute for Krpa*. One can only wonder at Krpa's* silence; he lets Asvatthaman* think that Drona* has
gone (merely) to viraloka*, "the world of heroes" (166,22).
19 See Ganguli-Roy (VI, 400, n. 1): "Dharmadhvajin, literally means a person bearing the standard of virtue;
hence, a hypocrite, sanctimoniously talking only virtue and morality but acting differently"; cf. Hopkins,
"Ruling Caste," p. 246.

rajyakaranat *]; indeed, by being conversant with dharma [dharmnajnena* sata*], very great is the adharma you
performed. [Thinking:] 'This son of Pandu* is endowed with every virtue [sarvadharmopapanno] and is my
disciple; he will not speak falsely,' he put his trust in you" (167,33-34). This, in effect, verifies the assumption I
attributed to Drona* earlier: that Drona* would expect the virtue of "truth" in an omnivirtuous pretender to world
sovereignty and that he could rely on him for its exercise. Moreover, Arjuna is adept at detecting oppositions. Not
only has Yudhisthira* used dharma to perform adharma; more specifically, Arjuna charges Yudhisthira* with
"untruth in the garb of truth" (satyakancukam* ... anrtam*; 35).
Most intriguing, Arjuna is convinced that this sin and these oppositions affect not only Yudhisthira* but all the
brothers. He thus accepts the guilt even while protesting his own innocence: "Surely while I was crying out
vehemently, eagerly longing for the guru, having discarded his own dharma [avakirya* svadharmam] the disciple
slew the guru. When the greater part of our life is gone and only the shortest time remains, now this great injustice
[adharmo ... mahan*] has caused even its [the remainder's] disfigurement" (vikara*; 167,41-42). Again: "Harm
was done to this old guru, ever our benefactor, by ourselves [asmabhih*], dishonorable and of trifling insight, for
the sake of sovereignty" (167,47).
Such admissions point to a delicate balance: just as "all the virtues" (which, Arjuna says, Drona* ascribed to
Yudhisthira* in this very scene) are to be found not only in Yudhisthira* singly but in the Pandavas* collectively,
so too is there a sharing of the royal sins. Both are intertwined with the symbolism of sovereignty, and this
symbolismas we have seen as far back as our discussions of Sri* and Draupadi*is shared by the king with his
brothers. All are "Indras among men."
Death of Karna*
One of the factors leading to the death of the third Kuru marshal, Karna*, was outlined at the end of Chapter 9:

Yudhisthira's * scheme to have Salya* destroy Karna's* "energy" (tejovadhas; 5:8,27 and 6:41,81) in battle. From
this, an important measure of the responsibility for Karna's* death belongs to Yudhisthira*. In fact, thinking at one
point that Karna* is dead, Yudhisthira* exults at the elimination of this most personally troubling of all his foes:
Thirteen years have passed through which, terrified [bhita*], O Dhanamjaya*, I obtained neither sleep at
night nor comfort [sukham] by day. Filled with hatred for him, I burn [tasya dvesena* samyuktah*
paridahye] .... My time has passed reflecting on how I might destroy Karna* in battle. Waking and
sleeping, O son for Kunti*, I always see Karna*; indeed, this universe has everywhere become Karna*
[tatra tatraiva karnabhutamidam* jagat]. Truly, wherever I go, terrified by Karna*, O Dhanamjaya*, there
I surely behold Karna* before me. [8:46,16-20]
But to fix the motive and place the blame does not clarify the nature of the crime. For this we must examine the
repercussions of Yudhisthira's* scheme, that is, the favor he exacted from Salya*.
On the morning of the second and last day of Karna's* marshalship, after a frustrating first day, Duryodhana and
Karna* agree (as Yudhisthira* had foreseen) that the latter's only chance against Arjuna will be to have Salya* as
his charioteer (8,22). Finally persuaded, Salya* is thus provided with the occasion to begin the "destruction of
Karna's* energy" as the two set out for the crucial duel. This he does, first by scorning, one might even say
"satirizing,"20 Karna's* courage and eagerness to fight (8:27,18-27). Karna's* answer is the first articulation of the
theme around which this episode revolves and which stems directly from Yudhisthira's* intrigues: "Relying on my
20 His rebukes culminate in a series of comparisons: Karna* is to Arjuna as a jackal to a lion, a mouse to a
cat, as falsehood to truth, as poison to amrta* (8:27,5o-52); see Donald Ward's "On the Poets and Poetry of
the Indo-Europeans," JIES, I (1973), 127-44, on the archaic character of satire and invective verse (think of
the suta*, "charioteer," as bard!) in Indo-European societies.

own vigor [viryam *], I am seeking Arjuna in battle. But you, an enemy with the face of a friend [mitramukhah*
satruh*], seek to terrify me" (27,28). The death of Karna* will involve a betrayal of friendship.
When Salya's* rebukes become still more stinging, Karna* says that he is prepared for whatever may happen and
begins to trade insults of his own:
You are evil-natured, foolish, unskilled in great battles. Overcome with fear, out of terror you utter such
nonsense. Or you are praising them for some other reason, O you who are born in a bad country
[kudesaja*]. Having slain them in battle, I will certainly slay you together with all your kinsmen. O you
who are born in a sinful country [papadesaja*], you mean-minded low defiler of the ksatriya* class
[durbuddhe ksudra* ksatriyapamsana*], having become a friend [suhrd*], why, like an enemy, do you
frighten me with the two Krsnas*? [8:27,66-68]
Two aspects of the theme of friendship have surfaced here, which it will be best to treat separately: the evocation
of the two Krsnas* and the references to the wickedness of Salya's* homeland.
First, it is to the credit of Walter Ruben to have noticed that this "insult contest between Salya* as charioteer and
Karna*" is "a caricature-like counterpart to the Bhagavad Gita*.21 Nowhere is this contrast more apparent than
when Karna* sets out with Salya*supposedly the most skillful of charioteersat the reins, and the horses tumble to
the ground (8:26,36). Throughout the episode are consistent references to parallels and contrasts between the
relationship of Arjuna and Krishna and that of Karna* and Salya*. Indeed, Krishna and Salya* have been observed
as a pair before: both maternal relatives of the Pandavas*, and each responding differently to the elaborate sabhas*
constructed by the Kauravas to win them over or impress them.22 Now it is another comparison, made by Karna*,
that

tells us why Karna * himself requests Duryodhana to assign Salya* as his driver: "Surely Salya* is superior to
Krishna and surely I am superior to Arjuna. As [Krishna] knows horsemanship..., even so does Salya* .... As there
is no bow-bearer equal to myself with weapons, so there is no one equal to Salya* in the guiding of horses"
(8:22,53-56). Using these lines of flattery, Duryodhana at last gets Salya* to agree (23,48-50). And finally, as they
are about to fight, each warrior asks his driver what he would do should his companion die. While Salya* says he
will slay both Krishna and Arjuna (74), Krishna says smilingly that if such a thing should occur it would mean the
"overturning of the world" (lokaparyasanam), and adds, only as a sort of afterthought, that he would slay both
Karna* and Salya* (77).
If there is a lesson in these contrasts, it would seem to be that Arjuna and Krishna's success will be related to their
true friendship, while Karna* and Salya's* failure will be related to their false friendship. The friendship of Arjuna
and Krishna thus merits some attention. Here, it is not solely a matter of their mystical identity as Nara and
Narayana*.23 Rather, we are concerned with a specific social or dharmic bond. In the beginning of Chapter 6, I
sought to differentiate levels of Krishna's self-disclosure in the Gita*: first, in the fourth chapter, having to do with
dharma and the yuga structure; and second, in the
23 Since I discuss Arjuna and Krishna's relationship mainly through their identifications as Indra's son and
Visnu's* avatara*, a few words are due on their other identification: whereas the Indra-Visnu*
transposition can be traced to the Rg* Veda, the Nara-Narayana* identification seems rooted in more recent
themes. Narayana* appears first in name in SB* 12,3,4 and 13,6,1 and then not again (unmentioned in
Upanisads*) until the epic. Biardeau has offered the most convincing discussion (EMH, 1, pp. 33-37; 2, pp.
68-80; 3, pp. 48-56; Clefs, pp. 156, 224), seeing the god Purusa-Narayana* of SB* as the model for the pair
Nara-Narayana* (purusa* = nara in the epic); see also van Buitenen, The Mahabarata*, I, xxi and 435, n.
1.0. Guesses at Narayana's* origins do not inspire confidence; see R. G. Bhandarkar, Vaisnavism*,
Saivism*, and Minor Religious Systems (1913; repr. Benares: Indo-logical Book House, 1965), pp. 35-38;

eleventh chapter where Krishna discloses himself as Kala * (Time), with moksa*, bhakti, and the kalpa structure.
Recalling that at the end of the eleventh chapter, Krishna says he reveals his universal form only to his bhaktas
(11,54), let us now note why he tells Arjuna of his role concerning the maintenance of dharma from yuga to yuga:
This very same by Me to thee today,
This ancient discipline, is proclaimed.
Thou art my devotee and friend [bhakto 'si me sakha* ca], that is why;
For this is a supreme secret. [4,3]
Friendship (sakhyam) is thus a suitable relationship for understanding Krishna's dharmic role, but, as Arjuna says,
it is not adequate to carry the devotional appreciation of Krishna in his universal form. Thus, after the theophany,
Arjuna apologizes for his earlier familiarity with Krishna, that is, as he puts it, for:
Whatever I said rashly, thinking thee my boon companion [sakhe 'ti matva*],
Calling Thee "Krsna*, Yadava*, Companion (sakhe) !" [ 11,41 ]
Arjuna is, of course, forgiven his familiarities, and he stands as the exemplar of both of these relationships to
Krishna: those of sakhi and bhakta, the former implying a variety of social and dharmic relations,24 the latter a
means to salvation. In fact, the Gita* seems to reserve the word sakhi solely for the "companionship" of Arjuna
and Krishna and to use other terms where "friendship" is discussed more generally.25 The term, however, is one
with a "prehistory." As seen in Chapter 9, it describes the relationship between Indra and Vrtra*, or, in variants,
between Indra and Namuci.26 Karna* uses it, although not
24 Cf. Ganguli-Roy (Mahabharata, XII: Asvamedha Parva, 166, n. 1): "Draupadi was always styled by
Krisha as his 'sakhi' or 'friend.'"

is first told about Indra and Namuci;

exclusively, to address Salya *. And, with some likely Indo-European parallels, it provides a key term in Dumézil's
analysis of the typical sinthe breaking of a "friendship" or warrior pactcommitted, as it was by Indra, against the
second function. As Dumézil puts it: "The translation 'friendship' is inadequate, but it is difficult to establish with
precision the variety of social relationship which the word sakhiprobably from the same root as the Latin
sociussignifies."27
It seems, then, that the poets have found in the "insult contest" between Karna* and Salyatogether on a chariot
before their crucial battlea perfect counterpart to the exemplary communication between Arjuna and Krishna in the
Gita*. One friend offers encouragement, the other discouragement. Against such a background of contrasts
concerning two warriors and their charioteers the Mahabharata* amplifies the theme of friendship to its fullest
extent.
Turning back to the insult contest, we can afford to be much briefer on the second matter raised by Karna's* first
denunciationthe wickedness of Salya's* homelandfor it will claim our attention later. Karna* sees this baseness as
the very reason why "true" friendship with Salya* is impossible: "Madrakas are always injurers of friends
[mitradhrun]; whoever hates us, he is a Madraka. There is, in a Madraka of mean speech, the lowest of men, no
friendship" (or "alliance," "association": samgatam*; 8:27,73; cf. 83-84). And then friendship (sauhardam*,
samgatam*) is discussed (27,79-83) alongside ritual purity (saucam*; 80), with the analogy drawn that friendship
with a "fickle" or "dirty"28 Madras is as much a degradation as the failure to observe caste rules in sacrifices.

Karna *, however, continues still further with this surgery of "friendship." Other figures are involved: "I am the
dear friend [priyah* sakha*] of the intelligent son of Dhrtarastra* [Duryodhana]. Surely my life-breaths [pranah*]
and whatever wealth is mine exist for his sake. Evidently you have been consigned by the Pandavas*, you offspring
of a sinful land, since you have behaved toward us in every way like a foe" (amitravat; 27,94-95). The fabric of
"friendships" which holds this episode together is thus further complicated. One might put Karna's* position into
the following formula: for his own true friend, he must fight against a pair of true friends and thus face death by
letting a false friend live. As he says himself, concluding his first denunciation of Salya*: "Out of regard for a
friend [mitrapratiksya*], for Duryodhana's sake, and so as not to endure blamefor these three reasons [I let] you
live" (27,102). But more than this, Karna* is the tragic model of true, loyal friendship,29 even though Salya*,
claiming to speak as a friend (suhrd*; 28,2), holds his loyalty up to ridicule. Through his dedication to
Duryodhana, Karna* can answer Salya* with authoritative words on friendship:
Surely friendship is seven-paced [saptapadam* hi mitram].30... Duryo-dhana has come to battle himself.
Desiring success for his sake, I long for him where there is no singleness of purpose [? tamabhyesye yatra
naikantyamasti*]. Friendship [mitram] consists of making fat [mider], gladdening [nandater], or pleasing
[priyater*], or protecting [samtrayater*], or rejoicing [modater];... and all this, no less, is mine in
29 Just before the battle, Karna* tells Krishna: "I will do nothing disagreeable to the son of Dhrtarastra*;
know me surely to have abandoned life desiring Duryodhana's welfare" (6:41,87).
30 There does not seem to be any numerical correlation with what follows. On the "seven-paced friendship,"
see also 3:246,35 and 281,22; 13:51,35 and 105,8 (the word for "friend" being consistently mitra). According
to Ganguli-Roy (Mahabharata, XI, 189, n. 1): "The sense... is that if the righteous meet and exchange seven
words (or walk each other for only seven steps), they become friends." Cf. the seven steps in the Hindu
marriage rite.

Duryodhana. Enmity consists of destruction, punishment, putting down, crushing, swelling [? with pride;
svayater *], or even by weakening the will through repeatedly visiting misfortune. And, in general, all this
is in you toward me. [29,21-25]
Karna* and Duryodhana's friendship dates back to their first encounter (1:126,38). And in several manuscripts,
from both North and South, it is "through the condition of friendship" (sakhibhavena*) that Duryodhana is finally
able to prevail upon Karna* to stop the insult contest.31
This suffices to demonstrate that the theme of friendship is central to the events leading to the death of the third
senapati*. There also is evidenceof a most baffling naturethat the epic's poets (or at least some of its redactors) saw
a definite link between this episode and Indra's triumph over Vrtra* or Namuci. The uncertainty lies in the
surprising fact that all but one of the references to such a connection occur only in the Northern recension. I will
thus refer to this one instance first, as it provides the Critical Edition's only support for this causeway between
myth and epic.
After Karna* has had some initial success in baffling Arjuna's weapons, Bhima* and Krishna take turns addressing
Arjuna (8:65,14-21). Both urge him to recover his "firmness" (dhrti*; 18 and 20), and both, in effect, offer him the
service of their weapons. Bhima* volunteers to do the job himself with his mace (gada*; 15); and then Krishna,
observing that Arjuna is not winning the fight with his usual independent flair, proposes: "Cut off the head of this
foe, putting forth strength, with this razor-edged Sudarsana* [Krishna's cakra], entrusted by me [to you], as Sakra*
with his vajra [cut off the head] of the foe Namuci" (anena ... ksuranemina*. . . maya* nisrstena* sudarsanena*
vajrena* sakro* namucerivareh*; 65, 18-19). These invitations to rely on others' weapons are, of course, rejected
by Arjuna, who calls upon his own resources (23). But the comparison reminds
31Karnaparvan*, 401*, line 7, following 8:30,86.

us that Arjuna will rely on Krishna here just as Indra relied on others,32 and in Salya's * Udyogaparvan account
specifically upon Visnu* (who enters Indra's "weapon," the frothy vajra; 5:10,39),33 in his disloyal dealings with
Vrtra* and Namuci.
To be sure, this convergence of themes concerning the rein-forcement of Indra and Arjuna's weapons is not enough
to go on. The battle scenes abound in descriptions comparing heroic opponents to Indra and his foes, and in this
particular duel comparisons are made to Indra's combats with many other enemies besides Namuci and Vrtra*.34
Yet, as a glance at Sörensen's Index will show, the description of Arjuna and Karna's* duel that appears in the
Northern recension "Vulgate" includes five out of the forty-two references to Vrtra* that occur in all the four battle
parvans and four of the ten references that are made in the same immense span to Namuci. The latter, at least, is a
significant statistic, inviting a closer look at the strange, apparently intrusive references that occur only in the
Northern recension.35 They are given here in order and in brief.
First, Krishna warns Arjuna of Karna's* approach: "Slay Karna*, O mighty-armed one, as Vrtrahan* [Indra,
"Slayer of Vrtra*"] [slew] Namuci. Let good fortune [sreyas*] be yours, O Partha*; obtain victory in battle"
(Appendix I, no. 36, 11. 31-32 = Calcutta Edition 8:86,4363). Second, when Karna's* chariot wheel is engulfed by
the earth and Arjuna is reluctant to slay him at a disadvantage, Krishna mocks such chivalry: "When he is able, the
suta's* son [Karna*] will encounter you
32 In SB* 12,7,3,3 (cf. RV* 10,131,4-5), Indra gets his help from the Asvins* and Saravati*; see
Bloomfield, "Indra and Namuci," pp. 147,151,153-60, and 162; and Dumézil, Destiny of the Warrior, p. 31.
33 See above, Chapter 9, at n. 14; Gonda's atmospheric interpretation is unconvincing: Early Visnuism, p. 38.
34 Arjuna and Karna* are compared to Indra and Bali (8:63,5; 65,5), Indra and Sambara* (63,19 and 63; 64,8),
Indra and Jambha (64,11), and Indra and Bala (66,30).
35 The only Southern exception, one in Telegu script referred to as T2, is described by P. L. Vaidya (ed., CE,
Karnaparvan*, "Introduction," p. xviii) as "showing signs of the influence of the N recension."

as before. Strike this one as Hari [Visnu-Krishna *36] struck Namuci" (vidhya tvam enam* namucim* yatha*
harih*; App. I, no. 41, 11. 19-20 = Calcutta Edition 8:90,4700). When Arjuna finally slays the disabled Karna*,
the narrator's comparison is still pointed, though this time referring not to Namuci but to Vrtra*: "Then Arjuna
removed [Karna's*] head as Indra [removed] Vrtra's* with the vajra" (tato 'rjunasya siro* jahara* vrtrasya*
vajrena* yatha* mahendrah*; 8,1159* = Calcutta Edition 8:91,4798). And finally, at the beginning of the last
adhyaya* of the parvan, Krishna launches the Pandavas*' victory celebration with an embrace of Arjuna and the
most mystifying words of all:37 "Slain by the destroyer of Bala was Vrtra*, by you Karna* [hato balabhida*
vrtrastvaya* karno*], O Dhanamjaya*. Men shall talk of just [one] death for Karna* and Vrtra* [vadham* vai
karnavrtrabhyam* kathayisyanti manavah*].38 Vrtra* was slain in battle by the much-splendored [bhuritejasa*]
bearer of the vajra; by you, then, was Karna* slain with bow and sharp arrows" (8:69,2-3).
What is one to make of these consistencies? All of the passages cited except for the first are exclusively Northern,
although it might be argued that the last and most crucial passage is ancient and that the Southern recension has
replaced it with a different ending (see note 37). But to account for all the passages, perhaps one must suppose that
at some comparatively recent date, the Northern redactors seized upon the initial allusion, the only one definitely

known," mythical and secret. Although there is more than one possibility,39 it is most likely that the true point of
Krishna's insistence that "men shall talk of just one death for Karna * and Vrtra*" is that each was undone by the
same device: a violation of friendship encouraged and reinforced by his opponent's closest "friend."
As is well known, in the Rg* Veda, Visnu* is Indra's "intimate friend" (índrasya yujyah* sakha*; RV* 1,22,19), his
frequent ally against Vrtra*; and in one celebrated passage, when Indra is about to slay Vrtra*, he says: "Friend
Visnu*, stride out widely" (sákhe visno* vitaram* ví kramasva; 4,19,11).40 Similarly, in the Mahabharata's*
Udyogaparvan account, Visnu* helps Indra by entering the foam of the waters which Indra combines with his
vajra. No doubt this is the point where the Vrtra* cycle fuses with the Namuci cycle: Indra's friendship with
Visnu* coming from the former, his broken friendship coming from the latter. In any case, it seems that on the epic
plane Indra's role has been divided between the two most prominent of the Mahabharata's* "Indras among men."
On the one hand, just as Indra is helped by his "friend" Visnu* to kill Vrtra*, Arjuna is helped by his "friend"
Krishna to kill Karna*. Indeed, the accounts contain a similar pattern concerning the reinforcement of the two
warriors' weapons. Arjuna does not use the cakra proffered by Krishna, whereas Indra does use the reinforced
vajra. But it seems that Arjuna's weapons have taken effect only after Krishna has spoken, that is, after they have
been reinforced by his words.
39 Both Karna* and Namuci have a rapport with Surya*: Karna* is Surya's* son; Namuci's falling out with
Indra, according to certain versions, began when, "terrified by Vasava*, Namuci entered a ray of the sun
[suryarasmim*]; then Indra made friendship [sakhyam] and an agreement [samayam] with him" (Mbh.
9:42,29; cf. MS 4,3,4 and Bloomfield, "Indra and Namuci," p. 147). On sun-storm imagery in the Karna-
Arjuna* duel, see Dumézil, ME, I, 131,135-38.

On the other hand, Indra's sin of a breach of friendship is not Arjuna's; it is Yudhisthira's *. If Bhisma* has been
slain by a misuse of the vow and Drona* by a misuse of the truth, Karna* has been slain by a misuse of friendship.
The latter theme has had both distant mythical echoes and more recent devotional amplifications. But at bottom it
is still Yudhisthira's* fault that has brought it all about, for it is he who urged Salya* to destroy Karna's* "energy,"
an actinvolving a betrayal of "friendship"which Yudhisthira* himself admitted "ought not to be done"
(akartavyam).41 One might thus draw the following representation of what has occurred on the two planes of myth
and epic:
If Duryodhana stands behind the false friends as a true friend, Yudhisthira* stands behind the true friends as a false
friend, not only of Karna* but of Salya*. Once again, Arjuna remains "pure."
When it is Salya's* turn to be named senapati*, there is a final touch of irony; as Duryodhana puts it: "The time
has come, O you who are devoted to friends, when among friends wise men examine carefully for friendship or
enmity" (... mitranam* mitravatsala / yatra mitramamitram* va* pariksante* budha* janah*; 9:5,23). Salya* is
thus put to the test of friendship and fatefully

accepts. But this is a reflection of the symbolism of Karna's * fall; the symbolism of Salya's* lies elsewhere.
Death of Salya*
Salya* is related symbolically to the earth, as shown by the poets' description of the symbols on the banners
(dhvajas) of the heroes (7:80,2-29): "On the standard-top of Salya*, king of Madra, like the tip of a flame
[agnisikhamiva*], we beheld a golden furrow [sitam*], incomparable and splendid" (7:80,18). Although this
emblem is mentioned just once, its significance is not to be underestimated.42 Salya* stands out from the rest not
only by his earth-related emblem, but by being the only warrior to bear a feminine device on his banner.43
As one might expect, this is likely to be a very rich symbolism, first because it is the Earth's distressher complaint
to the gods that she was being oppressed by an overpopulation of incarnated Asuras (1:58)that has led to the
incarnation of the gods on earth and to the entire war. One underlying fact relates Salya* to her: he has been cast in
the part of the one king outside the central Kuru kingdom who represents "all the other kings of the earth." This
claim finds support in the following three passages, two of which were cited in Chapter 8. First, when Salya* is
selected by Asvatthaman* to be the fourth marshal, his royal nature is emphasized in the familiarbut unusual for
those outside the Kuru lineformulaic way: "This one, with [his] lineage [kulam], heroism [viryam], majesty [tejas],
42 Such passages are not to be treated lightly; cf. Bhisma's* evaluation of the prowess of each hero in the
"tale of the rathas and atirathas" (5:162,17-169,13) and the description of the colors of the heroes' horses
(7:22). One might call them visual aids. On the dhvaja, see F. B. J. Kuiper, review of J. Duchesne-
Guillemin's Symbols and Values in Zoroastrianism, IIJ, XI (1968-1969), 153-57.
43 Sita*, "furrow," is not only a feminine word but a term connoting feminine imagery. The father of the
Ramayana's* Sita*, who was born from a furrow, is called the "plough-bannered" (siradhvaja*); see Jaiswal,
Origin and Development, p. 127.

fame [yasas *], and prosperity [sri*], is endowed with every virtue; let Salya* be our leader" (9:5,18). Second,
Salya's* death is linked with Duryodhana's loss of his royal sri*. At Salya's* death, the Pandavas* rejoice that
"Duryodhana has today been abandoned by his blazing royal prosperity" (hino* diptaya* nrpatisriya*; 9:18,14),44
and acclaim: "Who other than Yudhisthira* son of Prtha*, whose protector is Hrsikesa* [Krishna]ever the refuge of
dharma and fame [dharmayasonidhih*]ever conquer Bhisma*, Drona*, and Karna*, and even the king of the
Madras as also other heroic kings by hundreds and thousands?" (tathan-yannrpatinviransataso* 'tha sahasrasah*;
18,26-27). Finally, this way of referring to Salya* as the index to the other kings is found when Sisupala* berates
Bhisma* and the Pandavas* for honoring Krishna as the most worthy person present at Yudhisthira's* Rajasuya*:
"Why do you not praise the rulers of the earth, Salya* and so forth ?" (salyadin* api kasmat* tvam* stausi*
vasudhadhipan*; 2:41,13). Salya* thus rounds out the four senapatis* as the figure heading the countless rajas* of
the earth. In this light, it is not so strange that with his fall, Duryodhana's sri* abandons him even while he is alive;
for all the earth's kings are no longer there to sustain Duryodhana as sovereign and yield to him the earth's
"prosperity."
One feature differentiates Salya's* death from those of the other marshals, as observed by Walter Ruben. Salya* is
slain by Yudhisthira* alone; and the victory is achieved "in righteous combat."45 According to Ruben, this was
evidence that the original war took place without Krishna, but Krishna is not so easily set aside. When Yudhisthira*
hears the shouts of acclamation at Salya's* installation, he asks Krishna what to do. Once again, Krishna gives the
advice which is to achieve the immediate end, only this time Yudhisthira* is to be the sole agent in carrying it out.
There are two key points in Krishna's

rather long speech (9:6,24-37). First, he stresses twice the continuity between Salya * and the other marshals, but
in contrary directions: in one case Salya* is compared favorably with the others (26), in the other unfavorably:
"Having crossed the Bhisma*, Karna*, and Drona* ocean,... do not, with your troopshaving encountered
Salya*sink in a cow-track" (gospadam*; 36). Such contradictions point to an ambiguity in Salya's* character and
also dignify him as a worthy opponent for Yudhisthira*, who has never showed himself to be the greatest of
fighters. Second, and more important, it is Krishna who puts Yudhisthira* to the task that Ruben would have him
do entirely on his own: "I do not find a well-matched opponent [pratiyoddharam*] for him [Salya*] in battle
except you, O tiger among men, of prowess equal to a tiger's; in the heavenly world and in this entire world, there
is no man other than you who would be able to slay the angered king of the Madras" (30-31).
In what sense is Salya* such a "well-matched opponent" (pratiyoddhr*) ? One does well to note that in a list
where suitable "shares" (bhaga*) are delegated to the Pandava* warriors, only in Yudhisthira's* case is some
qualification expressed: "The share of Pandu's* eldest son will be the mighty king of the Madras, although some
tell us that these two are considered uneven" (visamau*; 5:56,13). The matter of their being "well-matched" yet
"uneven" is unresolved, but Yudhisthira* seems to have regarded Krishna's words as being very weighty. When
Salya* at first gets the best of the fighting, Yudhisthira* asks: "How, verily, can these important words [vaco
mahat] of Madhava's* become true" (9:12,35)? When he finally decides he must take matters into his own hands
as Krishna had prompted, his reflections translate pratiyoddhr* into the very suggestive term bhãga, "share," which
occurred in the passage concerning the appointments of personal opponents. Speaking to his brothers and Krishna,
Yudhisthira* says: "Bhisma*, Drona*, Karna* and the other rulers of the earth who were energetic for the sake of
the Kauravas have all gone to their

death in battle. Each according to his share, each according to his strength [yathabhagam * yathotsaham*], you
have fought in manly fashion. One share remains. This is mine: the great chariot-warrior Salya*" (bhago* 'vasista*
eko 'yam* mama salyo* maharathah*; 9:15,16-17). We have already anticipated what this "share" consists of in
the present context.46 As the two kings fight, other warriors, watching the progress of their fight, could not tell
"whether the son of Prtha*, having slain the king of Madra, would enjoy the earth [vasumdharam*], or whether
Salya*, having slain the son of Pandu*, would give the earth [dadyat*... gam*] to Duryodhana" (15,58-59).
Yudhisthira's* "share," in the person of Salya*, will be the earth.
The combat takes place in two stages, the end of the first marked by the fall of Salya's* "furrowed" banner (15,64).
Then, after Salya* recovers the initiative for awhile, Yudhisthira* recalls Krishna's words: "And, having reflected
that his share was still remaining [bhagamathavasistam* smrtva*], his mind was firmly set on the death of Salya*
as had been counseled by the younger brother of Indra [Krishna]" (16,37). At this point, Yudhisthira* takes up the
special dart (sakti*) he had just called to mind47 and slays Salya* with it. In describing the latter's fall the poets
have given their most careful attention to the themes under discussion. The notion of "shares," for instance, is
probably bound up with the double insistence that Yudhisthira* is performing a sort of sacrifice in which Salya* is
likened to the fire which at first blazes up (16,48) and is then extinguished (55). Most revealing is the resonant
description of the end of King Salya's* affair with the earth:
Having spread his arms, he fell from his chariot to the earth [gam*] with his armor cut away .... Having
spread his arms, facing toward

47 It is given a long description (16,38-47): created by Tvastr* for Siva*, it had been long worshiped by the
Pandavas* (43-44). In connection with Salya*, the only point of interest is that it was "unerringly fatal to
haters of brahmins" (45), a theme I will discuss below.

the Dharmaraja *, the king of Madra fell on the earth [bhumau*] like a tall Indra-banner. Then, all his
mangled limbs bathed in blood, it was as if that bull among men was risen up to be the earth, out of love
[pratyudgata iva premna* bhumya*].48 A lover to his dear beloved, as if fallen on her breast [priyaya*
kantaya* kantah* patamana* ivorasi], that lord, having for a long time enjoyed the earth [vasumatim*] like
a dear loved one [priyam* kantamiva*], clinging to her with all his limbs, was like one who was sleeping
[sarvairangaih* samaslisya* prasupta iva so 'bhavat]. [16,49-54]
The position, as another passage tells, betokens the fall of a king. In Krishna's words: "The lords of the earth, slain
for the earth's sake, having embraced the earth with their limbs like a dear beloved, are sleeping" (prthivyam*
prthivihetoh* prthivipatayo* hatah* / prthivimupaguhyangaih* suptah* kantamiva* priyam*; Dronaparvan*, App.
I, No. 17, 11. 14-15).
It is by now evident that this figure who has been tricked by his taste for luxury into taking Duryodhana's side,49
whose death has deprived Duryodhana of his sri*, and whose body finally mingles with the earth, is consistently
evoking themes of the third function. The terms used for the earth in her relationship to Salya* seem, to a marked
degree, ones which emphasize such symbolism. Earth is the "cow" (go; 9:15,59; 16,49-51: "the earth [as the milk-
cow of kings]," Monier-Williams)a term that gives depth to Krishna's counsel not to "sink, having encountered
Salya*, in a cow-track" (gospadam*).50 Earth is Vasumdhara*, the "bearer of riches" (9:15,58), and Vasumati*,
"the possessor of riches" (16,54). Or, when Salya* moves his troops, it is as Medini*, "she having fatness," that the
earth "seems to tremble" (5:8,5). These are not exceptional terms for the earth, but they underline the relationship
between the earth and the king in the direction of third-function themes. The embrace with the earth at Salya's*
death even calls to mind aspects of the mythology of Sri-Laksmi*. As he lies clasping

his beloved earth with outstretched arms,51 the last words to describe him strike a deep chord: "His heart split by
that dart and his standard and weapons scattered, even altogether stilled [samsantam *], laksmi* did not desert the
lord of the Madras" (madresam* laksmirnaiva* vyamuñcata; 16,56). I would prefer not to translate laksmi* here,
for, although the meanings "beauty" (Ganguli-Roy)52 or "fortune" are no doubt involved, the associations of
royalty with Sri-Laksmi* give the passage a depth that should not be lost.
At this point, one may ask: what has all this to do with sins? In fact, at least on the surface, and as Ruben saw so
clearly, Yudhisthira*fighting "singly" (eko; 15,50) and "in righteous combat"does not sin in slaying Salya*.
Though one might certainly raise eyebrows at his behavior (and probably Krishna's complicity) in claiming as his
"share" the foe with whom he had laid the secret scheme to slay Karna*, any suspicions that he is wiping out the
evidence are apparently unfounded: the Mahabharata*, remarkably, never raises the possibility. Moreover, the
poets take great pains to give an official respectability to Yudhisthira's* triumph. In the passage describing Salya's*
death embrace, it is said that he lay "slain by Dharma's son of righteous soul in righteous combat" (dharmye
dharmatmana* yuddhe nihato dharmasununa*; 16,55). Yet one cannot help but ask, what with all these puns and
this highly stylized claim to virtue, whether the poets speak with true praise or heavy irony.
In any case, Yudhisthira* is not the only sovereign to have questionable dealings with his foes. In the last chapter I
discussed the Mahabharata's* (indeed, Salya's*) reorientation of the mythology of the sins of Indra. There we saw
how the epic accounts are close in basic outline to myths from the Brahmanas* in their treatment of Indra's first
two sins, against Visvarupa* and Vrtra*, and how the epic accounts differ from a later, more "artificial,"
Markandeya* Purana* myth in their handling of the third-function sequel to these sins. First, the Mahabharata*
has

Indra commit no third-function sin like the violation of Ahalya *; rather, he is sinned against in the same fashion,
by Nahusa* who covets his wife. Second, this third episode is the only one in which Indra is challenged by a
human king. These differences in the epic's myth, or myths, help to give us an account, not of the annihilation of
the warrior god through three sins, but of the restoration of the not-so-perfect divine sovereign to his throne. On
the level of heroic action, the epic story is oriented in the same direction, and it seems that the epic poets have
worked, or perhaps reworked, mythic and epic material into recognizably complementary patterns.
Salya*, as indicated, is the beloved of the earth, and we have so far seen little indication that he may have violated
her, "Yudhisthira's* earth," in any way that might run parallel to Nahusa's* ill intent toward Saci*. Admittedly, no
strict parallel will be found. But when one examines the mythic and epic scenes within the context of the third
function, their divergent plots will show their reliance on a common store of themes and symbols. We have already
noticed a certain ambiguity in Salya's* character. Not surprisingly, it is bound up with his relationship to the earth.
For its most complete expression, we must turn back to the "insult exchange" between Salya* and Karna*.
In Karna's* tirade Salya* is frequently the recipient of epithets like papadesaja*, "born in a sinful country." Karna*
charges the people of Salya's* land not only with the subversion of friendship, but, in two very long speeches
(8:27,71-91 and 30,9-82), with a whole host of sins. It would be fruitless to file all the charges, but their central
thrust is illuminating.
In the first denunciation, friendship is related to the question of purity and in one phrase (which, though widely
found, is not in the Critical Edition), Karna* depicts the Madraka as "always dirt" (sada* malah*).53 But if the
first speech does not generalize on the alleged Madraka character to any great

extent, the sins it records are all breaches of the orthopraxy demanded by brahminical society. People of all ages
and sexes mingle freely (27,75-76), impure food and incoherent speech are common (77-78), and, most
notoriously, Madraka women (76 and 85-90) are wanton, drunk, mercenary, "pass urine like camels and asses"
(86), and are "very shameless, hairy, gluttonous, and impure" (asaucas *; 89). These, says Karna*, are mleccha
(barbaric) traits and practices (91); and especially as they concern women, they are tied in most intimately with
Salya's* birth: "Being the son of one of these, how can a Madraka speak of dharma" (85)?
Looking outside the insult exchange, some corroboration for these charges can no doubt be found in Madraka
"family practice" (kuladharma) which Salya* upholds in marrying his sister Madri* to Pandu* by selling her.
Dumézil, in calling attention to this "matrimonial practice 'unworthy' of ksatriyas*, reserved for vaisyas*," argues
that these traits bear further relation to the quasi-vaisya* character of Nakula and Sahadeva, Madri's* sons.54
Karna's* first speech, however, is only a sort of warm-up. There is no clear formulation of what underlies the
adharma and asauca* ("impurity") of the Madraka. His second speech is more helpful.
At the outset, Karna* bases his remarksaccording to the authority of a brahmin (8:30, 8-9)upon certain
geographical considerations: "Those who are situated away from the Himavat and apart from the Ganga*,
Sarasvati*, Yamuna*, and also Kuruksetra*; who are dwellers in the region of the five rivers with the Sindhu as
the sixthone should avoid these Bahlikas* who are impure [asucin*] and beyond the pale of dharma"
(dharmabahyan*; 8:30, 10-11). There have been various efforts to determine who the Bahlikas* (apparent variant
Bahikas*) are and what their relationship is with the

Madrakas,55 but they are regarded here as Salya's * subjects. This geographical partitioning of the pure and the
impure is reinforced several times, but nowhere more forcefully than in the notion that the inhabitants of Bahlika*
country do not descend from the original creation:
Where the five rivers flow, having just issued from the mountain, among those named Arattas* and
Bahlikas* a respectable person [arya*] should not dwell for even two days. Two Pisacas* named Bahis
["Outsider"] and Hlika* ["Ashamed"?] live on the Vipasa* [one of the five rivers]. The offspring of these
two are the Bahlikas*; this creation is not Prajapati's* [bahisca* nama* hlikasca* vipasayam* pisacakau* /
tayorapatyam* bahlika* naisa* srstih* prajapateh*]. [30,43-44]56
Such a notion of impurity as that which stands outside the categories of the divine creation certainly sits well with
Mary Douglas' celebrated analysis of the impure in the Old Testament.57
If the impure is, in the general sense, that which is outside the ordered arya world, Karna's* further specifications
of the
55 See Vaidya, ed., Karnaparvan*, "Critical Notes," p. 686: "Bahlika* country did not form part of
Aryavarta*" and probably consisted of Madra and Pañcanada. He cites (p. 85) J. M. Chatterji, "Ahura-
Mazda in the Mahabharata*," Iran League Quarterly, XIX (1948-1949), 50, who takes Madra as Media
and Salya* as a Persian king who performed his own sacrifices, Madrakas being called rajayajakah*,
"those whose sacrificers are kings" (8:27,81; 30,70). A.D. Pusalker, The History and Culture of the Indian
People, I: The Vedic Age, A. K. Majumdar, ed. (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1951), 263, doubts that
Bahlika*, "Outsider," implies Iranian. Most implausible, Robert Shafer, Ethnography of Ancient India
(Weisbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1954), p. 141, links Bahlikas* with Harappa*. See also M-W, s.v.

etymology .... So the Bahlikas* are a Pisaca* race, and not an Aryan* race, which alone is propagated by
Prajapati*, the Creator." Shafer, Ethnography of Ancient India, p. 141, says: "I interpret this as meaning that
they were the offspring of two devils." Bahis' sex cannot be determined.
57 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo (New York: Praeger,
1966), pp. 41-57, shows that what is consistently impure about the abominations of Leviticus is that they do
not fit the divinely ordered "holy" categories of Genesis.

pure are equally interesting: "Among the Matsyas and those of the Kuru-Pancala * countries, among the
Naimisas*, the Cedis, and others who are distinguished [visistah*], the good [santah*] uphold the ancient dharma;
but not the Madras and the crooked people of the five rivers" (30,62-63). These verses would seem to recall the
sacred geography, cited above, of the Ganga*, Yamuna*, Sarasvati*, and Kuruksetra* areas. They also suggest,
first, that excepting the "Naimisas*" who do not form one of the combatant kingdoms in the epic (elsewhere
Naimisa* is a forest), these "distinguished" and "good" peoplesthe Matsyas, Cedis, and Pancalas*form the very
core of the Pandava* army. Second, the region which they broadly represent seems to evoke the idea of a "sacred
center," one reminiscent of the central region, madhyadesa*, which, near the beginning of the Lunar Dynasty and
long before Kuru, Yayati* gave to his youngest son Puru*, leaving the "outlying regions" to his four older sons
(1:82,5).58 Such a geography is in fact confirmed, despite the different interpretation, by Robert Shafer's study of
the distribution of the epic's peoples.59 One thus perceives that the symbolic geography of the battle of
Kuruksetra* represents a defense and a regeneration of the Center of the Earth by a reassertion of its purity, and its
peoples' relative purity, over and against the periphery. This is not the only instance concerning the Pandavas*
where the purity of the Center comes into question. When Yudhisthira* asks Krishna whether to perform a

consecrates Puru's* descendants "the one horn [visanabhutam*] of the entire wide earth" (van Buitenen,
The Mahabarata*: I, 212, with n. 35, p. 455).
59 See Shafer, Ethnography of Ancient India, p. 48: "The Ayran strength was along the Yamuna* and upper
Ganges. The Pandavas* received very little aid from the Indo-Aryans of the northwest"; supporting this, see
Shafer's "map 2" (back of book), which he says makes clear "the concentration of Pandava* forces about the
central Ganges-Yamuna* doab." Shafer's theory of a "great rebellion" is less reliable than his geographical
reconstructions, which themselves must often be viewed cautiously.

(2:13,4-6), says that before Yudhisthira * can assert his sovereignty, he must rid himself of Jarasamdha*a figure
also much bound up with symbolisms of impurity and adharma60who has established himself in "middle earth"
(avanim* madhyamam*; 13,7). But the symbolism of a great battle in which the center reasserts itself against the
periphery also joins the growing list of Mahabharata* themes which find striking parallels in Saxo Grammaticus'
account of the Battle of Brávellir.61 For in that battle too, as Saxo describes it, the ordered array of "firm and
stout" Swedish and Norwegian soldiery led by the princes Ringo (in charge of the land forces) and Olo (in charge
of the fleet) faces an army of "unmanly peoples," a mass of fickle offscourings," arrayed in support of their blind
old uncle Haraldus Hyldetan and the Danes.62
Salya*, then, is the king of a people who, at least for Karna*, come from the impurest of all the decentralized
lands; and as their king, according to a familiar notion, he is "the bearer of a one-sixth share of their merits and
misdeeds" (9:30,63; cf. 30,27). Moreover, despite his lifelong love affair with the earth, he is named in one of the
"dictionaries of incarnations" (1:61) as one of those Asuras, born into royal lineages, whom the earth had called
upon the gods to overthrow.63 This is the underside of his ambiguous character and of the ambiguities in the
symbolism of the outlying kingdoms which he represents. Not only are such lands potential suppliers of wives,
troops, and tribute to the rulers of the "central kingdom"; such contacts with the central realm are among the
factors that involve the

latter, and thus the whole earth, in the greatest menace imaginable: what the Gita * calls "a languishing of dharma"
(dharmasya glanir*; 4,7; cf. 1,40-43), as well as what Karn*. a is calling the danger of impurity.
In this connection Karna* evokes the "master symbol" for Salya* and his peoples, that of dirt, malam. To
appreciate its aptness, however, requires that we recall the source of an earlier observation. As Mary Douglas says,
quoting William James, dirt is "matter out of place."64 Outside madhyadesa*, outside even the Creation, ruled by
an incarnated Asura, the Madras* and Bahlikas* are "people out of place" and dirt is their "natural" symbol. Not a
great number of verses are devoted to this subject, but the key passages pile up toward the end of Karna's* tirade as
if in summation: "Begging is a ksatriya's* dirt, untruth is a brahmin's dirt, Bahlikas* are the dirt of the earth
[malam* prthivya* bahlikah*], Madra women are the dirt of women" (strinam* madrastriyo malam; 30,68). And
again: "Mlecchas are the dirt of mankind [manusanam* malam* mleccha*]; rogues [maustikah*] are the dirt of
mlecchas; eunuchs [sandah*] are the dirt of rogues; those whose sacrificial priests are warriors65 are the dirt of
eunuchs; and whatever dirt there is of Madrakas whose sacrificial priests are warriors, that dirt shall be yours if you
do not release me" (30,70-71).66 Finally, there is a sloka* found throughout the Northern recension but not in the
Southern which the Critical Edition naturally rejects. Nonetheless, it sums things up neatly: "On earth the Madraka
is called the dirt of every region; and so too the Madra woman is called the dirt of all women" (prthivyam*

66 Karna* quotes a Raksasa* for these two proverbs (gathas*) which are clearer than the story that connects
them. The Raksasa* seems to have plunged into the water to purify himself of Madraka defilement and has
warned some unnamed king to unhand him lest he be polluted too. It is added that the Raksasas*' words can be
used as a "curative charm" (bhesajam*; 72)

malamucyate / tatha * strinam* ca sarvasam* madrika* mala ucyate; 397* and 398*, after 30,81).
How are we to understand this association, this symbol for the darker side of Salya's* character? The passages
themselves give the clue: "the Bahlika* is the dirt of the earth"; "on earth the Madraka is called the dirt of every
nation." Dirt falls within the context of the symbolism of the earth; it is earth's unregenerate side, her "matter out of
place." In the concluding chapter of Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas offers a key with which to interpret this
correlation within the larger context of the subject of Part Four: eschatology. Against the background of the epic's
symbolic geography, which places the Madras, Bahlikas*, and other Kaurava allies on the "outside" while the
Pandavas*' defense of the center becomes a climactic regeneration of sauca* and dharma, Douglas' hermeneutic of
dirt as undifferentiated formlessness is most revealing:
In this final stage of total disintegration, dirt is utterly undifferentiated. Thus a cycle has been completed.
Dirt was created by the differentiating activity of mind, it was a by-product of the creation of order. So it
started from a state of non-differentiation; all through the process of differentiating its role was to threaten
the distinctions made; finally it returns to its true indiscriminate character. Formlessness is therefore an apt
symbol of beginning and growth as it is of decay.67
In the Mahabharata*, such a cycle has been completed: the cataclysm of battle has dissolved the impure world not
into the primeval ocean, as will occur at the end of the kalpa, but, appropriately for the end of a yuga, into the
earth.68 Numerous are the descriptions of the earth, in the midst of battle, covered with rivers of gore bearing the
dead to her own infernal

be criticized for making a facile equation; see Purity and Danger, p. 161.

regions.69 Through this battle, the earth is relieved of her burden. When she rises up to clasp Salya * to her, it is
the culminating scene not only of a love affair, but of a regeneration. In this moment impurity and purity, dirt and
soil, earth's kings and earth herself, are one. Through his victory over Salya*, the earth is now Yudhisthira's*
"share," given, even if only for a moment, anew.
Returning now to the Mahabharata's* myth of the sins and restoration of Indra, there are features that comprise its
final episodethe conflict with Nahusa*that are analogous to this final episode of the Kuruksetra* war.70 Like Indra,
Yudhisthira* does not sin; rather, the adversaries of both commit sins within the area of the third function. More
specifically, each has his mind turned by sense enjoyments and wealth, and each, in one way or another, sins by
"despising Indra."71 Their opponents' sins help give both Indra's and Yudhisthira's* triumphs a look of
comparative righteousness. For not only does Nahusa* covet Indra's wife and Salya* "defile" Yudhisthira's* earth;
not only is each associated with a third-function sin; but each is charged additionally with a total violation of
dharma: Salya* reaping the sins of his subjects, Nahusa* offending the brahmin Agastya by touching his foot to his
head. Finally, both the epic and mythic episodes hinge upon the opponent being a human king. This last point,
however, calls for further examination, which I turn to now, of the four episodes discussed above and the
underlying themes which link them together.
The Four Marshals and the Symbolism of Sovereignty
Concerning the nature of the sins committed in the slayings of the four marshals, I have shown that the four
episodes form a cohesively structured group. Not only do the slain give their
69 See, for example, 6:66, 12; 7:13,9-18; 7,68,47-54; 8:33,45-70; 8:36; sometimes the blood and gore lend
the earth an eerie beauty, as in 6:53,21-22.
70 After this, the Kuru forces, without a marshal, are scattered.

names to the four battle parvans; not only do Yudhisthira * and Krishna figure prominently at the deepest level of
each misdeed; but the episodes refer to, recall, and reinforce each other at a number of levels.
To interpret their coherence, let us first turn to the moral dimension. As was argued earlier, sins and virtues can
best be seen as complementary to each other. The shifting assortments of trifunctional royal virtues, such as were
discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, show a significant correlation with the sins committed, or engaged in, by
Yudhisthira*. On the first level, it will be recalled that tejas, an ancient first-function virtue, is often replaced by
the pair satya and dharma, and, moreover, that vrata, the "vow," where it occurs, seems to function as a
specialization of dharma.72 As we have seen, Yudhisthira's* first two sins are violations of the vow and of truth.
On the second level, the traditional virtues were seen to be such qualities as yasas*, "fame," balam, "strength," and
viryam*, "courage." But we also observed that some lists focus on the quality of honorable relations with other
ksatriyas*.73 Yudhisthira*, at this level, is at the root of a complicated violation of friendship. Finally, on the third
level, the most frequent virtues were sri*, "prosperity," and danam*, "generosity." As we have seen, on this level
the sin, or sins, is not Yudhisthira's* but Salya's*, consisting, in general, of a violation or despoliation of the earth,
and, in particular, of an oversensitivity to wealth, gifts, and sense enjoyments.
Thus, through the deaths of the four marshals, the epic illustrates a theme of moral decline and restoration within
the framework of the three functions. Still within the moral dimension, however, another connecting link between
the four episodes has been mentioned. Salya*, like Nahusa*, is a human king and, moreover, the only senapati*
who is a complete and legitimate king. Each of the others is what may be called an

incomplete or illegitimate raja *. Bhisma*, a potential king, would have ruled the Kurus were it not for his
vows.74 After Drona's* fateful battle with the Pancala* king Drupada, he becomes the ruler of half that kingdom
even though he is a brahmin (1:128, 14-18). And Karna*, like Bhisma* a potential king of the Kurus, is also,
thanks to his friendship with Duryodhana, made king of Anga*, despite his status, in everyone's eyes, as the son of
a suta*, a mixed-caste charioteer (1:126,35-36).75 In contrast with such flirtations with kingship, Salya* is the
only one born and consecrated a king within a "legitimate" line of succession. Like Nahusa*, the last opponent of
Indra, Salya* is a king by descent; but neither is a legitimate challenger for the "stake" or "share" which his
opponent seeks: the sovereignty of "middle earth," or the sovereignty of heaven.
Further in this direction, a third factor linking the four marshals is closely related to their royal or quasi-royal
identities. Each of them is, in one way or another, of confused caste status. Bhisma*, though a ksatriya*, is a
lifelong brahmacarin.*76 Drona* , though a brahmin, is a foremost weapons expert. Karna*, though a ksatriya* by
birth, is a mixed-caste suta* by upbringing and by reputation. And Salya*, though a ksatriya*, is a "vaisya*" (or
even a mleccha) in his behavior and is said to perform his own sacrifices. Confusion of caste is, of course, one of
the great horrors of the epic, of the Gita* no less than of its "caricature," the insult exchange between Karna* and
Salya*.77 These indeterminate identifications appear to be either at, or very near, the root of the circumstances
which bring each of
74 See above, n. 4; Bhisma* is sometimes called "king," even "best of kings" (rajasattama*; 12:54,15) by
Krishna! In heaven (18:4,17) he is bhismam* ... nrpam, the "kingly Bhisma*."
75 See Chapter 8, at nn. 14 and 60; on the implausibility of Drona* and Karna* as actual kings, van Buitenen,
The Mahabharata*: I, 12, points up the need to explain the symbolic character of these titles.
76 This does not necessarily imply brahmin caste status, but as a lifelong commitment it does involve the
neglect of numerous ksatriya* duties.

the marshals to his final fall. This is explicit in Drona's * case, for, when he continues to fight after he has heard
the lie, the Rsis* tell him that he is "fighting unrighteously, ... especially being a brahmin" (7:164,89-92). But it is
also true that if Bhisma* falls because of the complicated fabric of his "terrible" vows, it is the brahmacarya vow
which holds this fabric together. Karna's* mixed status encourages the Pandavas*' and Draupadi's* contempt for
him (a contempt nutured by Krishna) and sustains his own tragic resentment which leads inevitably to his death.
Salya*, according to Karna*, is a "mean-minded low defiler of the ksatriya* class" (8:27,68) who dies having
made one "ksatriya*" agreement to violate another.
In sum, from the Pandavas*' perspective, there is a kind of moral justification for killing these flawed foes. Each
violates the ordered hierarchy of caste. Thus each is guilty, albeit in the first three cases as an unwilling victim of
fate, of endangering the fabric of dharma. Logically, their chief antagonist is Yudhisthira*, the Dharmaraja*, who
emerges as a true champion of dharma, one who, out of necessity, has faced its intricacies and burdens so as to
preserve its essence. For it is Yudhisthira's* royal dharma that he must seek to rule; and the intricacies result from
it being a time for apaddharma*, for practices allowable in times of distress. He has, in other words, violated
dharma, or at least sustained it in a precarious balance, in order finally to uphold it. The key to this whole matter is
the "righteous combat" (9:16,65) in which Yudhisthira* slays Salya*. No doubt the words are two-edged, but on
the just side Yudhisthira* is the righteous victor over the most impure and adharmic of all his foes. Indeed, with
his triumph, and with the triumph of the Pandavas* in general, despite his violation of first- and second-function
virtues, the rehabilitation is one of the structure of the three functions itself, over and against the forces of
impurity, adharma, disorder, chaos.78
78 On this point, cf. Biardeau, EMH, 2, Appendice, p. 104: "The unstructured group of the Kauravas
symbolizes the society that is disorderly and literally sunk into chaos: their victory would signify the earth's
return

The four marshals reflect upon each other in their symbolism on two more levels. And here we begin to move away
from the dharmic and societal considerations to cosmological ones. In Chapter 2, we observed at one point that a
special color symbolism applies to the four varnas * and the four yugas: the sequence white, red, yellow, and
black.79 The same colors seem to have been held consistently in mind regarding the four marshals.
The most obvious color associations are those of Bhisma*. Just before the Kuruksetra* war, before the Gita*, we
see him thus: "The aged Bhisma* was in the van of the entire army, having a white umbrella, white bow and
conch, white headgear, with a white banner, white horses, having the appearance of a white mountain" (6:20,9).80
Right after this Drona* is described as having red steeds (sonairhayaih*; 6:20, 11 ), elsewhere "great red steeds"
(sona* brhanto* 'svah*; 7:8, 15; cf. 7:7,10). Karna* is usually thought of with his natural-born golden mail and
earrings (3:292,5) like those of his father Surya* (3:290,5), but the epic draws no sharp distinction between gold
and yellow: when Kunti* invokes Surya* to father Karna*, the god appears before her "yellow as honey"
(madhupinga*; 3:290,8). Although Salya* draws no color descriptions, his connection is with the "black" earth81
and with dirt.
If one cannot be certain whether to relate this "descent by color" to the structures of society (the varnas*) or to
those of time (the yugas), there can be little doubt that the four marshals articulate an elaborate spatial symbolism.

79 See above, Chapter 2, following n. 10.
80See also 5:179, 10-14, mentioning six white articles which Bhisma* wears in his fight with Parasurama*;
also 6:16,40; however, Drona* also wears white, as in 1:24,17-18. Several manuscripts, mostly from the North
but one from the Southern recension, describe a very long battle between Bhisma* and a son of Virata* named
Sveta*, "White" (Bhismaparvan*, Appendix I, No. 4); no doubt the colors are significant in this duel, making
"Sveta*" one of Bhisma's* "shares.'

when Salya * fell, "it was as if the earth, out of love, rose to meet him," it suddenly becomes clear that in each of
the other episodes, indeed at their very conclusions, the earth has likewise undergone a dramatic change in position
vis-à-vis the heroes. The Bhismaparvan* ends with Bhisms*, on his bed of arrows, not touching the earth at all
(dharanim* nasprsat*; 6:114,84)as if his character had remained "elevated," like that of his foes, especially Arjuna
who (recalling Indra?) brings forth fresh pure water from the earth herself with one of his arrows so that Bhisma*
may wash his wounds and slake his thirst (6:116,19-23).82 The Dronaparvan* then provides the point where this
elevated position is lost, where the hero comes down to earth: when Yudhisthira* lies, his chariot, until then
provided with an air cushion of four fingers, "touched the earth" (vahasprsanmahim*; 7: 164, 107). Next, the
Karnaparvan* shows the earth taking the initiative, but with the heroes still on the descendent. In a passage in
which Dumézil has found an important transposition from the Rg* Veda,83 the earth "swallows" Karna's* chariot
wheel (agrasanmahi* cakram; 8:66,59), leading to his defeat. Thus when the earth rises, as it were, to clasp Salya*
to her, it is the culmination of a four-act drama.
One may thus find a sympathetic connection between the earth and the fall of the heroes. Yet the meaning of this
four-part progression becomes clear only when it is seen against another spatial dimension. Not only are the four
marshals a ladder of descent to the earth; they also seem to symbolize an ascent, or an access, to the "three
worlds."84 The final destinies of

one of the wheels of the Sun god's chariot; see especially RV* 4:28,2: he "pressed the wheel downward" (see
above, Chapter 1, n. 28).
84 It may also be significant that the four marshals approximate a four-directional location: Karna's* Anga* is
east of Hastinapura*, Drona's* Ahicchatra* is south (or southeast), Salya's* Madra is west (or northwest),

Bhisma * and Drona*, after their deaths, are in the heavens: Bhisma* returning as the Vasu Dyaus ("Heaven")85 to
the invisible heaven of the Vasus (13:153,44; cf. 154,5-7), Drona* ascending to Brahmaloka (7:165,41). In
contrast, Karna's* destiny is to have his tejas re-enter the sun (8:67,27), which in the epic would seem to connote a
residence in a lower realm.86 And, once again, Salya's* fate is to be embraced by the earth.87 In other words, their
essences conform to the three levels of the universe, or perhaps to a fourth if Brahmaloka refers to an absolute
realm. This is the universe Yudhisthira* has conquered, the last world of whichthe earthis not only the final stake
of battle but an active agent in the victory she had sought. In this respect, it is interesting that in Brahmana* texts,
the earth, known as the ksatriya's* loka (SB* 11, 8,4,5; 12,8,3,5), is said to be the "most essential" (rasatarna) of
the worlds (SB* 9,1,2,36)88 and the "foundation" (pratistha*; SB* 6,1,1,15; 6,7,3,4) from which to obtain the
other worlds.89 Indeed, as the heroes are drawn closer to the earth through sins (beginning with Yudhisthira's* lie),
the earth rises to meet them, finally claiming

Salya *, the most "dirt"-ridden of all, as her own. And in the process, with Yudhisthira* as her champion in the
"righteous battle" with Salya*, the earth becomes a "firm support" for the "sovereignty of the triple world" which
Yudhisthira* had always "deserved"90 and has now finally obtained.
The aggregate of the four marshals, and the four parvans bearing their names, thus present a complex ethical-
societal time-space symbol. At the battle of Kuruksetra*, the structures of time'and space are condensed. In terms
of time, all the epic's events occur at the end of a yuga (yuganta*), a sort of "liminal" period in which these four
figures and their parvans (literally "knots, joints"91 seem to represent the sum of the yugas, as if all four yugas
were potentially present at the point of transition. In terms of space, representatives of all the lands of the known
world are present within the land of the "Center," where the deaths of their rulersin particular that of
Salya*symbolize the attainment by Yudhisthira* of his "share," the earth, as a firm "support" for the establishment
of his triple-world sovereignty, and the base for his ultimate attainment of heaven.

Chapter 11
Absolutions
The conquest of the three worlds is a perennial Indian symbol. Gonda links the theme most closely with the
"soteriological theories" of the period of the Brahmanas.1 According to Satapatha * Brahmana* 12,8,2,32, "one
might secure these three worlds by three victims."2 Although the point will be discussed in Chapter 13, for the
moment one may say that even in the Brahmanas*, the taking of animal victims (pasu*) involves impurities and
dangers which must be neutralized.3 It is no different in the epic. The acquisition, or recovery, of the three worlds
is achieved by triumphing over human victims, "shares," in a great "sacrifice of battle," where there are
mechanisms to neutralize, or absolve, the sins which have been committed to attain sovereignty by means of such
an uncompromising "ritual."
On this last point we return to Krishna. We saw in Chapter 6 how, before the war begins, Krishna provides a
justification for itindeed a "just base" for conquest within the Kuru landsby going to Hastinapura*. Now, within the
war, he takes part in a series of episodes that from a certain standpoint are sins.
The first problem is to differentiate between "viewpoints" on this matter, and the best initial guideline is provided
by the

insight of Walter Ruben that Krishna's involvements are not sins because, in conformity with his own ethics of the
Gita *, he acts not for his own ends, but for those of others.4 This does not mean that Krishna is beyond reproach.
When Duryodhana falls, delivered a foul blow by Bhima's* mace which he knows was prompted by Krishna, he
blames Krishna for the deaths of Bhisma*, Drona*, Karna*, and Bhurisravas* (9:60,30-34), the latter seemingly a
royal stand-in for the "righteously slain" Salya*.5 And when Gandhari* sees her hundred sons slain on the
battlefield, she charges Krishna with "overlooking" (upa-iks-*; 11:25,36,38 and 40)6 the destruction while being
able to prevent it. But these insights are drawn from personal passions and attachments. There is no doubt that they
capture the surface events and produce charges that any "secular" judge would honor in the courtroom. But they do
not capture the essential. Indeed, there is some irony in the charge that Krishna "overlooks" or "is indifferent to"
the heroes' fates. One thinks of his advice to Arjuna to cultivate "indifference" (samyam, samatvam; Gita* 5, 18-
19; 2,48; 4,22, etc.).
Ruben, however, takes us only this far, for Krishna's "innocence" does not automatically exculpate those whom he
counsels. Yudhisthira* in particular, contrary to Arjuna, falls outside the umbrella of the Gita*. As we saw in
Chapter 9, his own mea culpa stresses over and over that he has sinned out of the desire (lubdha) for short-lived
sovereignty. Indeed, his sins have such impact that they affect his brothers: when he lies to Drona*, Arjuna sees
this "great injustice" as the "disfigurement" (vikara*) of the remainder of their lives.7
But although Krishna is undoubtedly involved, the sins do not really affect him, unless it be with what the epic
calls "shame" or "embarrassment." In the scene just mentioned

in which Duryodhana blames Krishna for the deaths of his major warriors, Duryodhana continues, after Krishna
denounces him in turn, with a recitation of his own virtues. It is roughly trifunctional and reminiscent, in structure,
of another bit of boastful self-praise by Yayati *.8 Following each citation with the formulaic question: "Who is
there having a better end than myself," Duryodhana marks off three areas of self-fulfillment:
[By] study [adhitim*], [by] donation according to prescription [vidhivaddattam], I have been ruler
[prasasta*] of the earth with her seas ....9
What is sought by members of the ksatriya* class reflecting on their svadharma, that end [nidhanam; death
in battle]10 is obtained ....
Human shares [manusa bhagah*] worthy of the gods, difficult for kings to obtain, were obtained.11 [60,47-
49]
These three areas of achievement, he says, have won him heaven, and his words are given sanction by a shower of
heavenly flowers falling to melodies of the Gandharvas, Apsarases, and Siddhas (60,51-53). Momentarily, victory
has turned to defeat, defeat to victory. Seeing this puja* of Duryodhana and "hearing that Bhisma*, Drona*, as
well as Karna* and Bhurisravas* were slain unrighteously" (adharmatah*), the Pandavas*, "headed by
Vasudeva*" (vasudevapurogamah*), became ashamed (vridamupagaman*; 60,54-55).
At this low point, the true end of the battle, Krishna begins to set things right. Before the battle, he had established
the conditions for a dharmic victory by Yudhisthira* and a yogic battle performance by Arjuna. Within the battle,
while remaining "indifferent, .... aloof," he guided these two and
81:88,21-24; see above, Chapter 8, at n. 28.
9The first two achievements have to do with following specifically religious injunctions and the last with
sovereigntyall connected with the first function.
10 This is the interpretation, surely correct, in Ganguli-Roy, Mahabharata, VII: Salya Parva, 181.
11 These shares presumably refer to Duryodhana's material position, his wealth, prosperity.

their brothers to a victory which nonetheless left them flawed and ashamed. Now, from two of the "three Krsna's"
*"Vasudeva* and Vyasa*we learn why these sins were necessary and how they can be absolved. In general, this
may be called the "restorative" or "reconstructive" phase, carried out, as Biardeau has enabled us to anticipate, by
the two incarnations of Visnu-Narayana*.
First, with regard to the necessity of the sins, there is the justification by divine precedent, so contemptuously
discounted as "late" by the younger Adolf Holtzmann.12 On the contrary, however, parallels drawn between
mythic scenarios and epic events are often invaluable guidelines for cross-interpretation. In the present scene, after
Krishna and the Pandavas*' shame at the cosmic approval of Duryodhana, Krishna sets himself the task of restoring
the good cheer of victory. First he admits that such formidable foes as Duryodhana has cited could not have been
slain "in fair fight" (rjuyuddhena*); "therefore these stratagems were contrived by me" (upaya* vihita* hyete
maya*; 60,57). Then, in reply to Duryodhana's specific charges, he says: "Surely these four were all highsouled
and first-rate chariot warriors on earth; they could not have been slain righteously [dharmatas] even by the
Lokapalas* themselves" (59). So far, in substantiating the superiority of the foe and admitting his own part in three
of the four episodes analyzed in the last chapter, Krishna would seem to have provided only further cause for
humiliation. But now comes the justification: "Enemies of superior number are to be slain falsely [mithyavadhas*],
as also by stratagems [upayair*]. This path [marga*] was formerly followed when the gods were slayers of the
Asuras. A path followed by the good [sadbhis] may be trodden by all" (60,62).
This speech, concluded with an invitation to take a well-earned rest, fills the victors with delight. In it, Krishna has

referred only to a general divine-asuric situation and has specified no particular mythic "stratagems." One cannot,
however, help but think of the triumphs of Indra; indeed, in one of these, his triumph over Vrtra *, we have seen
Salya's* epic account attribute his success to a "contrivance" (upaya*) proposed by Visnu*.13 One cannot, of
course, insist that it is the Udyogaparvan's three-part sequence that Krishna has in mind. But, as we see from a
second speech by Vyasa*, such general references to the gods can hardly be imagined without Indra's involvement.
Addressing Yudhisthira* who has just declared that he and his brothers can only expect to fall into Hell head
downward (narake... adhasirasah*) for their sins ( 12 :33, 11 ), Vyasa* calls to mind the former battle between the
younger Devas and the older Asuras (12:34, 13) in which the gods, "having made the earth one ocean of blood"
(ekarnavam. mahim* krtva* rudhirena* pariplutam*), slew the Asuras and "obtained heaven" (tridivam. lebhire;
34, I4). One recalls here the younger-elder theme which the epic plays out in connection with Arjuna and
Duryodhana at Krishna's bedside,14 but is also reminded of the theme of conquering heaven having made the
blood-bathed earth a firm foundation. In the battle which Vyasa* is describing, having won the earth (15), the gods
had to slay the Salavrka* brahmins who, promoting adharma (18), sided with the Asuras (16-17).15 Thus the gods
committed the transgression of necessary brahminicide in a fashion reminiscent of the slaying of Drona*. At this
point Vyasa* advises Yudhisthira* to realize that "virtue sometimes takes the form of vice" (adharmarupo*
dharmo;
13 5: 10, 10; see above, Chapter 9, following n. 14.
14See above, beginning of Chapter 5.
15Certain Sa1avrka* wolves are mentioned as figuring in Indra's sins in the Brahmanas* (see AB 7,28; JB 2,
134; Kaus*. Up. 3,1), but there it is to them that he has "given" the Yatis. Perhaps, in a fashion similar to the
handling of the Vrtra* myth, the epic poets have "clarified" this ancient sin which probably always involved
the murder of holy persons (the Yatis are presumably ascetics) into a direct brahminicide.

20) and that he has merely "followed the path formerly trodden by the gods" (devaih * puragatam* margam*; 21).
Moreover, since he has acted "unwillingly, forced by the fault of another" (paradosena* karatah anicchamanah*;
25), and is repentant, it will now be possible for him to achieve expiation (prayascittam*; 26) by performing an
Asvamedha*. The model Vyasa*. cites here is Indra, who presumably after the conquest just cited, performed his
hundred sacrifices (thus the name Satakratu*; 27). But one will recall that it is even more specifically after his
flawed triumphs over Visvarupa* and Vrtra*, and the recovery of his throne from Nahusa*, that Indra is again (?)
absolved of his sins by an Asvamedha* which he performs at the advice of Visnu*.16
At this point a number of themes converge. First, with regard to the Asvamedha*, although traditionally performed
as a rite that gives proof to and expression of the highest sovereignty, it comes, in the epic, to be associated almost
exclusively with expiation.17 Once again we meet with the collusion of Vyasa* and Krishna. Having gotten
permission from Vyasa* to perform this sin-cleansing rite ( 14:70, 15-16),18 Yudhisthira* addresses Krishna:
O mighty-armed one, may you now perform what I tell you, O Acyuta. The enjoyments we enjoy are
acquired by your might, O delighter of the Yadus. Through prowess and intelligence, by you this earth has
been conquered. Let yourself undergo the rites of initiation [diksayasva* tvam atmanam*]. You are our
highest guru. If you perform the sacrifice [tvayistavati*], O knower of dharma, I shall be
165:13, 13; see above, Chapter 9, at n. 18.
17One wonders whether the Brahmana* authors have left unmentioned one of the inherent aspects of this rite,
an expiatory function necessitated by the fact that the attainment of sovereignty would almost inevitably
involve martial acts requiring expiation, or whether the epic authors have innovated.
18It seems that the smoke from the burnt marrow of the horse (14:91,4) and the bath at the conclusion of the
rite (14:90, 13-14) are regarded as the features of the Asvamedha* that are the most sin-cleansing.

free from sin [vipapma *], O mighty one. Surely you are sacrifice, you are imperishable, you are all, you
are dharma, you are Prajapati* [tvam* hi yajno* ksarah sarvastvam dharmastvam* prajapatih*]. [14: 70,
19-20]
I have several times referred to this identification of Krishna with the sacrifice and with Prajapati*, and of Visnu*
with both of these as well.19 In connection with Krishna, we now see that one of the most forceful expressions of
this identification is made where it concerns expiation from sins.
Visnu* performs a similar expiatory function in the Asvamedha* that restores Indra to his throne. Not only, like
"his" incarnation Vyasa*, does he propose the rite, but, like his other incarnation Krishna, who will make
Yudhisthira* "free from sin," he "distributes the sin of brahminicide among trees, rivers, mountains, earth, and
women" so as to make Indra "purified of sin" (putapapma*; 5:13,27-28). But our most important information
comes from the Brahmanas*. One best appreciates the implications of the identification of Krishna with the
sacrifice (and with Prajapati*) at a point concerning expiation in the well-known formula of the sacrificial texts:
"Visnu* is the sacrifice" (yajno* vai visnus*; SB* 3,2, 1,38, etc).
Gonda, in discussing this formula, says that Vissnu* "is not only the sacrifice or its life (cf. SB* 4,2,3, 10), he is
also its guardian and protector:... Visnu* guards that of the sacrifice which is badly sacrificed."20 Indeed, in the
texts where this formula is used, or where related notions are aired, Visnu* is identified with the sacrifice most
frequently at points where his restorative power, his power to "atone," is at the very forefront of the authors'
interests. Thus, not only does he "guard" or "protect" the rite (see TS 3, 1, 10,3; 6,2,9,2; cf. SB* 4,2,2,4) but "heals"
the sacrificer who is ill ( TS 2,3, 11, 2,), maintains "continuity" ( TS

3,5,1,4), and "unites" the "broken" sacrifice (TS 3,2,5,3; cf. 6,1,4,4). But most interesting are the passages where
Visnu * is spoken of as the god who brings about "atonement" (prayascitti*; cf. Mbh. 12:34,26, cited just above21
for sacrifices badly performed. For instance, we are told that should the diksita* (a person undergoing preparation
for a religious ceremony) fail to confine his speech during the diksa* to appropriate mantras, the sacrifice abandons
him: "In that case, then, let him mutter a rk*, or yajus addressed to Visnu*, for Visnu* is the sacrifice [yajno* vai
visnus*]: thereby he again gains hold of the sacrifice; and this is the atonement [prayascittih*] for that
[transgression]" (SB* 3,2,1,38). These words are nearly echoed in Satapatha* 1,7,4,20, a passage we shall turn to
in Chapter 12. But on the present topic, the most informative passage comes from the Aitareya Brahmana*, part of
a long discussion of "penances" (prayascitti* again) which can be performed for various ritual mistakes. In
particular, if the fire offering is spilled or boils over, after touching water one moves the right hand over what fell
out and mutters this mantra:
"May a third go to heaven to the gods as a sacrifice; might I obtain thence wealth! May a third go to the air,
to the Pitaras...; may a third go to the earth, to men .... "Then he mutters the Visnu-Varuna* verse, yayor
ojasa* sthabita* rajamsi* ("by whose force were established the spaces"AV 7,25,1). For Visnu* watches
over what is performed badly in the sacrifice, and Varuna* over what is performed well [visnur* vai
yajnasya* duristam* pati* varuna svistam*]. To appease both of them this penance (is appropriate). [7,5,2-
4]22

The line of thought seems to move from the commission of a ritual mistake, to the re-establishment of a proper
relationship with the three worlds, to a verse honoring Visnu * and Varuna* for their parts in stabilizing these
"spaces," thus achieving prayascitti*. Varuna's* role in "establishing" the "spaces" no doubt evokes his relation to
the rta* and thus implies the supervision of what is well "ordered" or "performed well." But Visnu's* role of
overseeing what is "performed badly"which would, after all, seem to explain the need for prayascitti*seems to
recall something else. As discussed in Chapter 6, from the Brahmanas* on through the epics and Puranas*,
Visnu's* three steps are taken to help recover for the gods what was once theirs, what, for one reason or another,
they have lost. In other words, the steps have a restorative value. Moreover, by marking off the three zones, Visnu*
recreates an order, "establishes spaces"23 which the gods, or the sacrificer, may then conquer.
In connection with the Aitareya passage, these last points are somewhat speculative. To confirm them, one would
have to demonstrate that a connection has been drawn between Visnu's* expiatory function and his three steps. As
far as I know, the sacrificial texts are silent here. But the epic is not, or so it would seem from the words which
Yudhisthira*, after his Santiparvan* laments and confessions, says to Krishna: "We have got back the kingdom
and the earth stands under [our] sway. Through your grace, O you whose steps traversed the three worlds
[trilokagativikrama], victory and foremost fame have been won, and we have not fallen off from dharma"
(12:45,18-19). Yudhisthira's* choice of this epithetcertainly unusual for Krishnathus connects the strides with the
establishment of sway over the earth, the attainment of victory and fame, and the maintenance of dharma, all
through Krishna's grace.
We have thus moved from ritual faults to personal sins. Whereas in the Brahmanas*, Visnu* expiates the one, in
the epic,
23 Note that in the AV mantra cited in the AB passage, rajas is plural; according to M-W (S.V.), this
usually signifies "three spaces," sometimes six.

Visnu * and Krishna expiate the other,24 that is, Visnu* provides atonement for the sins of Indra, Krishna for those
of Yudhisthira*. This shift from sacrificial faults to moral faults is as smooth as the shift from sacrificial virtues to
moral virtues in the mythology of Sri*, and it is a transition that by no means implies a break in continuity. The
moral defects by which Yudhisthira* achieves the deaths of the four Kuru marshals are committed within a great
sacrifice of battle, one which he has "performed badly." And the atonement which frees him from sin is achieved
by the "king of rites" (SB* 13,2,2,1), the Asvamedha*, supervised by the avatara* of the god who himself
embodies the expiatory function of the sacrifice.
24 See Gita* 18,66: "Abandoning all dharmas, go to me as your sole refuge; from all sins I shall release
you; be not grieved" (sarvadharman*parityajya mam* ekam* saranam* vraja / aham* tva*
sarvapapebhyo* moksayisyami* ma* sucah*) (my translation).

Chapter 12
Epic Eschatology
A curious fact about the Hindu tradition is that from Vedic through Puranic * times there is no myth of a once-and-
for-all end of the world. The "optimism" of the Vedas and the cyclical time of later Hinduism seem to make such a
notion impossible. Yet within the cyclical view, the world does end over and over again. So it is with the great
myth of the pralaya and, on a lesser scale, with the general myth of the "end of the yuga." And in loose connection
with these official time schemes, numerous myths offer descriptions of world-ending destructions, cataclysmic
reversals of the world order (such as most avatara* myths, the Banasura* myth, tripuradahana*, and the
destruction of Daksa's* sacrifice).
In recent years, several scholars have raised suspicions that the Mahabharata*, which tells about the end of the
yuga previous to ours and involves an avatara*, incorporates a variety of rich and perhaps very ancient,
eschatological symbolism. Stig Wikander, in his comparisons of the Mahabharata* with Iranian and Scandinavian
myths and legends, has noticed that in both the Iranian and Indian epics there stands, over and against the
differentiated forces of "good" (like the Pandavas*), one dominating "demonic" figureAfrasiyab* or Duryodhana
who leads the otherwise undifferentiated forces of "evil."1 As Wikander says, these epic figures correspond, in
their leadership roles, to such mythical "demon"-leaders as the Scandinavian Loki and the Iranian Ahriman. This
suggests to him

that an Indo-European eschatology, known from the mythologies of Scandinavia and Iran, has also survived,
transposed into epic, in Iran and India. However, although Scandinavian mythology yields a single leader of the
demonic host in the person of Loki, the Scandinavian epic tradition closest to the Mahabharata *the account of the
Battle of Brávellirdoes not. Nor, as Dumézil points out, does the role of Odinn in the Scandinavian eschatological
myth correspond to the same Odinn's roleas the treacherous impersonator of Bruno at the Battle of Brávellir.2
These disjunctions raise questions which are as yet unsolved. If the Indo-Iranian epic parallels do result from
mythic transpositions, perhaps the parallels between the Mahabharata* and the Battle of Brávellir show us
something of the older heroic story, not without eschatological or at least "age-ending" themes,3 that these myths
helped to reshape. But Duryodhana does not provide the only hint that eschatological themes have surfaced in the
Mahabharata*. Nor must one suppose that, during the story's presumably long history and development, only one
eschatology has been "transposed" into it.
To date, besides Wikander, two authors have expressed their views on this subject, one pressing the Indo-
European quest further, the other turning back to more recent periods in the traditions of India.
Dumézil and Biardeau
Notwithstanding the contribution of Wikander, Dumézil has gone farthest in examining Indo-European
eschatologies for parallels to the Mahabharata*. In fact, Wikander seems to accept Dumézil's analysis, as Dumézil
does his. But although they do

not contradict each other, neither has attempted to show how the two sets of results might support each other.4
Dumézil's work has proceeded in essentially two steps: first, in the chapter, "Le drame du monde," of his Les Dieux
des Germains,5 he has made the initial direct confrontation of the Indian drama with the Scandinavian myth of the
Ragnarök, the "Doom of the Gods" (more commonly, but corruptly, Ragnarökr, "Twilight of the Gods"), and
second, still loyal to his original conclusions and supposedly reinforcing them, he has, in Mythe et épopée, I,
examined one additional episode from each traditionthe Scandinavian and the epicand proposed parallels for
these.6 Dumézil has in mind an ancient eschatological intrigue developing in three phases and found in both the
Mahabharata * and the myth of the Ragnarök: "It is thus, in outline, a cosmic conflict which takes place in three
'epochs': the rigged game [jeu truqué], by which Evil triumphs for a long time, removing from the scene the
representatives of Good; the great battle in which the Good takes revenge, eliminating the Evil definitively; the
government of the good."7 Let us follow Dumézil's discussion of these three "époques" in the Scandinavian
traditions8 and then see whether he can justly point to a similar scansion in the Mahabharata*.
(1) Jeu truqué. The drama of the world's end begins in the past, a precarious balance as the axis of their society
having been established by the gods at the end of the war between the two divine groups, the Aesir and the Vanir.9
The functional posts are manned by several gods: Odinn the magical sovereign

and patron of war, Thor the sole bearer of the thunderbolt, and Njordr and Freyr the givers of riches, pleasure, and
peace. But no god, not even Odinn, offers any kind of high moral example: the world is without a Mitra. The gods
"govern the world just as it is, on a moral level that is rather low and with little of the ideal."10 There are,
however, two sons of OdinnBaldr and Hodrwho seem to make up for this lack. In Hodr and his role as the blind
instrument of fate, Dumézil sees a continuation of certain aspects of "Bhaga the blind," the Vedic "minor sovereign
god" subordinate to Mitra and Varuna *, who is responsible for the apportionment of goods. And in Baldr, he sees
a continuation of another important "minor sovereign," Aryaman, patron of the arya* society.11 The ideal is
especially found in Baldr, and to show this Dumézil cites a passage, which we shall re-examine, from the
Gylfaginning (The Beguiling of Gylfi) of Snorri Sturluson:12
He is the best of them and everyone sings his praises. He is so fair of face and bright that a splendor
radiates from him, and there is one flower so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; it is the whitest of all
flowers [Turville-Petre: the Ox-eye daisy, or matricary13]. From that you can tell how beautiful his body is,
and how bright his hair. He is the wisest of the gods, and the sweetest-spoken, and the most merciful, but it
is a characteristic of his that no judgment of his may be realized.14

As Dumézil says, he represents a high ideal, the highest of all, no doubt, but a thwarted onenot to be realized with
the world as it is.
Then tragedy strikes. Baldr has dreams which indicate to him that his life is menaced, and when he tells the other
gods, they seek to protect him. Frigg, Odinn's wife and Baldr's mother, obtains an oath from every objectfire and
water, metals, stones, trees, sicknesses, beasts, birds, serpentsthat it will do Baldr no harm. The gods then take up
the pastime of hurling objects at Baldr and delighting in his invulnerability. But they have failed to reckon on the
maliciousness of Loki who, under disguise, obtains from Frigg the information that she has omitted to extract an
oath from one plant, the mistletoe, which she regarded as too young.15 Loki secures the plant and comes back with
it to the assembly.
Now Hodr was standing on the outer edge of the circle of men because he was blind. Loki asked him:
"Why aren't you throwing darts at Baldr?" He replied: "Because I can't see where Baldr is, and, another
thing, I have no weapon." Then Loki said: "You go and do as the others are doing.... I will show you where
he is standing; throw this twig at him." Hodr took the mistletoe and aimed it at Baldr as directed by Loki.
The dart went right through him and he fell dead to the ground. This was the greatest misfortune ever to
befall gods and men.16
This is the disastrous jeu truqué, rigged game, of the Scandinavian eschatological drama, the prelude to the "doom
of the gods." There are, however, certain sequels that are of interest. When the gods recover from their shock,
Frigg promises that her affection and favor can be won by the god who will ride to Hel to ask the demoness of that
name, Loki's own daughter,

whether Baldr can somehow be ransomed. A son of Odinn, Hermod, does the honors, riding on Odinn's horse; but
when he inquires if Baldr may ride back with him, Hel, "to see whether Baldr was loved as much as people said,"
devised a test:
"If everything in the world, both dead or alive, weeps for him, then he shall go back to the Aesir, but he
shall remain with Hel if anyone objects or will not weep."... [Upon this good news] the Aesir sent
messengers throughout the whole world to ask for Baldr to be wept out of Hel; and everything did that....
When the messengers were coming home, having made a good job of their errand, they met with a giantess
sitting in a cave; she gave her name as Thokk. They asked her to weep Baldr out of Hel. She answered:
"Thokk will weep dry tears... let Hel hold what she has." It is thought that the giantess there was Loki.17
Though Loki could not be slain at the site of Baldr's death since it was a sanctuary, he is finally caught and chained
to a cave by the gods.18 But the chains will someday break, and he will return at the head of his demonic offspring
and various other minions of evil at the time of the Ragnarök.
(2) The great battle of the Ragnarök. No detailed discussion of the war is necessary. In a fashion similar to the
climactic battle of the Zoroastrian tradition,19 each god, including those connected with the three functions, faces
off against a single formidable adversary; but in a fashion dissimilar to the Zoroastrian battle, most of the
godseven taking their foes with themmeet their doom, the chief exception being Vidar,

who steps forth to avenge Odinn and to save the world from being swallowed, that is, totally annihilated, by the
Fenrir wolf.20
(3) "Renaissance." The "rebirth" thus made possible is multidimensionalcosmic, "political," individual:
At that time the earth will rise out of the sea and be green and fair.... Vidar and Vali [Baldr's avenger
against Hodr] will be living,... and they will inhabit Idavoll where Asgard used to be. And the sons of Thor,
Modi and Magni, will come there and possess Mjollnir [Thor's hammer]. After that Baldr and Hodr will
come from Hel. They will sit down together and converse, calling to mind their hidden lore and talking
about things that happened in the past.21
These two, both personally revived in some inexplicit manner, will head up the government of the renewed world
in Odinn's hall (cf. Voluspa *, 62). In this return of the "ideal" ruler, Dumézil sees Baldr's collaboration with Hodr
as a continuation of their identities as minor sovereignsa pattern for which Dumézil then finds parallels in the
Mahabharata*.
Dumézil finds a similar three-phase drama in the Mahabharata*, but not without evoking some questions. His
arrangement of the epic drama seems designed mainly to bring into relief the two figures whom he identifies as
further continuations of the "minor sovereigns": the blind king Dhrtarastra* as a continuation of Bhaga and, more
particularly, of Fate or Destiny; and Vidura as a transposition of Aryaman, the overseer of the integrity of the
Bharata* family, kula. Once again, let us take up the "three epochs" in order. Here, for each one, Dumézil gives a
convenient summary in Les Dieux des Getmains:22

(1) Jeu truqué. "In the first decisive 'temps' of the action, Duryodhana [-demon] induces the blind Dhrtarastra * [-
*Destiny], despite the warnings of Vidura [-*Aryaman], to organize the game of dice in which, normally,
Yudhisthira* [-*Mitra] would be invincible but in which, by the supernatural fixing of the dice, he will be defeated
and, as a result, obliged to disappear for a long time." First, Dumézil is able to find certain parallels with the
missile-throwing game of the Scandinavian gods. Each is a game in which tragedy occurs through some sort of
treachery. In each case a blind personage (both, according to Dumézil, continuations of *Bhaga) serves as an
instrument of fate, impelled by a character of demonic stature. Both games end with the disappearance of an
"ideal" figure who will return to rule only after a long time. Dumézil then discusses certain divergences which he
attributes to changing conditions over long stretches of time and space. Some of these, however, seem rather
marked. The character of the two games varies widely: Dhrtarastra* is a blind accomplice, knowing full well what
he is doing, whereas Hodr is innocent; Duryodhana rules after the dice game, whereas Loki is chained. But none of
these "divergences" is more important than a fact which escapes mention in Dumézil's treatment. Whereas one can
truly say of Baldr that he plays "complacently at the game of projectiles"23 because everyone thinks him
invulnerable, one cannot say that Yudhisthira* "should fear nothing from the dice game, since he is the best of
players."24 He cannot be the best, for, as the deceitful gamester Sakuni* says to Duryodhana, Yudhisthira* is "fond
of dicing, but he doesn't know how to cast" (dyutapriyas* ... na ca janati* devitum; 2:44,18). Nor does he have
nothing to fear. On this point his most forceful statement concerns the invitation to the rematch after the disaster, or
near disaster, of the

first match: "This challenge to a game of dice comes from the command of the old [king]. Even knowing that it
will cause destruction, I cannot get out of it" (2:67,4).
Yudhisthira * and Baldr, then, are different sorts of "losers"; and one begins to suspect that it is not a matter of
divergences in these games so much as real differences. Yudhisthira* has already been a king whereas Baldr has
not. Yudhisthira* goes into exile, Baldr dies. These and the variances cited by Dumézil put enough strain on the
comparison to make one question whether Baldr and Yudhisthira*, who have so little in common other than their
"ideal" character and "ideal" rule, should really be compared. Both represent an "ideal," but are there no other
archaic ideals than those associated with Mitra and the "minor sovereigns"?
(2) The great battle of the Mahabharata*. "In the second decisive 'temps,' Duryodhana [-Demon] mounts a
formidable coalition against Yudhisthira* [-*Mitra] and his brothers and allies, and in the battle which follows, the
Pandavas* [-trifunctional gods incarnate] each kill an adversary of their own rank, including Duryodhana." All
these points (except for a Scandinavian *Mitra) have reasonably close parallels not only in the Scandinavian drama
but in the Iranian, and once again detailed discussion is not needed. Here there truly seem to be divergences and
different orientations, and Dumézil is attentive to these. Thus in Scandinavia most of the "good" gods die; in Iran
the "good" Amesha Spentas triumph; and in India, though the "good" heroes triumph in the name of the gods, there
are also "good" heroes who fight for the "bad" side. I will return to some of these problems.
(3) "Renaissance." "Finally, in the renovation which follows the crisis, the blind Dhrtarastra* [-*Destiny] and the
just Vidura [-*Aryaman], fully reconciled, back up the work which is most fully exemplified in the person of
Yudhisthira* [-*Mitra]." This definition of the "renaissance," which, according to Dumézil, allows for direct
parallels with the

return of Baldr (-*Aryaman and -*Mitra)25 and Hodr (-*Bhaga, "Blind Destiny"), again creates difficulties with
his interpretation. Essentially, it is a matter of determining what constitutes the "reborn" world of the epic, and I
doubt that Yudhisthira's * postwar rule can be considered idyllic. Before the battle, the poets can refer to him
gracefully as the dharmaraja*, the ideal ruler;26 but after the war, in which his sins are the most instrumental in
attaining victory, he is the reluctant king of a decimated earth whose chief act is the performance of a sin-cleansing
Asvamedha*. To be sure, his postwar assistants include Dhrtarastra* and Vidura, who may well be prolongations
of Bhaga and Aryaman; but it seems extravagant to assign eschatologically significant roles to these two old
counselors whose most important moments, after the battle, are their deaths.27 The traditional Hindu view,28
which is best followed here, links the beginning of the new age not to the rule of Yudhisthira*, but rather to the
rule which he and his counselors set up for Arjuna's grandson Pariksit*. He will be an ideal ruler, but, like Baldr,
the ruler of an attenuated age, retaining the ideal and the hope of a fresh beginning but without his glorious yet
imperfect grandfathers (the trifunctionally arrayed Pandavas*)just as Baldr must rule without the former gods
(likewise trifunctionally arrayed), worthy of reverence yet "with little of the ideal."
Dumézil, however, has reached other conclusions on the question of Pariksit's* birth which allow him, even while
calling attention to it as a key eschatological theme, to set it apart. Beyond the eschatological intrigue in three
phases, he sees "the rest of the epic, the episode of the embryo with its antecedents and consequences [the birth of
Pariksit*], the

opposition of Krishna and Asvatthaman *, and through them of Visnu* and Siva*, being perhaps a posterior
adjunction or at least the considerable rehandling of a non-Saivite* story which it would be vain to pretend to
reconstitute."29 Thus this crucial scene, which Dumézil has so brilliantly brought into the open in Mythe et épopée,
I, takes a back seat to the "three epochs" he had previously outlined in Les dieux des Germains. Of the three, only
the battle, the most general of all, seems certain to pass as a common theme. The embryo episode, which is central
to Biardeau's treatment of the epic crisis, will bear further scrutiny.
The alignment of the eschatological crisis of the epic with the Hindu myth of the pralaya, which has only begun to
take shape in the ongoing studies of Madeleine Biardeau, was anticipated by Dumézil with regard to the opposition
of Krishna and Asvatthaman*, Visnu* and Siva*, over the fate of the embryo.30 But Dumézil drops the matter
here, suggesting that this opposition "corresponds to a state of the mythology that is post-Vedic, late, already
nearly Hindu."31 He finds no way in which these themes might be combined in an overarching model with the
three-phase drama he considers older. Here, by introducing the pralaya as a possible structuring myth, Biardeau
opens up a number of new perspectives.
Although she has yet to address herself directly to the episodes which make up the first and third "epochs" of
Dumézil's scheme, she distrusts the Indo-European comparison: "The cosmic crisis which forms the intrigue of the
epic does not have an exact analogue in the most ancient literature, whereas one can find its model in the Puranic*
accounts of the reabsorption and recreation of the world."32

Although Puranic * tradition commonly distinguishes three types of pralaya, and even though the three form "a
whole"33 and are often narrated in sequence, it is the naimittika-pralaya, "the occasional reabsorption," which
claims Biardeau's attention. There is no convincing reason to reject the pralaya as a "model" for the epic on the
grounds that the myth is Puranic* and "late." Biardeau speaks of the epic as being concerned more with the cycle
of the yugas and the appearance of avataras* and less with the kalpa cycle, which it leaves in the background.34
But if the kalpa system is in the background, allusions to the naimittika-pralaya abound throughoutin particular, as
she convincingly shows, in the theophany of the Bhagavad Gita*.35 Moreover, the epic gives a pralaya account of
its own (3:186,56-78).
Biardeau shows that there are essentially three phases to the pralaya. First comes a terrible drought and the
desiccation of the entire earth. In the second and third phases occurs what she calls the "double pralaya": first a
"reabsorption" by Kalagnirudra*36 (Siva*) of the three dead and desiccated worlds through yogic fire; and second,
a "reabsorption" of the remains (ashes) and of all beings in the flood waters upon which Narayana* (Visnu*)
reposes in his yogic sleep, thence to recreate the three worlds through Brahma*. She detects this three-act drama
beneath the surface of the Mahabharata*.37 Thus (1) the desiccation of the earth corresponds to the symbols and
intrigues that set up the oppositions between the Pandavas* and the Kauravas, between dharma and adharma, in the
early books;38

summary on a letter from Biardeau of June 4, 1971.

(EPHE, LXXVIII, 157-58); the burning of

(2) the burning of the three worlds, presided over by Rudra-Siva *, corresponds to the epic war which culminates
in the extinction of the Kuru-Pandava* line when Asvatthaman* (possessed by Siva*) destroys the last hope of its
continuity the embryo in the womb of Uttara*, wife of Arjuna's slain son Abhimanyu; and (3) the deluge and the
recreation of the worlds correspond to the womb in which the embryo lies and Krishna's revival of the stillborn
baby.
Biardeau is still investigating the parallels, so a hasty judgment on the confrontation of these two dramas should
not be formed. But some impressions are worth expressing. Negatively, there are difficulties in accepting any close
ties in the first two phases of the schema. As Biardeau notes in her letter (see n. 37), there is little symbolic
correspondence between the desiccation of the earth and the signs and situations preceding the battle.39 And in
phase two, the burning of the three worlds presents no "dualistic" battle like that in the epic war or, for that matter,
in the Scandinavian and Iranian myths of the end of the world. Nor is it possible to put the whole battle under
Siva-Asvatthaman's* sign, like the destructive phase of the pralaya. As Dumézil says, until the Sauptikaparvan,
"the activity of Asvatthaman* is very subordinate."40 Keeping the divine

Khandava* forest as "a new figure of the war of destruction to come" (see above, Chapter 4, n. 1); more
fragmentary, Jarasamdha's* imprisoning of the hundred kings as a "new image of the end of the world"
(see above, Chapter 10, n. 60); Draupadi's* polyandrous marriage, through Siva's* involvement, as an
eschatological destruction of rules "necessary to the renewal of the world" (see above, Chapter 3, n. 9); and
Draupadi's* refusal of Karna-Surya* as a refusal of the solar hero "who symbolizes the conflagration of the
world" ("Brahmanes* et potiers," p. 42, n. 2) (my translations).
39. Based on this comparison, Biardeau also proposes an answer to why there are "good" heroes on the "bad"
side: Karna* is the son of Surya*, the sun which, "at the end of the cosmic cycle is narrowly associated with
Siva* in the task of destruction" (EPHE, LXXVIII, 152; also EMH, 3, P. 82 and n. 1; my translation). But this
does not explain why incarnations of the Rudras and Maruts (Krpa* and Krtavarman*), of one of the Vasus
(Bhisma*), or of Brhaspati* (Drona*) should side with the Kurus.

and heroic planes of action distinct, it would be more correct to say that the battle itself, up to the Sauptikaparvan,
is presided over by Krishna.
On the positive side, however, Biardeau indicates that pralaya imagery is frequently employed in descriptions of
the epic action. A striking instance occurs in the third phase of her schema, when Subhadra * pleads with her
brother Krishna to revive the stillborn child: "Surely, just by wishing it you could revive the three worlds
[lokamstrinjivayethah*] if they were dead; what then of this cherished one born dead of your sister's son?"
(14:66,17). For the most part, however, such pralaya imagery occurs in similes and metaphors, where it certainly
does not serve to structure the epic drama. It would be more accurate to say that the pralaya mythology
complements the epic story as a cosmological metaphor than to say that it lends form to the story as a background
myth. It is true, as Biardeau points out, that in the Gita*, Krishna refers to the pralaya as the backdrop against
which Arjuna is to understand the cataclysmic battle to come; but this, as Krishna says, is a divine, one might say
ultimate secret, delivered only to his dearest bhakta (see Gita* 11,54). I will try to demonstrate that these
sequences in the Mahabharata* draw their basic structure not from this "universe of bhakti,"41 but from other, no
doubt older, mythic and ritual scenariosjoined together and integrated not under the sign of the pralaya but under
that of the Brahmanic* sacrifice.
The Sauptikaparvan and the Destruction of Daksa's* Sacrifice
One principle, suggested by the Mahabharata* text itself, has proved valuable at several points: to examine
whether there is some relation between the many myths narrated in the course of the text (usually regarded as
interpolations or interruptions)
41. I use Biardeau's term here, which she uses (EMH, 3, especially, p. 84) to describe the cosmology of
pralaya and pratisarga.

and the juncture in the narrative at which they are told.42 Several fruitful paths have been opened up by comparing
such myths with immediately foregoing or forthcoming incidents in the epic plot.43 It seems likely that the texture
of the epic has included a balance of didactic (including mythic) and narrative portions for as long as it has existed
in India, and many of the interpretive myths seem to have conserved their place in the narrative for a long time.
Nowhere does this seem more likely than at the end of the Sauptikaparvan. Asked there how Asvatthaman * could
have carried out his night raid, Krishna tells Yudhisthira* that it was through the grace of Siva*. "I know
Mahadeva* truly" (tattvena), he adds, "and also his various former deeds" (puranani* karmani* vividhani*;
10:17,8). The second deed he recites, the one he concludes with and links directly to the preceding events
(10:18,24-26),44 is Siva's* destruction of the sacrifice of the gods (elsewhere of Daksa*).45
42. This procedural principle was first articulated by Joseph Dahlmann, Das Mahabharata* als Epos und
Rechtsbuch: Problem aus Altindiens Cultur- und Literaturgeschichte (Berlin: Felix L. Dames, 1899), pp.
119-22.
43. See especially Chapter 7 (myth of Sri* and the five Indras told after Draupadi's* Svayamvara*) and
Chapters 9 and 10 (myth of Indra's sins told to Yudhisthira* before the war).
44. In a just verdict, H. D. Velankar, ed., Sauptikaparvan, CE, "Introduction," p. xxix, refers to the first
"former deed"a myth about the lingam* (10:17)as "rather extraneous." Critical studies of the Sauptikaparvan
are few: in addition to Dumézil (see above, n. 6), see the "inversionist" views of Holtzmann (Mahabharata*
und seine Theile, II, 201-3) and the "solar myth" views of Ludwig ("Mythische grundlage des Mahabharata*,"
p. 10) in which the night raid, brought on by the "Winter God" Siva*, symbolizes the "last night-frost in
spring"!
45. I will use the term Daksayajna*, although Daksa* does not appear in the "early" versions of the myth, by
which I refer to those in the Brahmanas* (see Bhattacharji, Indian Theogony, pp. 121-22) as well, it would
seem, as the one at the end of the Sauptikaparvan; see also Mbh. 7:173,41 where Daksa* gets only an
interpolated line. Where Daksa* does not appear, I put the term in quotes.
Recent studies of the Daksayajna* myth include Bhattacharji, Indian Theogony, pp. 121-24; Jan Gonda,

Krishna's cue should not be ignored, but to follow it means to face some new hurdles. Krishna's account of the
myth does not present it in its full scope. Yet the events of the parvan often seem to reflect the fully developed
myth. It would seem then that while the myth told at the end originally served to complement the events of the
parvan, the parvan itself has been elaborated in the light of later versions of the myth. By following the course of
the Sauptika itself episode by episode (I can unfortunately reduce it to no less than fourteen), let us see whether the
myth (or the developing tradition of myths) of the destruction of Daksa's * sacrifice can be read as its companion
tale.
(1) Absence of Krishna. In a matter about which the epic tells us surprisingly little, Krishna, his kinsman Satyaki*,
and the five Pandavas* have all conveniently absented themselves from the victory camp on the very evening of
Asvatthaman's* night raid. After plundering the Kuru camp for goods, servants, and other royal spoils (9:61,33),
the victors rest until Krishna interrupts: "'For the sake of acting auspiciously [mangalarthaya*], we should stay
outside the camp.' Having said, 'So be it,' all the Pandavas*, as also Satyaki*, went outside, together with
Vasudeva*, for the sake of acting auspiciously" (mangalartha*; 9:61,35-36). While Krishna's words are mys-

terious and refer only to some unexplained "welfare" (man-gala *), the lack of explanation has been sensed in two
Devanagari* manuscripts, in which Krishna seems to refer to the role of the goddess as Kalaratri*, the "Night of
Time": "Where the goddess Victory is [jayanti* yatra devi*], however, do not go about there for long. This is my
request, arranged at the beginning of battle" (9,380*; following 9:61,35). This would seem appropriate, since
Krishna did have Arjuna (likewise only in the Northern recension) honor Durga* on the eve of battle
(Bhismaparvan*, Appendix I, n. 1), praising her not only as Victory (vijaye jaye; line 11) but as Bhadrakali* and
Mahakali* (line 9). But within the Sauptikaparvan, Krishna makes way more for Siva* than for the goddess.
More interesting than the reference to Devi* is the implication that Krishna has arranged this exodus beforehand.
Can the sloka* be trusted here? The only other passage which bears on these events would seem at first to make it
doubtful. Just after Krishna has urged that the night be spent outside the camp, the Pandavas* send him off to
Hastinapura* to tell Dhrtarastra* and Gandhari*, as gently as possible, of their sons' deaths. There, having
comforted them, Krishna gets up suddenly and begs their leave, explaining: "Evil has entered the mind of Drona's*
son; ... he has indicated the thought of slaying the Pandavas* in the night" (9:61,68). Thus it would seem that
Krishna does not have any foreknowledge of what will happen. But when he rejoins the Pandavas* that very night,
presumably not only to rescue them but to foil Asvatthaman's* plan, he merely sits down and tells them what
happened at the Kuru court. Here, where we know that he knows, he is troublingly silent. We are thus left with the
impression that the added sloka* is right, that Krishna has absented himself and the Pandavas* by design.
In the Daksayajna* myth, we find a variety of attitudes expressed in different versions about the roles of Visnu*
and Siva*. Some do not mention Visnu* at all, some not until the

end,46 and some say that Daksa's * rite was dedicated to Visnu* (Mbh. 12:283,21 V; Bhag*. P. 4,2,34; Kurma* P.
15,23,24; Siva* P. 2,2,27,37-38). But all agree on one point: Visnu* was not present when the sacrifice was
destroyed. Some texts are quite explicit, although just as mysterious as the Mahabharata* is on the absence of
Krishna. According to the Kurma*, "all the gods came for the sake of shares, Indra and so forth; but they did not
see the god Isana* or Narayana* Hari" (15,21). Most pointedly, the Bhagavata* says: "Having formerly perceived
exactly this [destruction], the lotus-born god [Brahma*] and Narayana*, the soul of all, did not go to the sacrifice"
(4,5,3). Or Visnu* may be present until the destruction takes place. Thus the Vamana* tells us: "Seeing Samkara*
with eyes reddened with anger, Hari retired from that place and stood concealed [sthanadapakramya* ...
antarhitah* sthitah*] in Kubjamra* [a tirtha*]" (5,1); and in the Siva*, Visnu* is warned by a celestial voice to
leave the sacrifice (2,2,31,34), which he doesafter a standoff fight with Siva's* agent Virabhadra*both he and
Brahma* going to their respective lokas (37,41-44) just before the destruction begins.
It is apparent that in these absences of Krishna and Visnu* we are, on the levels of both myth and epic, confronted
by a statement about the theological complementarity of Visnu* and Siva*.47 But we must postpone discussion of
this (see item 14 below) until we see what is made of it by the epic itself.
(2) Celebrants and outsiders. Asvatthaman* and his two allies, Krpa* and Krtavarman*, have entered a forest near
the camp just absented by Krishna, and there, as night sets in, Asvatthaman* alone remains awake. Taking his cue
(upadesa*) from a bird of prey which he sees massacre a flock of sleeping crows, he forms the plan which
Krishna became aware of at Hastinapura*: he will kill all the Pandavas* and Pancalas* while they

is a late concern. Below I discuss a Brahmanic* precursor.

are sleeping.48 Awakened and hearing of this scheme, Krpa * and Krtavarman* are filled with shame, but in a
series of exchanges they are persuaded. Of special interest is Asvatthaman's* first response:
The Pancalas* are roaring out, shouting, and laughing; filled with joy, they are blowing their conches in a
hundred ways, and beating their drums. The tumultuous sound of their musical instruments, mingled with
the blare of their conches, is frightful, and, borne by the wind, it fills up, as it were, all the points of the
compass [disah* purayativa*]. Very great is the sound heard from the neighing horses and the grunting
elephants, and the lion-roar of the heroes. [10:1,59-61]
Having depicted this festive gathering with what one might call its world-wide repercussions, Asvatthaman* turns,
in sharp contrast, to the plight of himself and his fellows: "In this vast carnage, only we three remain.... I regard
this as a reversal of Time" (manye kalasya* paryayam; 63-64). This argument for the night raid thus centers on a
pattern of reversals, juxtapositions: on one side is festivity, on the other embittered isolation; on one side inclusion,
on the other exclusion.
Though the divine emotions may differ from the human anguish and pathos of the three Kuru survivors, the
essential pattern holds. Siva* is excluded from a celebration whose universal proportions only grow with the
enlargement of the universe from text to text: if it is the gods alone who take part in some apparently early versions
(Brahmanas*; Mbh. 7: 173,50"the thirty"; 10:18), the Vulgate version in the Mahabharata* has the sacrifice shared
in by the inhabitants of the three worlds (12:283,5-8V), and the Vamana* Purana* extends this to the fourteen
worlds (4,9). But, most crucial, Asvatthaman*, like Siva*, has heretofore been deprived of a "share." The very core
of the Daksayajna* myth is that Siva* has been allowed no share (bhaga*) in the sacrifice. For Asvatthaman* the
matter is less obvious but no less important.
48. He does not know the Pandavas* are absent; see also 9:65,33.

To clarify the sense in which Asvatthaman's * share is still unclaimed involves discussing what is probably the
fundamental symbolism shaping the Mahabharata* war: that of the ranayajna* (5:57,12; 154,4; cf. sastrayajna*,
5:139,29, and description thereof), "the sacrifice of battle." Although a general analogy between war and sacrifice
in the epic has been long recognized,49 few of its implications have been worked out. One of these concerns the
attainment of heaven: Yudhisthira* assumes that it is heroes "who poured out their bodies into the [sacrificial] fire
of battle" [juhuvurye sarirani* ranavahnau*; [18:2,2] who should obtain heaven, and Narada* tells him that he
sees Duryodhana there because the latter has fulfilled this requirement (18:1,14). A "heaven of heroes" (viraloka*)
finds a place in other Indo-European afterworlds,50 but India's thoroughgoing articulation of the warrior's death as
a sacrifice is probably unique.51 A second implication concerns the epic's use of the terms bhaga* and amsa*,
"share, portion."52 Dumezil* has pointed to the importance of these terms in connection with the incarnations of
the "portions" of various gods on earth. But they are also used with the combined meaning, pertinent to both the
sacrifice and the battlefield, of "victim." It is interesting to note who it is that determines such war- "shares." In one
crucial instance Krishna delegates Salya* as Yudhisthira's* share.53 But more generally the senapati*, marshal,
performs this task. For the Pandavas* this position was filled throughout the entire war by the Pancala* prince

dyumna, born, like his sister Draupadi *, from the sacrificial fire and himself "a portion of Agni" (agnerbhagam*;
var. agneramsam*; 1:61,87), in fact, "an auspicious portion of Agni" (agnerbhagam* subham*; 15: 39, 14). In a
key passage (5: 161,5-10), as the Pandava* army approaches the battlefield, this indispensable ally,54 Agni's own
"auspicious portion," assigns each of his major warriors an appropriate "victim." "Having apportioned [vibhajya]
those warriors individually and collectively, that mighty bowman of the hue of fire [jvalavarna*] fixed Drona* as
his own portion" (amsa*; 10). This fatality, when it is accomplished, will then lead Dhrtarastra* to remark: "It is
Asvatthaman* who was created the slayer of Dhrstadyumna* by the high-souled [Drona*], even as the Pancala*
prince . . . was [created to be the slayer] of Drona*" (7:166,14). In this context we understand Asvatthaman's*
various vows to avenge his father's death by slaying Dhrstadyumna*: the latter will be his share, and the sacrifice
of battle will not be complete until Asvatthaman* has claimed it.
(3 and 4) Barring of the gate and possession. Asvatthaman's* entry into the camp is at first barred by images of
Krishna-Janardana*, which are dispelled by Asvatthaman's* homage to Siva* who, in turn, possesses
Asvatthaman* (10,7,65). These episodes are theological doublets, mythical reinforcements for what occurs
elsewhere on the plane of the epic narrative itself. Thus the dispelling of Krishna's images duplicates the absence of
Krishna. As Dumézil has pointed out,55 Siva's* possession of Asvatthaman* doubles the latter's identification with
Siva*, as Asvatthaman* was born a mixture "of Mahadeva* [Siva*] and Antaka ["Finisher"], of Krodha [Wrath]
and Kama* combined into a unity" (ekatvam upapannanam*; 1:61,66). Dumézil shows

shares appointed to them and their allies, see 5:56, 12-25; see also Biardeau's remarks on Dhrstadyumna-
Agni's* alliance with the Pandavas*, "Brahmanes* et potiers," p. 43, n. 2.

this conception of Asvatthaman * to have its closest analogue in a Bramanic* conception of Rudra.56
In view of these duplications, the two episodes cannot be expected to have exact counterparts in the Daksayajna*
myth, except where figures appear who similarly duplicate the roles of Visnu* (such as Dharma, who is the
dvarapala*, gate-keeper, who seeks and fails to prevent Virabhadra* from entering the sacrifice in Vam*. P. 4,23)
or of Siva* (Virabhadra* himself, like Asvatthaman* a "portion* of Rudra," in Bhag. P. 4,5,4).
(5) Entry. "As with Isvara* entering the camp of his foe, around Asvatthaman* on all sides rushed invisible beings
and Raksas*" (10:7,66), that is, Siva's* gana*. This could be an allusion to Siva's* entry of Daksa's* sacrifice
itself. Whether it is or is not, Asvatthaman* is aided not only by Siva's* gana*, but by Krpa* and
Krtavarmanincarnations of the Rudras and Maruts respectively. This may reflect an "early" form of the narrative in
which, without the gana*, representatives of Rudra's Vedic hosts, the Rudras and Maruts, would have aided
Asvatthaman* in his act of destruction. The gana* plays no role in what appear to be the earlier versions of the
"Daksayajna*" myth (Brahmanas*; Mbh. 10:18; 7:173,41-51).
(6) "Brutal" deaths. These next two episodes form the most crucial sequence of the night raid. Asvatthaman's*
activities occur in two neatly demarcated phases: in the first, ignoring the sword that Siva* has given him, he kills
his foes "brutally"; in the second, using the sword, he kills by performing symbolic mutilations.
This first phase recalls the telling of his plan to Krpa* and Krtavarman*, to whom he predicted: "Among the
Pancalas* I shall move about, slaying them now in battle like the enraged Rudra himself, Pinaka* [bow] in hand,
moving about among animals" (svayam* rudrah* pasusviva*; 10:3,19). As to his chief
56Ibid., p. 213; to create Rudra-Bhutavan* in order to avenge Prajapati's* incest against their sister Usas*,
the gods "put their most fearful bodies in one" (ghoratamastanva* . . . ekadha*; AB 3,33,I).

antagonist: "I will grind off [Pramathisyami *] Dhrstadyumna's* head like an animal's" (pasoriva*; 3,33). Having
entered the camp, he goes first to Dhrstadyumna's* tent and finds him sleeping in a luxurious bed. He kicks him to
wake him, seizes him by the hair (as Dhrstadyumna* had done to Asvatthaman's* father Drona*), and presses him
down to the ground.
Striking him with his foot on both his throat and chest [tamakramya* pada* . . . kanthe* corasi cobhayoh*]
while he was roaring and writhing [nadantam* visphurantam], he made him die the death of an animal
[pasumaramamarayat*]. Tearing at him with his nails, Dhrstadyumna*, not very clearly, said, "Slay me
with a weapon [sastrena*], do not delay; if you do this, I may go to well-made worlds [sukrtamllokan*]."
Having heard these indistinct sounds of his, Drona's* son said: "There are no worlds for slayers of their
preceptors; therefore you do not deserve to be slain with a weapon." . . . And the wrathful one struck him in
the vital parts [marmasu] with violent kicks of his heels." [8,18-21]
These blows bring on Dhrstadyumna's* death cries which awaken certain guards, whom Asvatthaman* slays with a
Rudra weapon. This first phase of butchery concludes with the deaths of two more Pancalas*, the shadowy but
strangely inseparable Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu, who also die crying out (vinardantam) and writhing like
animals (visphurantam* ca pasuvat*; 8,31-35). The text itself indicates that these "brutal" deaths, at least beyond
the particular case of Dhrstadyumna* (see also 5,33-34), are not brought about simply as devices to keep the
victims from reaching the heaven of heroes: "Having slain them, Asvatthaman* rushed here and there against the
maharathas* . . . ; trembling and quivering, they were slain [samita*; or: prepared as an oblation] like animals in a
sacrifice" (iva pasunmakhe*; 8,36).57
57 It is true that animals should be silent in a sacrifice, strangled without a sound; this seems to be one of
several indications that the Sauptikaparvan tells of a sacrifice gone out of control.

The epic also makes it clear that these slaughters portray Asvatthaman * in Siva's* ancient role of Pasupati*, "Lord
of Animals": "The wrathful one caused thousands of shrinking, shuddering men to fall, like Pasupati* among
pasus*" (8,122). But why are these animalian deaths singled out as so especially significant for Dhrstadyumna*
and the Pancalas*? In the Brahmanas* the name Pasupati* occurs frequently in connection with the "Daksayajna*"
myth and its "multiform,"58 the myth of Rudra's vengeance against Prajapati* for the latter's incest with Usas*. In
this second myth, Satapatha* Brahmana* 1,7,4,1 tells us that the gods called on Rudra as Pasupati* to avenge their
sister, and Aitareya Brahmana* 3,33 (in which the gods make Rudra of their most terrible forms; see n. 55) says
that it was as a reward for his service that Rudra claimed pasunamadhipatyam*, "sovereignty over animals." But
more interesting is Satapatha* 1,7,3 (see also TS 2,6,8,1-3), one of the earliest versions of the "Daksayajna*" itself.
Here, when Rudra has interrupted the gods' sacrifice to demand his share, the gods set up the practice of giving
him the last oblation under the euphemistic name of Agni Svistakrt*, "Agni the Maker of Good Offering."
Accordingly: "That [offering] then is certainly made to 'Agni.' His are these names: Sarva* as the eastern people
call him, Bhava, as the Bahikas* [call him]; Pasunam* Pati, Rudra, and Agni. The name Agni, doubtless, is the
most auspicious" (santa*; 1,7,3,8). On this passage, Biardeau's comments are helpful concerning "the identification
of Agni with Rudra Pasupati*: the sacrifice, which involves putting victimspasu*to death, has for this reason an
impure and dangerous aspect which must be abolished by an oblation to Rudra. It is in this that Rudra is 'master of
pasu*,' and it is also this which places him in relation to death and impurity."59 In these early versions of the
58 The term is used in a related way by O'Flaherty, "Origin of Heresy," P. 319; Prajapati* is "the sacrifice"
whom (which) Siva* attacks. Cf. SB* 1,7,3 and 4.

a sacrifice by placing the "mark

"Daksayajna *" myth Rudra's character as "Lord of Animals" involves his identification with Agni as "slayer of
animals." Under the "auspicious" name of Agni Svistakrt*, he takes his "remainder" share and permits the sacrifice
to be completed. But as Pasupati*, Sarva*, Bhava, and Rudra, he holds the threat of destruction.
In the Sauptikaparvan, Asvatthaman-Pasupati* has claimed his "share" of the "sacrifice of battle" by slaying
Dhrstadyumna*, none other than the incarnation of "the auspicious portion of Agni" himself. In some cases, most
clearly in that of Yudhisthira* and Salya*, it is evident that when a combatant slays his "share," some quality
which both opponents possess is enhanced in the victor at the expense of the vanquished.60 Such seems to be the
significance here. In slaying the incarnation of Agni, Asvatthaman*, as his very first act of destruction, eliminates
the "auspicious Agni" and takes on the character of "the fire at the end of the yuga" (yugante* . . . pavakah*;
10:8,137). Also, "desiring to please the son of Drona*, Krpa* and Krtavarman* set fire to the camp in three places"
(8,103)a transparent allusion to the three sacrificial fires (no doubt to be correlated with the three worlds) put to
inauspicious use.
If this interpretation is correct so far, a problem remains. The episode does not follow the usual schema of the
Daksayajna* myths, where Siva* obtains his share at the end of his destructive raid rather than at the beginning.
Actually, in all the versions of the Daksayajna* that I have examined, only in one case is there a parallel episode at
this point. According to the Linga* Purana*, the following is included among the mutilations inflicted by
Virabhadra*: "Having cut off the two hands of Vahni
(Footnote continued from previous page)
of an animal" (pasusamjnam*) on his royal victims (2:20,11); see also above, chapter 10, n. 60.
60 Salya* as a "share" symbolizes kingship, sovereignty, and the earth, the share which Krishna urges upon
Yudhisthira* (9:15,16-17); see above, Chapter, 10, following n. 45; see also Chapter 10, n. 80, on Bhisma* and
"Sveta*."'

[Agni] and having torn out his tongue in sport, the high-powered Virabhadra * kicked him in the head with his
foot" (jaghana* murdhni padena*; 69,16). Dhrstadyumna* was kicked in the chest and throat; both cases probably
indicate a crude symbolism of "putting out a fire." But there is no sense in the Linga* that in maiming Vahni,
Virabhadra* has obtained his or Siva's* share. Rather, epic and myth seem to diverge here. In the former,
Asvatthaman*, by slaying foes like pasu*, subsumes the "auspicious Agni" as his own share and takes on the
aspect of the inauspicious fire at the end of the yuga. In the myth, more optimistic, Rudra becomes the auspicious
fire (Svistakrt*) rather than the inauspicious (Pasupati*). This is what we may call the first "inversion" concerning
the matter of "shares" (see item 13 below).
(7) Symbolic mutilations. Having completed the first phase of the night raid, Asvatthaman* takes up his sword.
This instrument, turned against particular foes, is used with precision. First, he attacks the Draupadeyas,
Draupadi's* five sons by the Pandavas*. Yudhisthira's* son Prativindhya falls when struck "in the region of the
abdomen" (kuksidese*; 8,50); Bhima's* son Sutasoma's arm is cut off (bahum* chittva*; 8,52) and then he is slain
when pierced through the heart presumably from his unprotected side; Satanika*, Nakula's son, has his head cut off
(apaharacchirah*; 8,54); Srutakarman*, son of Sahadeva, is struck by the sword on his mouth (asye*) and falls,
his "mouth disfigured" (vikrtananah*; 8,56); and last, having let loose a brief volley of arrows to remind us of his
father, Arjuna's son Srutakirti* is decapitated, whereupon "his radiant head, adorned with earrings, fell from his
body" (8,58).
The Draupadeyas present no clear structure of their own,61 and while symbolic meaning is certainly present in
their disfigurations, the symbolism is borrowed from their fathers. In three instances the correlations are striking:
the son of

Bhima *, the mightiest and most "long-armed" of the Pandavas*, loses his arm; the son of Nakula, the most
beautiful Pandava*, loses his head; and the son of Sahadeva, noted for his eloquence and "sweet words," has his
mouth disfigured.62 Arjuna's handsomeness is also a subject of frequent praise, so it is fitting that his arrow-
shooting son should be decapitated. This leaves us in the dark only about Yudhisthira's* belly.63 But the real
question is why the poets have paused on this occasion to work out a tableau of mutilations for these pale and
poorly defined victims.64
The question, of course, comes back to the Pandavas* and the continuity of the Kuru line. With Abhimanyu slain
and with the pregnancy of his wife still unknown (Krishna has not divulged this information yet), the deaths of the
Draupadeyas symbolize not only the apparent extinction of the dynasty butwith the mutilationsthe fact that the ideal
image of sovereignty which the Pandavas* represent (here in face, mouth, arms, and belly) cannot be revived. As
to why the poets have found this a suitable occasion to display their ingenuity at the game of symbolism, one does
well to look to the Daksayajna*. The two sets of mutilations which concern different limbs and apparently
unrelated victims involve the same principle in different contexts. If one symbolism concerns the mutilation of
those limbs, destroyed by Asvatthaman*, which represent the effective continuity of the Kuru line, the other
concerns the mutilation of those limbs and organs, destroyed by Siva*, which represent the effective continuity of
the sacrifice. No one has
62 See, for example, 3:254,5-21, Draupadi* boasting about her husbands: Bhima* with "long arms as
developed as sala* trees" (9); Nakula "whose beauty [rupam*] is the utmost on earth" (14); and Sahadeva,
"of whom one finds no equal in wisdom and eloquence" (vakta*; 17).
63 But see GB 1,2 and TS 2,6,8,7 where the sacrifice is placed on the belly (jathara*) of Indra (GB) or
Brahman (TS), as these two are never harmed.
64 Only one other figure is multilated, the half-male, half-female Sikhandin*, fittingly shot between the eyes
and cut in two with the sword (8,59-60). One suspects several Siva* symbols here too.

appreciated the paradoxical character of the latter symbolism as well as Dumézil: "Bhaga, who distributes 'parts'
and who is blind, appears beside Savitr *, the 'Impeller,' who sets all things in motion and who has lost his two
hands; and also beside Pusan*, protector of the 'meat on foot' which are the herds, and who, having lost his teeth,
can eat only pap."65 From the Brahmanas* on to the Siva* and Bhagavata* Puranas*, for Daksa's* sacrifice to
continue it has been necessary that these limbs and organs be restoredeither directly, through Siva's* grace, to those
who have lost them (Mbh. 10:18,22; cf. Siva* P. 2,2,43,28), or indirectly, under the guidance of Brhaspati*
(Gopatha Br. 1, 2; SB* 1,7,4,13-15) or Siva* (Bhag*. P. 4,7,3), when these latter stipulate that the rite be handled
or continued with the eyes of Surya* (GB) or Mitra (Bhag*. P.), the arms of the Asvins*, the hands of Pusan*,
and the mouth of Agni (SB*) or the sacrificer's teeth (Bhag. P.).66
(8) Kalaratri*. The dying warriors now envision Kalaratri*, the black (kali*) Goddess Night of All-Destroying
Time (8,64-67). In some Daksayajna* myths, the goddess comes in her terrible Mahakali* or Bhadrakali* form to
do her part in the destruction (Mbh. 12:283,31 V; Vam*. P. 4,53-57; Siva* P. 2,2,33,11-12). Just as the myth can
do without the goddess in this role, so it is easy to imagine the Sauptikaparvan without this brief intrusion of
Kalaratri*.

shone forth in this human habitation like the fire at the end of the yuga, having turned all beings into ash" (yugante
* sarvabhutani* bhasma krtveva* pavakah*; 8,136); this is a free use of samdhya* ("twilight") and pralaya
imagery. Draupadi* then demands revenge against Asvatthaman*, and Bhima* sets out after him. He is soon
followed by his brothers and Krishna when the latter says that Bhima* will be unable to deal with Asvatthaman's*
weapons. Possible connections with the pralaya come to mindBhima-Vayu* as first to act in the "recreation";
Draupadi-Krsna-Sri* as the earth despoiled of "prosperity"67but I doubt that these correlations are any more than
coincidental. Draupadi's* wrath (she has just lost her sons and brothers) and her reliance on the strong-armed
Bhima* (cf. the Kicaka* story; 4:13-23) are easily explained as logical outcomes of the development of the plot.68
(11) Contest of the weapons. Taking off after Bhima* and Nakula, who is acting as Bhima's* charioteer, Krishna
and the rest of the Pandavas* catch up with them just as Bhima* is aiming his weapon. Meanwhile, Asvatthaman*
is sitting among a group of rsis* surrounding Vyasa* beside the Ganges. Seeing them, Asvatthaman* picks a blade
of grass, converts it into a Brahmasiras* ("Head of Brahma*") weapon capable of world destruction, and, "Filled
with wrath [rusa*], he uttered the terrible word 'apandavaya*' ['for the annihilation of the Pandavas*']. He then
released that weapon for the sake of the bewilderment of all worlds. Then in that blade of grass, a fire was
produced which seemed about to consume the three worlds" (10:13, 18-20). Immediately, Krishna urges Arjuna,
who alone can match Asvatthaman*, to counteract this weapon; and Arjuna releases his Brahmasiras* from his
bow, wishing only to "neutralize" or "appease" (samyatam*; 14,6) that of his opponent.
67 On Vayu*, see EMH, 2, p. 60; on Bhima* and Vayu*, see above, n. 38; on Draupadi* and the earth, see

Once released, it too "blazed up like the fire at the end of the yuga" (7). At this impasse, "desiring the welfare of all
creatures" (sarvabhutahitaisinau *; 13) as well as of the worlds (lokanam*; 15), the two munis Narada* and
Vyasa* take position (sthitau) between the two weapons to neutralize their energy. From this station they rebuke
the heroes for their rash act of releasing the deadly arms, thus setting up an interesting contrast between the two
combatants. To Arjuna is dedicated a long passage (15,1-10) praising the extraordinary ability possible only
through brahmacarya, truthfulness, and the observation of vowswhich allows him to withdraw the weapon.
Asvatthaman*, however, having released his weapon out of wrath and fear of Bhima*, tells the two rsis* that he is
unable to withdraw it (11). After further efforts have failed, Vyasa* can only convince him to relinquish his gem so
as to satisfy Draupadi*. The curse has been made.
Here the closest parallel is found in an unusual version of the Daksayajna*, although similar episodes are found in
other versions of the myth.69 Krishna is speaking, this time to Arjuna, telling him that when he, Arjuna, fought in
the battle it was Rudra, proceeding in front of him, who actually slew his foes (12:330,69). Most interesting,
however, is a description of what occurred after this same Rudra had finished his destruction of Daksa's* sacrifice.
His rage unspent, Rudra attacked the rsis* Nara and Narayana* (= Arjuna and Krishna) in their hermitage at
Badari. As they fight, the whole universe darkens, the Vedas are concealed from the rsis*, rajas and tamas pervade
the gods, the oceans dry up, the mountains crack, "and indeed Brahma* was shaken from his seat" (brahma*
caivasanaccyutah*; 54). "When such signs occurred, Brahma*, surrounded by the divine host and the high-souled
Rsis*, quickly came to the spot where the
69 Brahma* intercedes often and so, sometimes, do the Rsis* (Mbh. 7 :173,47); many versions also speak
of a conflict between Siva* and Visnu* after the sacrifice is destroyed, sometimes Visnu* prevailing (HV),
sometimes Siva* (Linga* P.).

battle was raging. Joining his hands in reverence, Brahma * addressed Rudra: 'May it be well [sivam*] for the
worlds; throw down your weapons for the sake of the welfare of the universe'" (55-56). His intercession works:
"Thus addressed by Brahma*, Rudra, casting off the fire of his wrath [krodhagnimutsrjan*], then caused the
powerful god Narayana* to be gratified. . .. And then that boon-granting god, whose wrath is conquered and whose
senses are conquered [jitakrodho jitendriyah*], became pleased there and was reconciled with Rudra" (61-62).
The contrast between the two gods is thus homologous to the contrast between Asvatthaman* and Arjuna. As
Asvatthaman* must discharge his weapon, Rudra must "cast off" the fire of his wrath;70 and as Arjuna (one with
Krishna) restrains his weapons, so Narayana* (one with Nara) has his wrath and senses under control. Moreover,
there are parallels in the roles of the intercessors. For the sake of the "welfare of the worlds" Brahma* on the one
hand and Vyasa* and Narada* on the other are roused from their "seats" to plead for a cessation of hostilities. A
variant of the crucial theme of the unleashing of Siva's* wrath (Mbh. 12:274,45-46) makes it clear that Brahma's*
bargain was no less costly to the world than the one struck by Vyasa* and Narada*. In the one case, the fever
(jvara) from Siva's* wrath will be dissipated among various minerals, animals, birds, and men, to afflict them,
especially the latter, at the times of birth and death. In the other, the detoured Brahmasiras* will wipe out the last
hope of the Kuru line.
(12) Promise of the "renaissance." Unable to withdraw his weapon, Asvatthaman* can only alter its course through
a reinterpretation of his curse's meaning: it will go into the wombs (garbhesu*; 15,31) of the Pandava* wives. The
Pandavas*
70 Cf. the Banasura* myth (HV 2,123,16-28) where after Siva's* jvara ("fever") and Krishna's jvara fight
to a standstill, it is agreed that Krishna will dissolve his into himself (mayyevaisa* praliyatam*; 18) while
Siva's* will be distributed among diseases and deserted things. The connection between the myths is noted
by Ruben, Krishna, pp. 196-97.

will thus be slain symbolically, with no hope of "rebirth." To console them, Krishna then commits "an imprudent
act."71 He tells them of Uttara's * pregnancy: being the wife of Abhimanyu and not of the Pandavas*, she will
escape the curse. But Asvatthaman* overhears and extends the weapon's effect to her. At this point Krishna must
promise to intercede. True, he says, the weapon will take effect and the child will be stillborn; but he, Krishna, will
give it life. There will be a renaissance after all.
This crucial episode has no true parallel in the "renaissance" of the Daksayajna* which, as we have seen, concerns
only the renewal of Daksa's* rite through the restoration of the mutilated limbs of the gods. One may accept
Biardeau's position that this event is cast in the imagery of the pralaya. But my next chapter will present an "older"
comparison that will rely not on common images but on similar narratives.
(13) Asvatthaman's* fate. In addition to his promise, Krishna curses the "child-slaying" Asvatthaman* to reap the
fruit of his acts in a terrible destiny:
For three thousand years you will wander over this earth without a companion and without being able to
talk to anyone. Alone and with no one by you, you will wander through deserted places [nirjanan* . . .
desan*]. O wretch [ksudra*], there will be no place for you in the midst of men. Stinking of pus and blood,
you will have your home in inaccessible wastelands [durgakantarasamsrayah*]. You will rove about, O
sinful soul, infested with all diseases. [16,9-12]
This is the point in the Daksayajna* myths where Siva* is given his share: certainly more a blessing than a curse.
This is the second "inversion" of the share (see above, item 6): where Siva* is blessed, Asvatthaman* is cursed.
Both inversions follow an intelligible pattern: positive and optimistic for the divine Siva*, who takes on the
character of the auspicious fire and is blessed; negative for the "human" Asvatthaman*, who

takes on the character of the inauspicious fire and is cursed. Nonetheless, a closer look shows that Siva's * share
expresses a similar outsiderhood: it is "the remainder [vastu*], that part of the sacrifice which [is left] after the
oblations have been made" (SB* 1,7,3,7; cf. Bhag*. P. 4,7,4: the ucchesanam*). Thus Dumézil can point to the
outsiderhood of Asvatthaman* as a feature shaped by the character of Siva*: "Such will be the destiny of
Asvatthaman*, wandering alone in the bush, as does the god Rudra whom he incorporates and who possesses
him."72
But if Asvatthaman* receives his "share" elsewhere and is cursed where Siva* obtains his, on another occasion in
the Brahmanas* Rudra receives a share that brings him even closer to Asvatthaman*. This is at the end of the
Sakamedhah*, the third of the three seasonal rites which marks the end of the rainy season. The rite concludes with
an offering to Rudra Tryambaka, and I include the pertinent passages from Satapatha* Brahmana* 2,6,2:
2. When he performs these offerings, he . . . delivers from Rudra's power both the descendents that are born
unto him and those that are unborn [re-emphasized, stanzas 3-4].
[5-9. Cakes are made and taken to Rudra's quarter, the north, and offered on a crossroad to Rudra and his
sister Ambika*:]
10. Now as to that additional [cake], he buries it in a mole-hill, with the text, "This is thy share, O Rudra!
The mole is thy animal [victim (pasu*)]." He thus assigns to him the mole as the only animal, and he
[Rudra] does not therefore injure any other animal. Then as to why he buries [the cake]: concealed, indeed,
are embryos [garbhas*], and concealed also is what is buried. By this [offering] he delivers from the power
of Rudra those descendents of his, that are not yet born.
[11-17. The sacrificial party now returns, having propitiated Rudra. Circumambulations are performed, and
then the sacrificer takes the remains of the cakes and fastens them to something high in the northerly
direction, saying:]

provisions people indeed set out on a journey: hence he thereby dismisses him supplied with provisions
whithersoever he is bound. Now in this case his journey is beyond the Mujavats!""with thy bow unstrung
and muffled up," whereby he means to say, "Depart propitious, not injuring us"; "Clad in a skin,"whereby
he lulls him to sleep; for while sleeping he injures no one' hence he says, "Clad in a skin."
This remarkable passage reads like a ritual text to the early "Daksayajna *" myths, or vice versa. But more, it
seems to provide a ground plan for some of the most prominent themes in the Sauptikaparvan: not just the "skin-
clad" exile beyond the mountains and the "muffling" of the weapon, but the matter of the "concealed embryos." As
A. B. Keith points out,73 the whole family participates symbolically in this rite, including the Pitrs* and the
unmarried women. It is but a short step to the destiny of the Kuru line: surely Krishna "delivers from the power of
Rudra those descendents of his [and of the Pandavas*], that are not yet born."
(14) Theological reflections. In almost every case, the Daksayajna* draws to a close by offering some sort of
theological key to the events that have transpired. And although sectarian interests sometimes prevail, beneath them
lies an emphasis on the complementarity of the two gods (see Mbh. 12:330,64-66; 12,284, 111-13V; Linga* P.
69,89; Siva* P. 2,2,43, 12-20). These reflections go back to the Brahmanas*, suggesting that even there the
"Daksayajna*" myth inspired such a view. After its version, Satapatha* 1,7,4 continues with directives on how the
Brahman priest, representing Brhaspati*, should handle the dangerous "foreportion" (prasitra*) which has become
Rudra's share. Having followed the careful ritual (9-16) and kept the "power of Rudra" (rudriyam) from the
sacrificer's cattle (pasu*),

he eats the prasitra * "with Agni's mouth" (15) and then rinses his mouth with water. Then he is brought his own
portion (brahmabhaga*): "Henceforth he watches what remains incomplete of the sacrifice" (asamsthitam*
yajnasya*; 18), and maintains silence:
19. Now the Brahman, assuredly, is the best physician; hence the Brahman thereby restores the sacrifice;
but if he were to sit down there talking, he would not restore it: he must therefore maintain silence.
20. If he should utter any human sound before that time, let him there and then mutter some Rc* or Yajus-
text addressed to Visnu*; for Visnu* is the sacrifice, so he thereby obtains a hold on the sacrifice: and this
is the expiation of that (breach of silence) [vai visnustadyajnam* punararabhate* tasyo haisa*
prayasittih*].
This passage, along with analogous ones, appeared in the last chapter's discussion of the expiatory role that is
shared by the Brahmanic* Visnu* and the epic Krishna. It now appears that this is a Brahmana* instance of
Visnu's* absolving function being available directly after the dangerous portion of the sacrifice, connected with
Rudra, has been neutralized by "fire" and water.
Similar theological keys to these are found in the Sauptikaparvan where, as we have seen, Krishna concludes the
narrative with an account to Yudhisthira* of the former deeds of Siva* (including the "Daksayajna*"). But this is
not the only place where there is a pause for such reflections. Earlier, as they are being slain, the Pandava*
warriors reflect: "The son of Drona* in anger could never perform such acts as these in battle; . . . surely through
the nonpresence [asamnidhyad*] of the Parthas* has our slaughter been achieved. There is no one able to defeat
the son of Kunti* whose protector [gopta*] is Janardana*" (10:8,115-17). And when the bereaved Kuru king
Dhrtarastra* asks why Asvatthaman*, so irresistible now, could not have prevented the slaughter of the Kauravas,
Samjaya* (who has been given the "divine eye" by Vyasa*) answers in much the

same terms: "Surely the son of Drona * was able to achieve this feat only through the nonpresence [asmnidhyad*]
of Prtha's* sons, as also of the insightful Krishna and Satyaki*" (8,146-47). We have already discussed the
background for this "non-presence." Let us now appreciate the symmetry in the theological reflections. In reciting
the former deeds of Mahadeva*, Krishna was responding to the same question from Yudhisthira* (17,2-6) as was
asked of Samjaya* by Dhrtarastra*. Where the Kuru king learned that Asvatthaman* could succeed only by
Krishna's absence, the Pandava* king learned that he could succeed only by Siva's* presence. This is the same
pattern, but this time much clearer, as in Siva's* potential "involvement" and Krishna's explicit "nonpresence"
(asamnidhyam*; 3:14,14) in the dice game74a confirmation also of Held's insight into the complementarity of the
dice game and the war.75
Thus close correspondences exist between the structure of the Daksayajna* and the intrigue of the Sauptikaparvan.
Other themes connected with the sacrifice also suggest that the epic narrative has been fashioned, once again, by
poets closely familiar with the ideology of the Brahmanas*. One might object, on the grounds that there is no
eschatology in the Brahmanas*, that this alignment of the Sauptikaparvan with the "Daksayajna*" has undermined
the whole notion of the eschatological character of the epic crises. Here Krishna's version of the "Daksayajna*"
meets such an objection: it took place, he says, "when a devayuga had passed" (devayuge 'tite; 10:18,1). This
could refer to the end of a Krta* yuga,76 or to the end of a mahayuga*, a full cycle of four ages; but the poets
have clearly perceived the eschatological potential of the "Daksayajna*" myth.77 In
74 See above, Chapter 4.
75 See Held, Ethnological Study, p. 304.
76 So Ganguli-Roy, Mahabharata, VII: Sauptika Parva, 42.
77 This epic treatment is in fact the only one I have found where the "Daksayajna*" occurs explicitly at the
end of a yuga; cf. Mbh. 12:283,1V: "in the period of Manu Vaivasvata." However, at one Sarasvati* tirtha*, "a
blessing was formerly uttered by Daksa* while he was sacrificing: 'Whoever

all the post-Brahmanic * texts there is a passage which expresses this potential unequivocally, but none more
forcefully than the one in the version with which Krishna concludes the Sauptikaparvan: "The goddess Earth
trembled and the mountains shook. The wind did not blow, nor did the fire, though kindled, blaze forth. And even
the constellations in the sky, agitated, wandered about. The sun did not shine, the lunar disc lost its sri*. All
confounded, space became covered with darkness [timerena*; cf. 7:173,46 and 13:145,15: tamasa*]. Then,
overcome, the gods did not know their domains [visayanna* prajajnire*], the yajna* did not shine forth, and the
Vedas abandoned them" (10:18,9cd-12).
Yet if the themes and frame of the Daksayajna* were found to be appropriate vehicles to carry along the narrative
of an eschatological crisis, the deeper question, raised by Dumézil, remains: is there an earlier, perhaps Indo-
European, eschatology which has been refashioned here in the matrix of the Brahmanic* sacrifice?
(Footnote continued from previous page)
dies here, these men shall be conquerors of heaven" (3:120,2); to which the Northern recension adds:
"There is also a marvelous thing which occurs in this region: whenever a yuga is waning, there is an
appearance of Sarva* [Siva*], assuming any shape at will, together with his companions and Uma*"
(3,639*).

Chapter 13
"Renaissance"
If an Indo-European interpretation of the epic's eschatological crisis is to be extended beyond the common but
general theme of a great battle, one must look elsewhere than at Yudhisthira's * dice play and his less than "idyllic"
postwar reign. To put it as cautiously as possible, two figures, Abhimanyu and Pariksit*, are brought into
surprisingly sharp relief when their story and characters are compared with the mythology of Baldr.1
First, Abhimanyu offers a more satisfactory definition of the "royal ideal" than Yudhisthira*. When Samjaya*
begins his account of how this heir of the Pandavas* died, he describes Abhimanyu as the epitome of the
omnivirtuous but essentially trifunctional royal ideal that was outlined in Chapters 7 and 8. In a lengthy but
beautiful eulogy (7:33,1-10), the first seven slokas* describe, in roughly trifunctional form, the virtues of Krishna,2
of each of the Pandavas*, and of all six together. Then it continues:
8. Those virtues flourishing in Krishna and those virtues in the Pandavas*that assemblage of virtues was
indeed found in Abhimanyu.
1 See above, Chapter 12, following n. 5.
2 Of Krishna it is said (sl*. 2): "In goodness [sattvam], deeds [karman], and lineage [anvaya]; in intelligence
[buddhi], character [prakrti*], fame [yasas*], and prosperity [sri*], there never was and never will be a man
having such virtues [gunas*] as Krsna*."

9. In firmness [dhairyam] he was the equal of Yudhisthira*, in conduct [caritam] of Krishna, and in deeds
[karman] of Bhima* of terrible deeds;
10. In beauty, strength, and learning [rupena* vikramena* srutena* ca] he was the equal of Arjuna, and in
modesty [vinaya] of Nakula and Sahadeva. [7:33,1-10]
Nowhere in the epic does a more ample treatment of the virtues retain an equally trifunctional outline. Moreover, it
is not only trifunctional in general but in particular: Arjuna, Abhimanyu's true father, is the only one to be
individually characterized by single virtues for each function: beauty, strength, and learning.
The significance of this endowment should be apparent. Both the core of virtues that he shares with Arjuna and the
full "assemblage of virtues" that he shares with the Pandavas* and Krishna have been lost to the Kuru line with
Abhimanyu's death. And who, "in reality," is Abhimanyu? In the dictionaries of incarnations he is described
variously as "the good Varcas [Splendor], the splendid son of Soma" (1:61,86), and as "Soma, who became
Subhadra's* son here having divided himself in two through yoga" (15:39,13). Soma here is certainly the moon,
although as I will try to show, certain resonances of the archaic double character of Soma as both sacrificial plant
and moon are detectable in Abhimanyu.3 Dumézil has called attention to the lunar phenomena that attend his birth,
and both Hopkins and Dumézil have recognized that the brief sixteen years of his life correspond to the days in the
light half of the lunar month (suklapaksa*).4
3 The age of this double character has long been debated, but it is at least as early as the late Vedas; see
most recently Jan Gonda, "Soma, Amrta* and the Moon," Change and Continuity in Indian Religion (The
Hague: Mouton, 1965), pp. 38-70.

Disappointingly, however, Dumézil refers to Abhimanyu's link with the moon as one of several divine-heroic
associations in the epic that "appear artificial and without consequence."5 This is an oversight. The dynasty whose
virtues and continuity Abhimanyu and his son represent is the "Lunar Dynasty" (candra vamsa *, soma vamsa*).
And the Vedic Soma whose Varcas he incarnates is a raja*, King Soma, as well.
Dumézil's first-function portrayal of the "ideal" Baldr was not entirely convincingBaldr does not remind one of
Aryaman or Mitra. But let us recall Snorri's description of his virtues: he is "the best of them . . . fair of face and
bright . . . you can tell how beautiful his body is, and how bright his hair [from the comparison of his brow to a
flower]. . .. He is the wisest of all the gods, and the sweetest spoken, and the most merciful."6 Compared with
Abhimanyu, Baldr shows the highest perfection on two levelswisdom (first function) and beauty (third)but no
warrior traits. This may suit Snorri's portrayal of Baldr as the innocent, unarmed victim in the missile-throwing
game, but it is not the complete picture that Norse traditions give of Baldr. His death in the Gylfaginning is brought
about by the fact that he is invulnerable to weapons. And, as several scholars have noticed, Saxo Grammaticus'
portrayal of Balderus in the Gesta Danorum,7 the use of his name in the formation of warrior kennings, and
perhaps also the meaning of his name,8 all present him with a martial side. Baldr quite plausibly becomes, like
Abhimanyu, an embodiment of the highest virtues of all the functions, not just a first-function figure.

7 Elton, Danish History, I. 177-90 (Book 3); of the two portrayals, Dumézil's "Balderus and Hotherus," Myth to
Fiction, pp. 171-92, is to me convincing in demonstrating the priority and reliability of Snorri.

Such similarities in the physical and moral descriptions of the two "youths"9and others may be cited10are not
significant by themselves. But if it can be shown that their biographies coincide on a number of major points, there
will be reason to regard these two omnivirtuous figures as representatives of a common and ancient eschatological
hope.
Jeu Truqué
First, a major focus of Dumézil's discussion was the comparison between the missile game in which Baldr dies and
the dice game which sends Yudhisthira * into exile. Certain differences, among them those varying fates of the two
"losers," have cast doubt on whether these two "fixed matches" really have much in common. But if the death of
Baldr compares poorly with the exile of Yudhisthira*, it holds surprising parallels with the death of Abhimanyu.
Arjuna's son has fought illustriously in the first eleven days of the war, but on the twelfth Drona* promises to take
his life. He stipulates that Arjuna must be detained elsewhere on the battlefield, and the Samsaptakas* (those
"sworn-together" never to flee from Arjuna) agree to keep him busy. With Arjuna out of the way, Drona*
commands his troops to form a "circular array" (cakravyuha*, var. padmavyuha*; 7:32,18, etc.). This singular
configuration is described (7:33,12-20) as a sort of mobile circle which can mount an attack, and which, though it
includes thousands of warriors, has certain key figures placed on the rim and in the center. When the Pandavas*
(minus Arjuna) find themselves unable
9 Whether plant or moon, Soma is a youth (yuvan) or child (sisu*; RV* 9,16,17). Also, Frigg did not pick
the mistletoe because it was "too young"; see above, Chapter 12, at n. 15.
10 "A splendor radiates" from Baldr; Abhimanyu "shines surpassingly" (atirocata; 6:69,29) while fighting.
Baldr's brow is like the ox-eye daisy; Abhimanyu's eyes are like Krishna's, that is, like the lotus (14:60,7-8;
7:50,30), and he has "beautiful brows" (subhru*; 7:55,33).

to break this circle, Yudhisthira * calls upon Abhimanyu, who tells him that Arjuna has indeed taught him the
technique of penetration. "But," he adds, "I shall not be able to come out again if any distress overtakes me"
(34,19). He is thus entering a sort of military maze.11 Bhima* then gives assurance that he will lead others into the
breach to protect Abhimanyu once he has broken through, and the latter sets off. He enters the circular array and
for some time gets the best of it; and at one point he performs a noteworthy trick of his father's: "Having
encompassed [kosthakikrtya*: "having made a wall around"] him with a host of chariots, collectively
[samghasah*] they released showers of different kinds of arrows at him. These he cut off in mid-air by means of
his own sharp shafts and then pierced his foes in return" (7:36,10). But while he is careening about displaying his
marvelous talents, Bhima* and the rest of his allies are barred from following him by Jayadratha who uses a boon
obtained from Siva* (who else?) allowing him to harm the Pandavas* by being able to check all of them "except
Arjuna" (rte*'rjunah*; 3:256,28) once on the field of battle. The pattern that develops is then made clear (7:46,4-
5). Jayadratha keeps back Abhimanyu's rescuers from a mobile position outside the circle, closing its gaps
wherever necessary. At the same time, Abhimanyu is encircled by six of the foremost Kuru warriors, five of whom
incarnate Vedic divinities: Drona* (Brhaspati*), Krpa* (the Rudras), Karna* (Surya*), Asvatthaman* (Mahadeva*
[Rudra]-Antaka-Krodha-Kama*), and Krtavarman* (the Maruts). The sixth
11 Both cakravyuha* and padmavyuha* can designate a maze. Kinjawadekar, ed., Shriman
Mahabharatam*, IV: Dronaparvan* (Poona: Chitrashala Press, 1931), facing p. 55, so interprets the former
term, showing the diagram of a circular maze with a Nandi* and Lingam* in the center, with the Sanskrit
caption that it is a "picture of a cakravyuha* well known in Maharashtra.... The right or wrong direction is
to be determined by those of good understanding." V. R. Ragam, Pilgrim's Travel Guide, pt. II: North India
with Himalayan Regions (Guntur: Sri Sita Rama Nama Sankirtana Sangham, 1963), p. 175, cites a "Padma-
Vyuha" at Porbandar, Gujerat, which "pilgrims enter ... and after going round in it they finally manage to
come out with great difficulty."

and least significant is Brhadbala *, whom Abhimanyu kills in a last blaze of glory (46,22); but his position is
filled by an apparently unnamed son of Duhsasana* (oldest of Duryodhana's ninety-nine brothers). Drona* marvels
at the prowess of this kumara*, boy, "whose opening [flaw, loophole] the furious maharathas* do not see"
(antaram . . . na pasyanti*; 47,22), and reveals how he may be taken. By well-placed shots, Abhimanyu can be
deprived, piece by piece, of all his equipment. The six warriors then cut away his armor and weapons and, after a
brief flourish in which Abhimanyu courses through the air like Garuda* (47,35) and reminds everyone of Krishna
by holding up a chariot wheel (47,39-48,1), he is reduced to his last weapon, the mace. With this he engages in a
final duel with Duhsasana's* son. They knock each other to the ground; and then, "having risen up first, the son of
Duhsasana*, that increaser of the fame of the Kurus, struck Subhadra's* son on the head with his mace"
(gadaya*murdhnyatadayat*; 48,12).
The role of Drona-Brhaspati* in seeing to all the details of this slaying, the participation of all the figures on the
Kuru side who incarnate Vedic divinities, the use of the mace on the "head" all allow one to interpret Abhimanyu-
Soma's death within the context of the ritual pounding of the Soma.12 The six warriors who surround him may not
find exact counterparts in the Soma rite,13 but on other levels parallels are striking. As Bhima* was to be
Abhimanyu's protector, Bhima's* father Vayu* was the Vedic "protector of Soma" (RV* 10,85,5; and see notes 9
and 12). Yet even this may just be an Indian rehandling, perhaps quite early, of a more ancient drama.
12 On Soma's head (murdhan*) in the RV*, see R. Gordon Wasson, Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immorality
(The Hague: Mouton, 1968), pp. 45-46, especially RV* 9,27,3: "This bull, heaven's head, Soma, when
pressed is escorted by masterly men [nrbhir*] into the vessels."
13 But see Keith, Philosophy of the Veda, I, 326: In the Soma sacrifice, "the earth thrown up from the pit (of
the four sounding holes) serves to make six fire hearths or Dhisnyas*, which extend from north to south, and
are appropriated to" various priests.

Baldr is also slain when encircled. Like Abhimanyu he is surrounded by gods (whom Snorri refers to
euhemeristically as men).14 Strangely, too, the figures who make the two slayings possible, and against whom
vengeance is takenHodr and Jayadrathaboth stand outside the circle.15 In one case, the figure who represents the
plant of immortality (Soma) is slain, while in the other his counterpart is slain with the plant of immortality
(mistletoe).
These analogies, and this one striking inversion, seem stable enough that certain differences can be seen as
divergences. Clearly the most apparent is that Abhimanyu is slain while the great battle is in progress, whereas
Baldr's death is an important foreshadowing of the Ragnarök. Here Saxo's version is of interest, for he places
Balderus' (Baldr's) conflict with Hotherus (Hodr) in the context of a strange battle probably, as. Dumézil says, a
transposition of the Ragnarök itselfin which Hotherus defeats the euhemerized gods, who side with Balderus, by
cutting off the tip of Thor's club (that is, his hammer).16 Here too a parallel emerges, for just as Thor, Balderus'
second-function protector, is rendered inoperative, so is Bhima * kept from helping Abhimanyu by Jayadratha. The
upshot of these remarks is that the tradition which Snorri represents, which, as we have seen, "pacified" its ideal
figure by recording only his first- and third-function virtues, may have idealized him further, dreams and all,17
14 See above, cited Chapter 12, at n. 16.
15 There is no encirclement in Saxo's version, although Dumézil, Myth to Fiction, pp. 180-83, shows that
Baldr's invulnerability and the theme of "inoffensive bombardment" are probably transferred to Hotherus
(Hodr). However, both Hotherus and Jayadratha must endure penances in the wilds to receive the divine favor
that will enable them to slay their foes: Hotherus from certain forest virgins (Dumézil, Myth to Fiction, p. 190:
"a cross between the Norns and the Valkyries"; see Elton, Danish History, I, 188), Jayadratha from Siva* (see
above).
16 See Elton, Danish History, I, 184, and Dumézil, Myth to Fiction, pp. 165-66 (on Thor's club as his hammer)
and 191 (on Saxo's theomachia and the Ragnarök).

account, see Elton, Danish History, I, 186.

out of the scene of battle. One might think of Baldr's death as having taken place originally within the framework
of the battle of the Ragnarök, toward its beginning, like the death of Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata *. In each
case, a youth is the first to die of the divine company,18 and to die, moreover, at the latter's hands.
A second difficulty with these comparisons is that unlike Baldr, Abhimanyu does not appear to die in a rigged
game, a jeu truqué. The parallels that Dumézil cites elsewhere for Baldr's death make it unlikely that Snorri's
tradition has innovated here.19 Yet the encirclement of Abhimanyu has a certain gamelike quality. He knows the
way into the "maze," but not the way out. As cited above,20 when he is in the "circle-array" he is able effortlessly
to turn aside weapons in mid-air. And on two additional occasions leading up to his last fight, he is encircled in
arrays which clearly foreshadow Drona's* cakravyuha*: each time, fighting fearlessly and with easeand aided by
Arjunahe emerges unscathed.21 Thus, like Baldr, he is involved in a sort of game,22 each one to a certain extent
invulnerable in his circle, each able to make weapons turn aside in mid-air. He has far more invulnerability than
Yudhisthira* does when the latter enters the game of dice.
18 Abhimanyu does die on the twelfth day of the eighteen-day war, but up to then, of the major heroes,
only Bhisma* has been "slain," and he is not really slain.

Lamentation
If Baldr's death brings weeping from all and everything but Thokk, Abhimanyu is incontestably the most wept-for
figure in the Mahabharata *. Arjuna's long lament (7:50,19-60) mentions over and over, as if in a refrain, how
Abhimanyu was loved by others: by Subhadra*, by Krishna, by Draupadi*, by Kunti*, and by Pradyumna (25-29
and notes). He says: "If I do not see my son, I will go to the abode of Yama" (27 and 32). This parallels Baldr's
brother Hermod's descent to Hel to see if Baldr can be brought back. Abhimanyu is also deeply mourned by
Vasudeva, father of Krishna and Subhadra* (14:59,4-8). And two descriptions are given of Subhadra's* touching
lament. In the first (7:55), she, too, says she will go to Yama's abode (10), and then in a sequence that begins with
a reinforcement of Abhimanyu's trifunctional character, she prays that her son may obtain the end of all those who
have led good lives in the three functional zones23 and other widely varying capacities as well (munis, good kings,
good hosts, good wives, good husbands; 23bc-31). In the second account (14:60,24-29), Krishna tells how she ran
wailing like a female osprey from Kunti* to Uttara*, asking where Abhimanyu had gone and imploring Uttara* to
tell her when he returned. She leads the weeping, then, as did Frigg.
It is my impression that such lamentations over death, and the ritualized themes they might imply, are unusual in
Hindu India.24 The analogues with Baldr, and with the slain or

are grateful, liberal, and attend their gurus; of those who have given thousands of daksintas*; (2) may you
go the way of those heroes who never turn back while fighting, of those who have fallen in battle after
having slain their foes; (3) of those who give away thousands of cattle, who give in sacrifices."

"martyred" youths of other Indo-European traditions,25 are thus all the more striking, even considering the
typically Indian handling of the events.
"Nonresurrection"
Several scholars have spoken of the "nonresurrection" of Baldr and the fact that the true lesson of his death is that,
as Thokk says, Hel will "hold what she has." Edgar Polomé in particular has given an attractive reading of this
episode. Arguing that Snorri merely guesses that Thokk is Loki and that she is actually Hel herself, he says: "Her
very words give us a better idea of the real meaning of the Baldr myth: through his death, Baldr has entered the
land of no return. There is no question of resurrection. The core of the theme of Hermodr's descent to Hel is
accordingly the same as that of the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh or the Greek myth of Orpheus: no one can
escape death."26 I cannot agree with Polomé's interpretation of Baldr's death,27 as he ignores the question of
Baldr's return, but I am interested in his idea that Baldr's disappearance holds a profound lesson about the finality
of death. Both Baldr and Abhimanyu hold a close rapport with a plant of immortality: Baldr is slain by the
mistletoe,

Abhimanyu is slain like the Soma. In each case their connections with the plants of immortality hold a lesson about
death that can be read on either the human or the divine plane: both die prematurely, and both are the first to die of
their illustrious companythat of the gods, or that of the gods in human form (see n. 18). Their deaths foreshadow
doom and destruction.
But these are just the general lessons to be drawn from the two youthful deaths. Just as the Scandinavian tradition
seems to have lent gravity to the scene by deepening it with Thokk's riddles on the themes of immortality, death,
and non-resurrection, so the Indian tradition has paused to reflect on the very same matters. In a lengthy passage
which the Critical Edition, on questionable grounds,28 relegates to an appendix, Vyasa * makes one of his sudden
appearances. Before Arjuna returns to camp to learn of Abhimanyu's death, Vyasa* seeks to console Yudhisthira*.
Once again the epic presents a significant juxtaposition of the main heroic narrative with traditional myths and
legends. Here, basically two stories are involved. First, Vyasa* tells Yudhisthira* about a king who, having lost his
son, learned from the rsi* Narada* about the origin of death (Mrtyu*), the reluctant Dark Red Lady
28 These stories appear in all but the Sarada* and Kasmiri* manuscripts, which have conceivably rejected
them on the same grounds as the CE editor, S. K. De: that they interrupt the flow of the narrative. I am also
not convinced by V. S. Sukthankar's implication, "Epic Studies, VI, The Bhrgus and the Bharata: A Text-
Historical Study," in P. A. Gode, ed., V. S. Sukthankar Memorial Edition, I: Critical Studies in the
Mahabharata* (Bombay: Karnatak, 1944), 309-10, that because the brahmin Bhargava* Rama* is included
among the sixteen kings in the Dronaparvan* but not in the Santiparvan* version (which the CE retains at
12:29-31; 248-50), that the whole Dronaparvan* passage is a Bhargava* interpolation. There is no reason
why the Mrtyu* story should be part of a Bhargava* insert; if the Bhargava* redactors have tampered with
the text, it can only be on the matter of making Bhargava* Rama* the sixteenth "king." Moreover, there are
details in the Suvarnasthivin* story that point to the Dronaparvan's*as the more basic (or at least coherent)
account: see the clumsy role given Indra in the Santiparvan* (12:31,17), and the slaying of the boy by a
vajra-turned-tiger rather than by robbers (31,27-34).

(Dronaparvan *, Appendix I, No. 8, lines 118-19) whose tears, shed at the thought of killing creatures, ultimately
became their diseases at Brahma's* will (11. 208-25). This feminine personification of Death, who appears where
one might expect Yama, thus brings to mind Polomé's remarks about Thokk and Hel: in the Hindu account, even
Death's tears cannot prevent death; in the Norse, "Thokk will weep dry tears for Baldr." This could point back to a
common tradition, or it could be no more than a fantastic coincidence, each episode provoking similar meditations
on weeping and death. If it is a coincidence, however, it is not the only one. The Indian meditation also takes up
the theme of nonresurrection.
Vyasa's* second story concerns a king named Srnjaya* who obtains a boon from the rsis* Parvata and Narada*
and asks for a son of the following description: "Endowed with virtues [gunanvitam*], a possessor of yasas* and
kirti* [fame and glory: two second-function virtues], of tejas ["spiritual majesty"], a tamer of foes whose urine,
excrement, phlegm, and sweat shall all become gold" (Il. 305-7). There is good reason, as we shall see, to regard
this story as a parable concerning a trifunctional endowment of virtues, with the third function filled by this
Midaslike capacity to produce excessive and dangerous wealth (dhanam; 1. 309). The boy is given the name
Suvarnasthivin*, "Gold-Spitter," and soon his father has everything around him fashioned from gold. But one day
the boy is abducted by greedy robbers who chop him up and, finding no gold, then hack each other to bits (Il. 315-
26). When Srnjaya* sees his son slain, his lament brings consolation from Narada* in the form of the longer of the
two versions of the Sodasarajakiya*, "The Story of the Sixteen Kings" (Il. 327-872), biographical sketches of
famous figures of legend. Each vignette yields the moral that grief is unsuitable for such a child when greater men
by far have died. When Narada* has finished, he asks Srnjaya* whether his grief is gone, and, when he learns that
it has, he favors the king with the

resurrection of his son: "I give you back your son, wantonly slain by robbers like an unconsecrated sacrificial
animal [pasumaproksitarn *], raising him up from a noxious hell" (Il. 877-78). And the child appears. Now comes
the Indian meditation on the matter at hand: why could this fantastic lad be resurrected while Abhimanyu cannot?
Vyasa* shows that this has been the central question all along (functional traits numbered in parentheses):
(2) Unpracticed at arms, timid, slain without having donned his armor, (1) not having sacrificed, and (3)
childless, this one [Suvarnasthivin*] has thus returned to life. (2) Heroic, brave, and practiced at arms,
having churned up foes by the thousands, Abhimanyu has gone to heaven, slain while facing into battle.
Your son has gone to those imperishable regions that are obtained by (1) brahmacarya, wisdom, learning,
and desirable sacrifices.... Therefore, not reaching out to possess anything [any new virtues], surely it is not
possible to bring back the son of Arjuna, slain in battle and gone to heaven. [ll. 893-902]
Abhimanyu's place in heaven is thus, like Yayati's* and Duryodhana's,29 secured by a full trifunctional
complement of virtues. It can, of course, be no accident that all three are Lunar Dynasty kings. Moreover, this is
the third time that we have noticed a trifunctional endowment in Abhimanyu.30 In contrast, Suvarnasthivin* has
fulfilled none of the virtues his father bargained for and can thus return to earth, resurrected. The explanation for
the nonresurrection of Abhimanyu is thus typically Indian, although "early" in the sense that its concern for heaven
(svarga) contradicts the law of karman. But one important, indeed prophetic matter stands out in Vyasa's*
comparison of the two youths. Abhimanyu has clearly fulfilled himself in the second- and first-function virtues

which are juxtaposed so neatly in the passage just cited. But a third-function quality, perhaps rare but clear,31
stands out in its solitude: Suvarnasthivin * left the world unarmed, unfulfilled as a sacrificer, and childless;
Abhimanyu left the world armed and fulfilled at sacrifices. What about the child?
The Matter of the Embryo: "Renaissance"
Baldr's reappearance as ruler of the renewed world is a miracle. And although the secret which Odinn murmurs in
his ear before he is placed on the funeral pyre (Vafthrudnismal, stanzas 54-55) is a mystery, it seems to presage his
rebirth in this "other world."32 Only slightly less a mystery than the All-Father's words are the machinations of
Krishna in reviving the stillborn child of Abhimanyu. The miracle is achieved by the Indian "All-God" by a method
totally consonant with the prophetic hints of Krsna* Dvaipayana*. In the passage cited earlier, in which Subhadra*
implores her brother to keep his word and revive the baby like the three worlds,33 she prefaces her plea with a
eulogy: "Surely, O Kesava*, you have a soul of dharma [dharmatma*], are truthful [satyavan*], and have true
valor [satyavikramah*]. It behooves you to make this
31 See Chapter 9, at n. 26, where Yudhisthira*, after claiming responsibility for the deaths of Bhisma* and
Drona* (first-function sins) and Karna* (second-function), admits to the third-function sin of "lineage
destruction" for causing the "youthful" Abhimanyu's death, a sin like that of "slaying an embryo" (12:27,3
and 19-20). As we saw in Chapter 8 the notion of continuity of the family (kulam) sometimes falls into
place in lists of royal virtues as a virtue of the third function: see 8:5,27 (Yayati*) and 9:5,18 (Salya*); also
a similar usage of the "virtue" arya* at 5:39,50; cf. also 1:103,11: Gandhari* permitted to marry
Dhrtarastra* because of his "lineage, fame, and conduct" (kulam*khyatim*ca vrttam*)perhaps also
trifunctional.
32 See Dumézil, "Balderiana minora," pt. 1, p. 67, saying that Odinn's whispered words probably concern the
impossibility of present efforts to bring him back and his eventual destiny as Odinn's own successor. See also
Polomé, "Indo-European Component," p. 81, n. 72, citing pertinent bibliography: one must, however,
appreciate the multivalence of this theme: "initiation" and eschatology are not mutually exclusive.

word conform to truth" (tam *vacamrtam*; 14:66,16). As we saw in Chapter 8, she thereby calls attention to a
definite set of qualities: two from the first function (dharma, satya) and one from the second (vikrama); and it is
this very set which Krishna puts into effectby attesting to it three times in successionwhen he chants the dead baby
back to life. Here the passage, which appears in full in Chapter 8,34 is condensed to the essentials:
18 I do not speak falsely, it shall be true . . .
19 I have never turned back in battle . . .
20 Dharma and brahmins are dear to me . . .
21 I have never brought about hostility with Vijaya [Arjuna] . . .
22 Satya and dharma are ever established in me . . .
23 Kamsa* and Kesin* were righteously slain by me . . . [14:68]
The cadence is heightened by the repetition in each sloka* of one of the following phrases, or their equivalents:
"accordingly, let this child live"; and "by that truth [tena satyena] may this child live." The latter, as we saw .in
Chapter 8, is an "act of truth" formula,35 and I can now answer the question raised there. Though this formula
concerns only Krishna's second-function traits directly (it is used only in slokas* 21 and 23), it activates an "act of
truth" that concernsas seemingly it must to alter a royal destiny36virtues or achievements from each of the three
functions. For this is the final effect of Krishna's words: "When these words were uttered by Vasudeva*, the child,
O bull among men, softly, softly, O great king, quivered, now having sentience"
(sanaih*sanairmaharaja*praspandata sacetanah*; 24).

truth."

Narada* which makes it possible for Suvarnasthivin* to be resurrected.

Abhimanyu has thus entered heaven not only with his first- and second-function achievements, but, thanks to
Krishna, with a child now living on earth. But can the miracle of the Indian "renaissance" be paired with the return
of Baldr? Pariksit * is not, after all, Abhimanyu. Here, in my opinion, is where myth and epic diverge in easily
intelligible patterns. Baldr is a god living and dying in the divine time of myth; the ideal which he personifies can
thus move from the not-so-golden age of the past to the eschatological hope of the future. Abhimanyu dies and
Pariksit* lives in the heroic time of dynastic legend: the ideal they personify is thus restricted to human time, to a
single turning of the ages, here of the relatively recent (in Indian terms) past. But because of that event which
closes the "heroic age," our age, the dismal Kali yuga, is still, thanks to Krishna, begun with a line of kings
descended from Pariksit*the so-called Lunar Dynastyin which the ideal represented by Abhimanyu is still intact.
As an embryo, Pariksit* "began to grow in the womb [of Uttara*] like the moon in the light half of the month"
(suklapakse*yatha*sasi*; 14:61,17). And: "Very handsome, he was unto all creatures like a second Soma; . . .
Prosperous, truth-speaking, of firm fortitude [srimansatyavag-drdhavikrama*37], . . . beloved of Govinda; . . .
born in Uttara's* womb when the Kuru family was almost extinct [pariksina*]; . . . [Pariksit*] was skilled in
rajadharma* and artha, a king endowed with every virtue" (yuktah*sarvagunairnrpah*; 1:45,10-14). This is the
"renaissance" of the Lunar Dynasty, the Soma Vamsa*, from the last yuga into our present one.
Finally, the parallel between Baldr and Abhimanyu is more than a matter of two youths whose affiliation with
plants of immortality holds a lesson about death, or even about death and rebirth. Surely it is the greatest tragedy
that the youngest should die first. This youth represents a
37 See above, Chapter 8, above n. 40, interpreted trifunctionally.

"thwarted ideal" in a most specific sensean unused potential, a trifunctional potential placed on reserve in an
eschatological hope for the return of the completely endowed king. In this respect, these unfulfilled youths are the
male counterparts of the various virgins who, as Dumézil has so convincingly shown, service the king in numerous
Indo-European traditions (myths, legends, rituals) by holding in reserve the essences of the three functions.38 One
indication of a common store of ideas is that a term which the Mahabharata * uses for its two virgin rescuers of
royal linesMadhavi* and Draupadi*finds a close analogue in a description of Abhimanyu. Whereas Madhavi* and
Draupadi* are each described as sarvadharmopacayini*, "a promptress of every virtue,"39 Abhimanyu, as stated in
Samjaya's* eulogy of him at his death, has gunasamcayah*, "assemblages" or "accumulations of virtues" which he
shares with, or rather by which he surpasses, the trifunctionally described Arjuna, the Pandavas*, and the
omnivirtuous Krishna. Moreover, it is Krishna who makes the transfer of virtues possible. As I suggested in
Chapter 8, Krishna, at one point, is Draupadi's* Galava*: each of these two male figures can facilitate the transfer
of a feminine personification of sovereignty and, in the process, of sovereignty's virtues.40 This is also, in effect,
true in the present episode. It is through Krishna that the miracle of the rebirth of the Kuru line, with "all the
virtues" intact, takes place. Indeed, the text seems to build a symbolic identity between Krishna and Abhimanyu
that makes Krishna's intermediary role, as "reactivator" of the virtues, intelligible. As we have seen, Krishna and
Abhimanyu have identical eyes (see n. 10) and identical virtues (7:32,2 and 8; see also 1:213,70); and
Abhimanyu's last weapon, with which he goes down fighting, is a cakra. The significance of Krishna's constant
solicitations

of his cherished nephew during the latter's birth, marriage, and training in weapons becomes clear.41
These completely endowed youths, Abhimanyu and Baldr, thus act as repositories of royal virtues which, through
the agency of Krishna in one case and of Odinn in the other, are carried into a future age. Here, however, there is a
disjunction: the hope for their returns hinges on different "unfulfilled" virtues. In the Norse myths we are carried
into the future by a first-function virtue, Baldr's unrealized judgments, while in India this is achieved by a third-
function virtue, a child to continue the lineage. Presumably it is morealthough this is fundamentalthan just a case
of theology (or myth) on the one hand and epic (with mortal heroes) on the other. In Scandinavia, as Dumézil has
pointed out, the ideal of an empowered judge, righteous and impartial, is a theme that runs through several myths
and symbols;42 and in India, especially in the India of the Mahabharata *, what theme could be more far-reaching
than the duty to have a son?

Conclusions
If doubts have been aired about some of Dumézil's comparisons of Norse mythology and the Mahabharata *, and
if more reliable connections have been observed between the epic's crisis and the ideology of the Brahmanas*, the
Norse myth of the Ragnarök has still proved a suggestive counterpart to a central Mahabharata* sequence.
Beneath the modeling of the Sauptikaparvan on the Brahmanic* sacrifice lies that of the death and rebirth of the
Soma Vamsa's* ideal ruler on the Soma sacrifice. And beneath or beyond both of these, the full structure of an
Indo-European eschatological myth emerges, once again involving a jeu truqué, a great battle, and a renaissance.
Accordingly, one can still quote Dumézil about the possibility of such a myth: "That this conception appears
neither in the Rg*Veda nor in all that depends directly upon it does not prove that it did not exist. The thought of
the Vedic singers is concentrated on the present, on the regular attendance of the gods, for which the exploits of the
mythic past serve as the guarantees: the horizons of the future did not interest them."1 Moreover, Dumézil's more
recent work changes the picture on the roles of Krishna and Siva* in such a myth. His study of the
Mahabharata's* Sisupa1a* legend throws light on an archaic, perhaps para-Vedic, opposition of com-plementarity
between Visnu* and Rudra.2 He thus no longer

coins the terms "dieux clairs" for the former pair, "dieux sombres" for the latter. However, three affinities occur

seems so ready to reduce Visnu * and Siva's* double epic appearanceswhich we have noticed on a number of
occasions3 to recent adaptations.
These reflections, by way of conclusion, lead to a point concerning Indian theologythe age of this relationship
between Visnu* and Rudra is uncertain,4 but it is most likely at least Brahmanic*.5 Thus interpretations which
introduce the notion of sectarianism into the early relations between these gods are inadequate. It is probably
erroneous to think of the Daksayajna* as a sectarian myth,6 or even (in a historical sense) as a myth that
"represents [Siva's*] assimilation into the orthodox pantheon."7 Likewise, one must discard the traditional view of
the Mahabharata* as a Vaisnavite* or Krishnaite sectarian poem with Saivite* sectarian interpolations. To be sure,
interpolations abound, some of them sectarian, but the prevailing mood of the epic has nothing to do with sects.8
The Mahabharata* is a poem where "all the gods" are active

between Krishna and Odinn, all involving great battles: see Chapters 5 and 12. One wonders whether,
through these comparisons with Krishna, we have begun to integrate disparate elements in the mythology of
Odinn.

4 See Gonda, Visnuism*and Sivaism*, p. 87: though the two gods "maintained no direct relationship with each
other" in the Veda, he points to two RV* verses (7,40,5 and 4,3,7) which may, depending on uncertain
readings, point to some relation and even opposition. See Karl Friedrich Geldner, trans., Der Rig-Veda,
Harvard Oriental Series, vols. XXXIII-XXXV (3 vols.; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1951), I, 420,
speaking, in his note to 4,3,7, of "the opposition between Visnu* and Rudra as the procreator (Erzeuger) and
the destroyer" (my translation), the former apparently connected with Pusan* and the seed (rétas), the latter
with Agni and a firm missile weapon.

sects" (my translation).

in human form, with Visnu *incarnate in Krishnaat their head, or at their "center," while Siva* remains typically
remote until the moment when he must, after all, get his share and do his work. The relationship between Visnu*
and Siva* is thus situated within, or "above," the structure(s) of polytheism.9 Moreover, their relations to the
polytheistic gods are central in the epic crisis, just as they are in the Daksayajna* myth. In one case, Krishna
presides over the "sacrifice of battle," then absents himself for Asvatthaman*. In the other, Visnu* "is the
sacrifice," yet he is never there when Siva* gets his remainder share. No doubt many formulas could express the
multivalent polarity of the two gods,10 but the lesson here seems well expressed by the opposition: "Pervader"
(Visnu*vis*-?) and "Outsider" (Rudrarudis, Latin, "rough, raw, rude, unwrought, uncultivated").11 Whatever one
may think of these far-flung etymologies, they refer to an intriguing paradox: what possible relation, what
underlying unity, can exist between the Outsider and the Pervader?
As to the matter of Indian polytheism, the epic must be appreciated in its correlation with a whole mythology, a
mythology, moreover, with an Indo-European past. Yet there is a point where I would disagree with Dumézil over
the nature of the relation between myth and epic in the Mahabharata*. First, with regard to the question of
individual transpositions, Dumézil speaks of a "veritable pantheon" which has been transposed into "human
personages by an operation as meticulous as it was ingenious."12 These transpositions

Visnu* overflowing them (as from within?), Rudra avoiding them (as from without?).

attest to "an 'author's' will,13 and the poets themselves emerge as "erudite, skillful, loyal to a design,"14 perhaps an
academy of priests or several generations of a single school who would have composed the work "before writing,
at the time of the four Vedas and of the fifth."15 All this makes it possible for Dumézil to speak of the heroes as
inflexible "copies" of their mythical prototypes.16 To me, this seems too mechanical and too short-term a process.
It says nothing about certain "difficult" transpositions in which the heroes' and heroines' characters and actions
differ markedly from what one knows of their mythic counterparts, and it does not account for actions and themes
that lack mythic prototypes.
Second, as we saw in Chapter 12, Dumézil regards certain basic moments in the unfolding of the epic crisis as
transpositions of an ancient Indo-European eschatological myth, presumably still known at the time of the poem's
composition. Thus the epic story, in these essential features, is a "myth learnedly humanized if not historicized."17
However, in favorably discussing Wikander's treatment of the battles of Brávellir and Kuruksetra *, Dumézil is
forced to make an unconvincing distinction. It is not necessary, he says, to interpret the Battle of Brávellir, "like
the Mahabharata*," by a historicized eschatological myth; for whereas the crisis in the Mahabharata* bears a
striking resemblance to that in the myth of the Ragnarök, the Battle of Brávellirparticularly in the role of
Odinndoes not.18 Thus, despite the affinities (which Dumézil recognizes) between the Mahabharata* and the
Battle

of Brávellir, affinities which concern epic material, he sees the most basic features of the Indian epic story in terms
of transpositions from myth.
The question thus is: can one speak of the basic outline of the Mahabharata * as presenting a distinct epic crisis?
Or must one explain the crisis solely in terms of some prior myth? In my view, the evidence presented by
Wikander and others19 is strong enough to suggest that the Indo-Europeans knew a story, in certain basic details
like the Mahabharata* about a dynastic struggle which brought to an end their "heroic age." This story itself would
seem to have told of an epic crisis of what could justly be called "eschatological proportions": a break in the
continuity of the dynastic line, an end to the "age of heroes," a rupture or transition marked by the "moral and
physical monstrosities" of the heroes. Should this be so, it would hardly be surprising were some connections to
have been perceived, some correlations to have been made, between the crises of the two orders: an epic crisis
concerning the end of the heroic age and a mythic crisis concerning the end of the world.
This process of correlating epic with myth would most likely have gone on for a long time, in some cases
involving rearrangements of the epic story by the introduction of mythic themes in a "humanized" form. Thus one
can certainly speak of transpositions, including eschatological ones. But transposition cannot be regarded as the
only key to the "mythic exegesis."20 More fundamental is what I call a method of correlation or correspondence.
If the main skeleton of the Mahabharata* story is old, and if, as Dumézil and others like Biardeau have shown,
ancient as well as comparatively recent mythical material is reflected in
19 I hope to take up this problem in another work; for other scholars, see above, Chapter 1, nn. 86-88.

it,21 can one imagine Indian poets of one periodeven assuming it could have all been known at one
timetransposing all of this mythical material, from vastly remote periods, into one "humanized" or "historicized"
form? The "meticulous operation" of the exacting epic bards, carefully transposing all of this at once, is unrealistic.
Rather, a long process seems likely in which an epic story of ancient contours, probably at no point completely free
of mythic elements, was continually compared and integrated with mythic themesin fact, with myths and structures
of different periods. The process would have to have been conservative to explain certain long-standing para-
Vedic, Indo-Iranian, and even Indo-European myths whose influences, as Dumézil has demonstrated, show
through. But the way in which they took their footing in the Mahabharata * would seem to have been not so much
through a process of "transposition" as through a process of correlation between two levels of continually changing
and growing tradition: myth and epic. The epic poets would thus emerge not so much as programmers, transposing
one set of information into another form,22 but as rsis*, in this case the rsis* of the "Fifth Veda" whose "school" is
covered by the name of the elusive but ever-available rsi* Vyasa*. By calling attention to this term for visionaries
and poets, I refer in particular to the rsis*' faculty of "seeing connections," "equivalences," "homologies," and
"correspondences" discussed by Jan Gonda.23 This faculty of "seeing connections" would have involved the epic
poets not only with correlations between myth and epic,
21 This process has not stopped. In South India, for instance, Sakta* mythology has been transposed onto
Draupadi*.
22 Taking Dumézil's view to its conclusion, the form of a story fully "transposed" from a prior level of
meaning would be allegory, not epic. Although it is popular in India to view it as such (for instance,
Sukthankar, Mahabharata* p. 102), I do not see the epic as an allegory.

term dhih* pp. 68-69; see also Louis Renou, Religions of Ancient India (New York: Schocken, 1968), p. 18.

but also between epic and ritualespecially that of the Brahmanic * sacrifice. Thus the "mythic exegesis" must
coexist with a "ritual exegesis." Moreover, if this was the procedure and orientation of the poets, it helps to explain
why they have told certain myths at key points in the epic narrative. In some cases, they seem to have perceived
correlations between myths and adjacent portions of the epic plot, correspondences which were meant to deepen
one's awareness of the meanings on both the mythic and the epic planes, and ultimately, perhaps, to afford a
glimpse of broader unities.
