PREFACE
This book has been long in gestation, having had its genesis more than
a decade ago as a doctoral dissertation. Though one tries to cover as
many bases as possible in the study of a chosen text, inevitably an au-
thor’s intellectual preferences dictate the paths that a book takes. My
goal in studying the (cid:4)paddharmaparvan has been to approach it es-
sentially as a work of literature, to explore its meanings and to inves-
tigate its poetic forms, and to place its central ideas in the context of
thought contemporary with it. Some readers may have preferred a
more thorough text-historical analysis of the (cid:4)paddharmaparvan;
while others may despair at the long contextualising chapters explor-
ing the development of ideas in relation to (cid:2)pad and dharma. For the
former I can only hope that the discussions in these commentaries
contain enough data to animate other adventures into the (cid:4)paddhar-
maparvan. For the latter I can suggest skipping chapters two and three
and, if the narrative contextualisation and discussion of poetic devices
in chapters four and five hold no interest, then perhaps those chapters
as well. The commentaries on the texts of the (cid:4)paddharmaparvan in
chapters six through nine are partially designed as stand alone essays,
so readers may prefer to pick and choose as they see fit. Since the
completion of the original dissertation in 2004, a spate of articles and
books has appeared on some of the areas covered in this volume. I
have attempted to account for or allude to as many of these as has
been possible in the time available. Perhaps inevitably, however, there
shall be some oversights which I hope do not prove excessively irk-
some.
It would be impossible to name all the friends, family members,
acquaintances and colleagues who have at some time or other pro-
vided advice or encouragement over the many years spent writing first
the thesis and then this book. They have my deep gratitude. The per-
son to whom I owe the most is Greg Bailey, who has been a generous
mentor for well over ten years now. Greg was the first to introduce me
to the study of Sanskrit and the cultures and history of early India; he
has never ceased teaching and guiding, allowing open access to his
library and engaging in vigorous discussion on any and every topic.
For all this and more, I thank him. Eli Franco and Yashodhara Kar
were other early Sanskrit teachers who taught me much. As a young
xii PREFACE
student, Guy Petterson offered some enduring advice. In recent times,
Ian Copland has been a patient mentor and enthusiastic discussant.
The revising of this book for publication was made substantially easier
due to the extensive comments made on the original dissertation by
Alf Hiltebeitel, James Fitzgerald and Ian Mabbett. Alf Hiltebeitel gen-
erously posted me a copy of the dissertation manuscript containing his
extensive and often provocative marginalia. I have since had the great
pleasure of meeting him and engaging in further enlightening conver-
sations. James Fitzgerald generously allowed me access to a manu-
script of his translation of the Str(cid:5)-, R(cid:2)jadharma- and (cid:4)paddharma-
parvans of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata (since published by the Chicago Univer-
sity Press), which proved an endless source of insight. He also en-
gaged in a number of enjoyable and fruitful discussions on some pas-
sages from the (cid:4)paddharmaparvan. Patrick Olivelle gave me some
important advice on the concept of dharma. Simon Brodbeck has been
a frequent source of encouragement. His suggestions and criticisms of
an early draft of the manuscript were as copious as they were insight-
ful. Anita Ray and Perihan Avdi also generously read early drafts, of-
fering helpful comments and improving its readability. Rob Greuner
wrote a computer program for searching digital texts that proved
enormously useful. A study such as this would have been impossible
without the diligent efforts of the Inter-Library Loans staff at La
Trobe University’s Borchardt Library. Thanks are also due to the sup-
port of the Asian Studies Program at La Trobe University.
It’s a long way from an antipodean suburb to musing on Sanskrit
literature and early India. That this has been possible at all is in no
insignificant way due to my parents, Barry Bowles and Margaret
Dare. In a time when the liberal arts are under increasing pressure to
justify the meagre resources thrown their way, and universities are
becoming increasingly dominated by more obviously vocational stud-
ies, they have never once flinched in their support or their determina-
tion to see me through to the other side; what I owe them is certainly
beyond the parameters of what can be expressed in these pages.
This book could not possibly have been written without the unques-
tioning support and commitment of my wife Tracey Scott. In his de-
lightfully diverting way my son, Hamish, has vastly reduced the trau-
mas of writing. Each day is far better than it otherwise could have
been for having shared it with them. This book is dedicated to Tracey
and Hamish and to my grandmother, Betty Twomey, who died during
the writing of the second chapter. Her memory is a constant reminder
of what is important.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
In the course of recounting to King Janamejaya the origins of his dy-
nasty in the first book of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata (Mbh), the sage Vai(cid:5)aü-
p(cid:3)yana narrates the story of the engendering of the king’s great-great-
grandfather P(cid:3)õóu, father of the Mbh’s heroes the P(cid:3)õóavas. The story
goes that the dynastic matriarch Satyavat(cid:8), despairing at the premature
death of King Vicitrav(cid:8)rya, her youngest son, before he had ensured
the future of his line through the production of an heir, seeks the assis-
tance of Bh(cid:8)ùma, paterfamilias and elder half-brother of Vicitrav(cid:8)rya
through their father, (cid:6)aütanu. Appealing to a special law functioning
in a similar vein to levirate which exists to ensure dynastic survival,
Satyavat(cid:8) calls on Bh(cid:8)ùma to father sons on Vicitrav(cid:8)rya’s two wives,
imploring him to ‘take account of the law for crises and bear the an-
cestral burden!’1
Bh(cid:8)ùma, however, must refuse Satyavat(cid:8)’s approaches, for he has
taken a vow of celibacy and cannot recant his word. But there is yet
hope for the Bharata dynasty, and Bh(cid:8)ùma tells Satyavat(cid:8) to invite a
br(cid:3)hman of virtue to beget children in ‘the fields of Vicitrav(cid:8)rya’. And
so, by an appeal to the special laws for special circumstances, the sage
K(cid:7)ùõa Dvaip(cid:3)yana Vy(cid:3)sa—Satyavat(cid:8)’s eldest son, half-brother to
Vicitrav(cid:8)rya, ‘divider’ of the Veda and reputedly the composer of the
Great Bh(cid:2)rata—saves the Bharata dynasty from its crisis ((cid:2)pad) and
becomes the surrogate progenitor of the Mbh’s great warring clans,
the P(cid:3)õóavas and Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras (sons of P(cid:3)õóu and Dh(cid:7)trar(cid:3)ùñra). It is,
however, a false dawn. A similar dynastic crisis occurs again in the
next generation, and the same legal mechanism is employed to engen-
der the ‘sons of P(cid:3)õóu’, only for an apocalyptic war of dizzying di-
mensions to plunge the clans into a crisis greater yet again. Eventually
the cycles of crises abate, but only after the almost total annihilation
of the earth’s ruling dynasties.

erwise noted, all translations are my own.
2 CHAPTER ONE
It is thus only through a double appeal to an (cid:2)paddharma, a law for
a situation of distress substituting for laws that operate in normal cir-
cumstances, that the two Bh(cid:3)rata clans of the P(cid:3)õóavas and Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ù-
ñras—cousins descendant from Bharata—are able to come forth to
fight out the battle for the Kuru realm, the eighteen day war that forms
the heart of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata. Many years after Bh(cid:8)ùma had sought a
solution to the Bharata dynastic crisis in an (cid:2)paddharma, he is struck
down on the tenth day of the great war, a war able to arise only in
consquence of him finding a dharmic solution to the original crisis.
Arjuna provides him with a bed of arrows and, his body larded with
shafts, he waits out his last days for his boon-chosen moment of death.
But once the war is over, Yudhiùñhira, agonising over his royal re-
sponsibilties and the massive slaughter of the war, approaches Bh(cid:8)ùma
for advice at the insistence of Vy(cid:3)sa and K(cid:7)ùõa. And so Bh(cid:8)ùma, the
mighty ‘grandfather’ (pit(cid:2)maha) of the Bharata dynasty, discourses at
length to the triumphant (but not jubilant) king on all matters pertain-
ing to dharma, the laws and codes of rightful conduct of the Kuru
realm. And in the course of these instructions, Bh(cid:8)ùma returns once
again to the topic of (cid:2)paddharma, a topic in which he had demon-
strated expertise some two generations past. This book is a study of
these laws, knitted together as a collection of texts in the Mbh called
the (cid:4)paddharmaparvan ((cid:2)DhP), ‘the book on conduct in times of dis-
tress’, a collection that contends with, from a variety of perspectives
and through a variety of textual genres, the many problems and com-
plications that the notion of (cid:2)paddharma addresses and provokes.
As the above story indicates, the compound ‘(cid:2)paddharma’ itself—
which probably appears first in the MS and the Mbh, though some of
the ideas it describes reach back earlier than these two texts—funda-
mentally means ‘right conduct in times of distress’, and refers to the
relaxing of normative rules of behaviour when extraordinary social,
environmental or other difficulties, have made these normative rules
difficult to follow. In short, (cid:2)paddharma refers to exceptional rules for
exceptional circumstances. The legitimate operation of an (cid:2)pad-
dharma is strictly circumscribed according to the contingencies of
time and place. The conduct it entails is sanctioned as morally and
ethically justifiable if the circumstances merit it, a fact implicit in it
being called a ‘dharma’ and thereby being conferred whatever legiti-
macy which that word incorporates.
INTRODUCTION 3
1.1 The (cid:2)paddharmaparvan: A brief overview
The (cid:2)DhP is the second of three sub-sections of the twelfth book of
the Mbh, called the (cid:7)(cid:2)ntiparvan, the ‘book of peace’. Its thirty-nine
chapters, numbering from 129 to 167 in the Critical Edition (CE) of
the epic, are divisible into twenty-seven recognisable semantic units
that, rather than amounting to a single, unified, statement on (cid:2)pad-
dharma, reflect a diversity of approach to their organising theme, a
diversity reflected in their polygeneric characteristics. Yet, despite this
diversity, these texts consistently coalesce around and juxtapose cer-
tain themes: political conduct, different conceptions of dharma, social
disorder and social cohesion, the status of br(cid:3)hmans, the participation
of the socially marginalised in civil life, the responsibilties of the king
and the king’s right attitude to scriptural codes and the moral order
they entail. The (cid:2)DhP’s coalescence of themes, and the juxtaposition
of its texts to others included in the corpus, reveal the anxieties of a
culture in transition: What should one do when social order breaks
down? How can people survive when circumstances impede their le-
gitimate livelihoods? How can a king legitimately stabilise his rule?
What are the limits to political behaviour? And how can political con-
duct be accommodated to notions of morality that demand unwavering
standards of ethical conduct?
FIGURES 1-4 offer a cursory overview of the contents of the (cid:2)DhP,
listing its semantic units (SU) and giving their titles as found in the
colophons of the text and the chapter numbers and verse totals which
constitute each unit.2 As these lists demonstrate, while a semantic unit
may coincide with a single chapter, frequently a unit consists of more
than one chapter, as is the case with many saüv(cid:2)das (dialogues) and
up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas (stories). Since the basic unit of analysis of this book is
the semantic unit, I have not provided the titles of the chapters within
these semantic units. I include in this book’s analysis of the (cid:2)DhP the
final chapter of the RDhP (SU 1, RDhP 128) because it provides a
transition and introduction to the (cid:2)DhP, as I will further argue later,

The semantic units of the (cid:2)DhP and its introductory RDhP text can
be usefully analysed into four separate sub-groupings (as reflected in
chapters six to nine of this book). The most fundamental division of
the parvan is between SUs 1-17 and 18-28, a division indicated by the
final stanza of SU 17 ((cid:2)DhP 151.34) which marks the closure of the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
3 These are compiled in the CE of the Mbh, vol.13, part 1, pp.cxlvii-clxiv. Some
units are rarely given titles in the manuscripts (note e.g. SU 7). As would be expected,
differences between the titles tend to follow the genetic relationships implied in the
manuscript taxonomy. Though there is general uniformity found in these titles across
the various manuscripts, at times a choice had to be made between a number of op-
tions, in which case I opted for either the most commonly used title or the title that (in
my judgement) gave the clearest guide to the content of the unit.

royal instructions of the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP sequence. It should not be
assumed, however, that the remaining texts of the (cid:2)DhP do not also
have some relationship to these royal instructions. The texts in the
second group, SUs 18-28, are in my view united by their general func-
tion as transitional texts between the royal instructions of the RDhP
and (cid:2)DhP sequence, and the following MDhP. They therefore the-
matically intersect with all three sub-parvans.
The first group of texts, SUs 1-17, can further be divided on stylis-
tic grounds between units 1-13 and 14-17. Units 1-13 (see FIGURE 1)
represent the core of the discussion of (cid:2)paddharma as such, reflecting,
as a group, both the social and political problems that arise from a
‘time of distress’ ((cid:2)patk(cid:2)la). As a general rule the king is the target of
these teachings, and they reflect on his role in establishing the pros-
perity of his kingdom through the accumulation of wealth and the es-
tablishment of appropriate alliances, his control of bandit and low-
status peoples existing in the marginal lands of his territory, and the
extent of his authority to oversee his br(cid:3)hman subjects and adjudicate
on their engagement in activities appropriate to their station. While
these texts delve into problems and scenarios raised in the scholastic
traditions of the br(cid:3)hmaõic texts on dharma, they are also politically
charged and participate in a discourse frequently derived from the In-
dian tradition of political science (n(cid:5)ti). They contain six tales or fa-
bles (units 6, 8-13), some of which are known in other Indian textual
traditions, and the most famous of which is probably ‘The dialogue
between Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra and the dog-cooker’.
The second group of texts, units 14-17 (see FIGURE 2), are a collec-
tion of narratives that stand separate due to their length, multi-chapter
structure (besides SU 16) and, though they connect thematically to the
problem of ‘distress’, their generally less determined political content.
The four narratives in this group each depict a situation of crisis, but,
unlike many of the preceding units, they are rhetorically less grounded

ters should not lead to a dismissal of these texts, however, since each
makes interesting contributions—indeed, perhaps even some of the
most interesting—to the themes that animate the (cid:2)DhP and the Mbh.
The second half of the texts of the (cid:2)DhP that follow the main divi-
sion indicated by (cid:2)DhP 151.34 (SUs 18-28) can also be further di-
vided between SUs 18-24 and SUs 25-28. The first of these divisions,
SUs 18-24, is a group of texts formally united by their tendency to
develop an analysis of their topics through building descriptive cata-
logues, a technique typical of br(cid:3)hmaõic scholastic literature. These
texts fulfil what I regard to be a transitional function between the royal
instructions of the (cid:2)DhP/RDhP sequence, and the instructions on lib-
eration of the MDhP. In performing this function, their work is two-
fold, since on the one hand they reassert a normative order, while on
the other they clearly foreshadow the contents of the MDhP.4
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
4 Fitzgerald does not include SU 24 ((cid:2)DhP 158) in his section two of the (cid:2)DhP
(SUs 18-23; (cid:2)DhP 152-7), a section which he distinguishes (as I do) for their mokùa-
dharma themes (The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.159; in “Negotiating the Shape,” pp.267-
9, he suggests that these texts form a “Proto-MDhP” that preceded the development of
the MDhP proper). As explained, my incorporation of SU 24 into the group of SUs
18-24 is based on the stylistic similarities of these texts and their functions in reassert-
ing a normative order after the ‘disorder’ represented in the texts on (cid:2)paddharma.

Each of the units in the final grouping (SUs 25-28, see FIGURE 4) is
formally distinct from the others in the same group. One of the most
notable features that sets this group of units apart from the other
groups is the degree to which the frame conventions typical of
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s instructions undergo variation. In the first case, these texts
account for three of the four occasions in which Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s pres-
ence is explicitly felt in the interlocutory frames of the (cid:2)DhP. Sec-
ondly, two texts in the group, SUs 26-27, display variations in interlo-
cution that are immediately striking for their distinctiveness, with first
Nakula assuming a key interlocutory role in SU 26, and then all the
P(cid:3)õóavas plus Vidura (but not Bh(cid:8)ùma) participating in SU 27. While
these variations in the interloctory frame will be explored in greater
detail later, at the moment it is worth noting they underscore the tran-
sitional positions and functions of these units. Yet each text performs
their transitional functions in quite separate ways. Though quite dis-
tinct in form and content, the first and last of these units draw a line
under the instructions on the ‘laws in times of distress’, providing, in a
sense, a full stop (or perhaps an exclamation mark) to these instruc-
tions before the beginning of a new set of instructions with a new to-
pos. The second and third of these texts, on the other hand, can per-
haps be regarded as a pair, since the former looks back towards the
royal instructions uniting the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP corpora, while the lat-
ter first glances back, only to then look forward towards the instruc-
tions that will follow in the MDhP.
These various groupings could be analysed into still more divi-
sions, but for such further analysis the reader is referred to the com-
mentaries on each unit in chapters six to nine of this book.
8 CHAPTER ONE
1.2 A guide to this book: Propositions and directions
While individual texts of the (cid:2)DhP have occasionally been utilised for
studies in Indian ideas, history, political theory and myth, there has
been no thorough study of the (cid:2)DhP that takes the entire corpus as the
unit of analysis.5 This neglect is emblematic of the general regard for
the didactic corpora in Mbh studies. The present study, therefore, fills
two gaps in scholarship on the Mbh. On the one hand, it has been de-
signed as an introduction to, and useful tool for further research into,
the texts of the (cid:2)DhP. On the other hand, it attempts to explore the
(cid:2)DhP as, in some sense, a unitary (but not uniform) work, participat-
ing in some of the broad concerns of the Mbh and, therefore, as a
functioning part of the Mbh. The scholarly context of the latter con-
cern is explored in section 1.4.
In exploring a text like the (cid:2)DhP, one is immediately confronted
with the problem of gaining control of its diverse content. To this end,
I approach the (cid:2)DhP with two principal objectives, to explore its
meanings and to identify how it fits together. While the former leads
to the placement of the (cid:2)DhP in its broader intellectual context, the
latter leads to an investigation of the repertoire of poetic tools em-
ployed by the epic poets and/or redactors to make the (cid:2)DhP a cohe-
sive unit and, at least rhetorically, a part of the Mbh.
This book, therefore, has two principal propositions related to these
two objectives. Beginning with the second, I argue that the agencies
responsible for the creation of the (cid:2)DhP attempted to establish a co-
hesive text out of diverse materials by consistently employing a set of
poetic devices and techniques. That is to say, these authorial agents
were concerned with the way the texts of the (cid:2)DhP were compiled
into a collection. I will discuss and analyse these devices and tech-
niques in chapter five. My argument, therefore, questions the view
that the didactic corpora are amorphous and incohesive collations of
texts that received little compositional or redactorial attention. Such a
view has been suggested by Hopkins, perhaps the most influential
Mbh scholar, who said of the Mbh (and we can take this as especially
applying to the didactic corpora), “Tale is added to tale, doctrine to
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
5 J. Fitzgerald undertakes some analysis of the (cid:2)DhP in his translation (The Ma-
h(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7) and more recently in “Negotiating the Shape”; S.K. Belvalkar, the
editor of the (cid:2)DhP CE, includes some preliminary discussion in his introduction to
the (cid:2)DhP in vol.16 of the Mbh CE.
INTRODUCTION 9
doctrine, without much regard to the effect produced by the juxtaposi-
tion.”6 Even more extreme views, held by Hopkins and others, imply
and sometimes directly suggest that the didactic corpora were collated
by more or less incompetent redactors. While the argument presented
here is opposed to such views, I do not, however, assume that there is
anything simple about the semantic content and the internal structure
of the various units of the (cid:2)DhP. Their instructions are, at times,
complex, and offered from different perspectives. Nor do I mean to
suggest that there are no textual difficulties in the (cid:2)DhP (many of
which are discussed in chapters six to nine). However, my argument
does assert that we should remain open to the dynamism of the
(cid:2)DhP’s treatment of its themes, a dynamism which may well turn out
to be located in the very juxtaposing of ‘tale to tale’ or ‘doctrine to
doctrine’ which, though apparently problematic, may reveal the cen-
tral importance of, and creativity provoked by, these very same
themes.
Secondly, the (cid:2)DhP collection represents a re-articulation of the
br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship in terms of dharma. Some of the (cid:2)DhP’s
texts stridently reflect this re-articulation at the rhetorical level. At
other times it is more evident in the juxtaposition of one text to an-
other, juxtapositions revealing underlying cultural anxieties about the
proper application of royal power. No sooner, for instance, does one
text relax the normal strictures on the king’s behaviour, than another
re-asserts these limits. This re-articulation does not so much change
the substance of the br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship, as reflect a broader
cultural crisis—exemplified, for example, in the opposing values of
the sacrificing householder and the renunciant ascetic—that problema-
tises the violence perpetrated by kings and kùatriyas as part of their
br(cid:3)hmaõically defined duty. Along with this crisis, there is a broad
cultural tendency for debates over morality and ethics to take place in
terms of dharma; indeed, typically, the question becomes, ‘what is
dharma?’ Thus, of all the positions articulated in the texts collected in
the (cid:2)DhP, one of the most significant is that the extreme measures a
king might take in a situation of crisis can indeed be understood in
relationship to dharma and, therefore, as legitimate behaviour.

kins views were generally dismissive of the didactic corpora as coherent and function-
ing parts of the Mbh.
10 CHAPTER ONE
While these two propositions as they are presented here may seem
separate issues, they are, in fact, intimately implicated in each other.
The poetic form of the (cid:2)DhP, integrating this collection into the post-
war teaching of Yudhiùñhira, the one character who most clearly
represents the broader cultural conflict over proper conceptions of
dharma, establishes the authoritative character of the (cid:2)DhP texts as
part of the ‘royal revelation’ delivered by Bh(cid:8)ùma for the edification
of Yudhiùñhira, and as part of a much grander articulation of dharma
that continues in the MDhP and the DDhP of the Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sanaparvan.
This discursive integration establishes the authoritative voice of the
(cid:2)DhP discourse as part of the great tradition of the Mbh as sm(cid:8)ti.
If there is a decisive moment for the way we understand the texts of
the (cid:2)DhP, therefore, it is the defining of the unit called the (cid:4)pad-
dharmaparvan, an initiative that must be viewed as decisive for con-
ferring at least some level of structural and thematic coherence on
otherwise disconnected texts. Therefore, though the various texts mak-
ing up the collection of the (cid:2)DhP may have had a life prior to (and
beside and after) their inclusion in this collection, it is the fact of their
inclusion in the (cid:2)DhP (and hence the Mbh) that is decisive for their
meanings in this context.7 The only boundaries we can ever be certain
about are the textual boundaries imposed by the inclusion of texts in
the Mbh and its subsections. The question of what may have moti-
vated the formation of the (cid:2)DhP, and the inclusion in it of its various
texts, is, of course, difficult to answer. Moreover, by no means can we
assume that there was a single purpose behind the formation of the
collection, since it is a distinct possibility that it was not formed with
all its texts at the one time.8 If it is accepted that texts like the (cid:2)DhP
have a complex history of production, then it must also be admitted
that the isolation of these historical conditions is problematic and, in
all likelihood, not entirely resolvable. Yet, despite the inherent com-
plexities involved, attempts in this direction must be made because of
the potential insight it gives into these texts. In my view, the (cid:2)DhP
responds to specific concerns emerging in Indian intellectual traditions
associated with social and political behaviour and, furthermore, to
how these concerns are heightened by, explored and mirrored in, the
Mbh narrative. The question is, therefore, what significance attaches

ing how much time lapsed between its various chronological ‘layers’.
INTRODUCTION 11
to the texts of the (cid:2)DhP in view of their inclusion in the (cid:2)DhP collec-
tion, and having, therefore, something to do with ‘(cid:2)paddharma’?
What is the point of formally presenting the texts of the (cid:2)DhP (and
hence their concerns) as a poetic unit of the Mbh and, therefore, lend-
ing the (cid:2)DhP texts whatever cultural authority the Mbh confers?
In order to clarify the issues to which the texts of the (cid:2)DhP re-
spond, chapters two and three explore their intellectual background in
other Indian textual traditions. Firstly, chapter two investigates the
applications of concepts like (cid:2)pad (and its synonyms), and the com-
pound (cid:2)paddharma, in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras and the Kauñil(cid:5)ya Artha-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra, two textual traditions deriving from a similar cultural milieu as
the (cid:2)DhP. A striking difference accompanies the approach of each
tradition. On the one hand, the dharma literature considers the prob-
lem of ‘crises’ (cid:2)pad in the context of an individual’s survival when
environmental or social conditions are such that the pursuance of their
normative, prescribed, occupation becomes difficult or impossible.
This literature characteristically takes as its paradigm the conduct of
the br(cid:3)hman, and only secondarily treats the other social classes. It is
in this tradition that the concept of (cid:2)paddharma as such is typically
found. The KA, on the other hand, discusses the problems of (cid:2)pad in
terms of the conditions and needs of the state. Therefore, it tends to
objectively analyse a situation of distress in order that a king acting in
his kingdom’s best interests might avoid, arise from, or take advantage
of another’s, situation of distress.
While the (cid:2)DhP reflects both of these traditions, and many of its
texts are ostensibly about political expediency as we might find it
similarly presented in the KA, its narrative engine, I contend, derives
from a certain conflict over dharma. This conflict arose as an inevita-
ble consequence of the development of dharma into one of the most
important concepts in all Indian traditions, which led to a correspond-
ing broadening of its application and its assumption of an unparalleled
position of conceptual prestige within these traditions. Consequently,
in a process intimately bound to the broadening of its application, it
became standard practice to accommodate a set of cultural ideas or
practices to the concept of dharma in order to lend that set of cultural
ideas legitimacy. This, it must be said, was not necessarily obligatory.
The KA, for example, maintains a fairly restricted sense of the appli-
cation of dharma, which accords by and large with the orthodox
br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition represented in the dharma literature of the s(cid:6)tras
and early (cid:3)(cid:2)stras. It does not, therefore, consistently explain itself in
terms of dharma, since its concerns have their proper place within the
12 CHAPTER ONE
peculiarly br(cid:3)hmaõic notion of dharma to which it conforms. It was
only when dharma began to assume the position of an ethical para-
digm abstracted from the kinds of social stratifications and contingen-
cies found in its conceptualisations in early br(cid:3)hmaõic texts (like the
dharmas(cid:6)tras), that it became seen as important to describe a set of
cultural ideas in terms of dharma. These changes in the usage and
meaning of dharma are explored in chapter three.
Dharma and the problems that arise from it—how to define it, live
by it, break it, repair it and how to accommodate it to the exigencies of
a political life—are central thematic concerns of the Mbh. In chapter
four, I explore the particular way this manifests in the earlier adhy(cid:2)yas
of the (cid:6)P. In these adhy(cid:2)yas, Yudhiùñhira expresses his personal crisis
over dharma, and his apparent transgressions of it in the great Bh(cid:3)rata
war. This episode effects a transition between the ‘narrative’ and the
massive didactic corpora that will follow this episode. In terms of the
unfolding narration of the Mbh, Yudhiùñhira’s crisis provides both a
‘debriefing’ to the war and the impetus for Bh(cid:8)ùma’s instructions.9 But
there are aspects of this transition that pertain to style also. This epi-
sode is made up of numerous polemics in dialogic form, usually be-
tween Yudhiùñhira and one of his family, that rarely reach resolution
and are heavily laden with technical vocabulary, in a way that is for-
mally similar to but less systematic than the subsequent episodes of
the didactic corpora. At the same time, the frequent shift in
Yudhiùñhira’s dialogic partners retains some of the dynamism of the
interlocutory system found in the preceding sections of the narrative,
while the participation of Yudhiùñhira as one of the principal interlocu-
tors of this sequence further unites it with the later, long episode with
Bh(cid:8)ùma. The central focus on Yudhiùñhira in the (cid:6)P reflects a textual
symbiosis of character and content, since it is his continual conflict
over dharma (articulating a conflict coursing through the wider con-
temporary Indian cultural context)—a conflict present throughout the
Mbh but given specific focus in these early chapters of the (cid:6)P—that
underlies and frames the texts collected in the subsequent didactic
corpora and, hence, the (cid:2)DhP.
With chapter five the anaylsis of the (cid:2)DhP itself at last takes centre
stage. In this chapter I analyse some of the poetic techniques which
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

‘cool down’ Yudhiùñhira who is dangerously overheated after the apocalyptic battle,

INTRODUCTION 13
establish the (cid:2)DhP as a cohesive unit, that is to say, as more than just
a collection of disparate texts. This chapter takes a twofold approach
which first explores the ways in which the texts of the (cid:2)DhP are inte-
grated into their broader discursive contexts (i.e. the (cid:6)P and the Mbh)
and secondly by identifying the poetic means by which the diverse
texts of the (cid:2)DhP are integrated into the (cid:2)DhP itself. Of particular
focus in this chapter is the framing and interlocutory system of the
(cid:2)DhP, since it is this system that does most of the work of establish-
ing the (cid:2)DhP’s texts into a cohesive whole. This chapter charts a
course that will be further pursued in the four chapters that follow it, a
course which argues that the proper unit of study in a text like the
(cid:2)DhP is the frame and the enframed text together, where the frame
plays a key role in directing the (cid:2)DhP’s audiences in their hermeneu-
tic exercises.
Chapters six to nine form the heart of this book, and are probably
the chapters that will hold most interest for the general reader. These
chapters draw together the insights drawn from these earlier chapters
into a series of commentaries on each of the units that constitute the
(cid:2)DhP. These commentaries attempt to give due regard to both the
uniqueness of each text contained in the (cid:2)DhP collection (and their
linkages with other, non-Mbh, textual traditions), and the position of
each text within broader textual parameters, whether this be the
(cid:2)DhP, the (cid:6)P or the Mbh.
1.3 A note on chronologies
In The Sanskrit Epics, Brockington suggests that, “There is probably a
broad progression in terms of chronology from the R(cid:2)jadharmaparvan
(12.1-128) through the (cid:4)paddharmaparvan (12.129-167) to the
Mokùadharmaparvan (12.168-353), but effectively each passage, of-
ten of one or two adhy(cid:2)yas at a time, must … be examined individu-
ally, since the material is only loosely integrated into these major
units.”10 Fitzgerald too contends that the didactic corpora reflect a
complicated redactorial history, though he often avoids broad chrono-
logical statements, when he says, “it is not the case that the three an-
thologies of the (cid:7)(cid:2)nti Parvan were assembled at the same time and in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
10 The Sanskrit Epics, Leiden: Brill, 1998, p.152.
14 CHAPTER ONE
the same fashion”.11 He later refers to the tautness of the earlier parts
of the “r(cid:2)jadharma” instructions, a tautness “noticeably lacking in all
other parts of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s instruction of Yudhiùñhira”,12 which speaks,
when matched with his comments on chronology, to a criterion that
can be employed to identify layers of historical development within
the text. Fitzgerald further asserts that not even individual adhy(cid:2)yas
can be understood to form the basic units of text construction, for even
some of these, “particularly some in the first portions of the RDh[P]
and the ADh[P], seem at times to have been assembled into the
adhy(cid:2)yas from pre-existing passages and quotations”.13
These views of the didactic corpora reinforce the idea that they
have undergone a process of ‘layering’ over time.14 But with the com-
piling of the Pune Critical Edition having largely completed the lower
critical task of settling a text of the Mbh—widely regarded as being a
generally successful representation of an Mbh that is as ‘early’ as the
manuscript evidence will allow us to go15—it is left by and large to the
more subjective methods of higher criticism to establish such layers.
The whole procedure of identifying earlier from later layers within
parvans and individual adhy(cid:2)yas obviously requires a set of criteria
with which to make these judgements. But the question of what we
can take to provide accurate criteria is a difficult matter, as Hiltebeitel
argues in a review of Brockington’s work.16 One problem arises if we
accept the view that the didactic corpora are collections of texts that
pre-existed their inclusion in these collections (a view which is, I be-
lieve, reasonable in many respects). For then the dating of the texts on
stylistic or linguistic grounds does not necessarily solve the problem

INTRODUCTION 15
of the date of their inclusion in the Mbh—surely the more important
problem for the study of the Mbh. Indeed, a whole set of complicating
questions then come into view, since, without a source text for com-
parison, there is no way to know the degree to which a text has been
modified for its ‘new’ context. A comparison of Brockington’s and
Fitzgerald’s applications of just one ‘internal criterion’ reveals a fur-
ther problem in establishing acceptable criteria. For Brockington,
“Occasionally the exceptional length of an adhy(cid:2)ya suggests that the
passage has been incorporated at a particularly late stage, since other-
wise it would have been divided into several adhy(cid:2)yas.”17 Yet, Fitz-
gerald takes similar kinds of evidence in quite the opposite way. He
notes that the latter parts of the RDhP, which he considers to be later
than some earlier sections, contain all “but one of the multi-chapter
instructions”,18 which would seem to be precisely what Brockington’s
long passage “divided into several adhy(cid:2)yas” would look like.
Given the difficulties in clearly determining chronological layers in
the Mbh and, especially, in its didactic corpora, I have generally
avoided such reflection on the (cid:2)DhP. I do not, however, consider the
entire (cid:2)DhP to have been composed at one time, and I offer the occa-
sional suggestion in this regard in the commentaries on the (cid:2)DhP’s
texts. More precise chronological conclusions, and their implications,
shall have to await further research and more precise criteria to make
such chronological assessments. It is, however, perhaps important to
declare that I do not regard assertions of chronological layering and
assertions of syntactic cohesion to involve necessarily mutually exclu-
sive assumptions. Poetic conventions may embody forces that tran-
scend chronological moments.19 On those occasions when I do offer
chronological reflections, I have generally been guided by a combina-
tion of stylistic indications and differences in the deployment of fram-
ing strategies. While the latter, in my view, most readily reveal the
hand of whatever redactorial agents were responsible for the (cid:2)DhP, it

is the combination of both criteria that is most significant. This ap-
proach relies, of course, on the assumption that we should expect
some consistency in the style of the presentation of these texts and in
the way that they have been framed. Regardless of whether I have
deemed a text (or part thereof) to be a later addition to the (cid:2)DhP, I
still see it as my principal task to understand how it responds to its
context and functions as part of the (cid:2)DhP and Mbh.
1.4(cid:3)Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata scholarship and the didactic corpora:
What is ‘Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata’?
A study of one of the Mbh’s didactic corpora cannot ignore the prob-
lematisation of these corpora in modern scholarship on the Mbh. Fitz-
gerald has recently noted in regard to Mbh scholarship that “What is
sorely lacking is an orientation to the (cid:7)(cid:2)nti Parvan as a deliberate lit-
erary and intellectual construction, as a functioning part of the Ma-
h(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, serving some of the agendas of those people responsible
for the epic.”20 The BhG aside, this could be said for almost all of the
Mbh’s didactic corpora. This is not to say, of course, that these cor-
pora, which are primarily found in the (cid:4)raõyaka-, Udyoga-, Bh(cid:5)ùma-,
(cid:7)(cid:2)nti-, Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sana- and (cid:4)(cid:3)vamedhika-parvans, have not received con-
siderable scholarly attention. Indeed, one could cite numerous books
on ancient Indian polity, society, law and ethics, or the many specific
studies on aspects of ‘society’ in the Mbh itself, or further still, the
many dealing with the various aspects of ‘religion’ or ‘philosophy’
presented in the Mbh, that all focus almost exclusively on the Mbh’s
great didactic tracts. Yet, such studies are not concerned with the Mbh
as such; rather they utilise the Mbh as a source text for historical data,
standing alongside non-textual sources and other Indic texts, such as
the upaniùads and the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, to reconstruct India’s history, or
the history of Indian ideas. Missing, however, are explorations that
pose the question of the didactic corpora as constitutive features of the
Mbh: What is the relationship of the didactic corpora to the ‘core’

connection between the instructional anthologies of The Law for Kings and The Laws
in Times of Distress, The Book of Peace as a literary artifact within the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata
as a literary artifact, and the historical events that, I believe, provided the stimulus for
the precipitation of this grand work from its antecedent materials.”
INTRODUCTION 17
story of the fratricidal war? To the Mbh as a whole? How do they tie
into broader concerns evident elsewhere in the Mbh? How can the
didactic corpora be considered as properly constitutive of the Mbh?
This general approach reflects a tendency in Mbh studies to implic-
itly sever the didactic corpora from the Mbh’s ‘narrative core’, so that
it is unclear if the object of scholars’ investigations is the Mbh itself,
or a hypothesised ‘epic’ (entirely narrative, oral, bardic) precursor to
the Mbh, that is, something like a ‘Bh(cid:3)rata cycle’. This problem is
evident in an article by John Smith that attempts to provide a broad
conceptualisation of ‘the two Sanskrit epics’ (i.e., the Mbh and the
R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa):
The poem which is known at the present day … by the name Mah(cid:2)-
bh(cid:2)rata does not … bear much resemblance to the original bardic
poem. Between its oral composition and the literary redaction that un-
derlies the entire known manuscript tradition, the text of the Mah(cid:2)-
bh(cid:2)rata underwent a massive expansion which not merely at least
quadrupled its size, but also radically altered its character.21
What is the antecedent to the possessive pronoun ‘its’ in the last
phrase, the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata or ‘the [hypothesised] original bardic
poem’? Or both? Are we justified in calling both ‘the literary redac-
tion that underlies the entire known manuscript tradition’ and ‘the
original bardic poem’ (or, ‘oral composition’) by the name Mah(cid:2)-
bh(cid:2)rata? Or was the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata a product of quite different crea-
tive decisions to the ‘original’ oral poem that is presumed to lie at the
core of the heroic ‘narrative’? Did the text of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata un-
dergo massive expansion? Or is the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, roughly as repre-
sented in the Critical Edition, the end-product of an expansion of an
otherwise named ‘text’ or ‘poem’? Or was it a synthesis of different
elements? Can we affirm all of these statements without contradic-
tion? Smith realises the need for such questions when he later asks:
When we talk of ‘the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’, are we talking of an excerpted
‘original’? or of the existing text? or of some stage in between, perhaps
after the expansion of the epic narrative (Dr Smith22 convincingly dem-

onstrates that the four battle-books of the epic contain, in turn, increas-
ingly high proportions of non-‘original’ material, the fourth, the (cid:7)alya-
parvan, being wholly secondary) but before the insertion of the lengthy
didactic passages?23
But in posing these questions he already betrays their purpose. In cit-
ing the ‘convincing’ evidence of the high incidence of non-‘original’
material in the battle books, he seems to forget the question he has
posed, for it is not whether a passage is original to a ‘bardic poem’
supposedly lying at the Mbh’s core which is at issue, a conceptual
conflation of ‘early’ with ‘original’ that underlies much Mbh scholar-
ship, but to what the name ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’ itself refers.
Reflecting a broader problematisation of the didactic corpora as
constitutive features of the Mbh, this position has its origins in the
very beginnings of western scholarship on the Mbh. Through the
course of the development of this scholarship, this problematisation
has implicated the narrative/didactic division of the Mbh in a number
of implicit and explicit positions that can be listed as a series of binary
oppositions: early/late, unity/disunity, uniformity/disformity, orality/
textuality, heroic/religious, core/extraneous, narrative/episodic, epic/
pseudo-epic, epic/pur(cid:3)õic, kùatriya/br(cid:3)hman, s(cid:6)ta/br(cid:3)hman, original/
interpolation, secular/sectarian, essential/non-essential, primary/secon-
dary, barbaric/civilised, immoral/moral, natural/unnatural and proper/
foreign. More could surely be found. Each of these oppositions has, at
some time, been mapped against the division between the narrative of
the fratricidal war—presumed to be not merely the ‘core’ of the Mbh
considered as a whole literary work in something like its form in the
CE, but also to be the Mbh’s earliest form—and all manner of mate-
rial that especially includes the didactic corpora, but much episodic
‘narrative’ material as well.
The scholarly disposition to divide the didactic corpora off from the
basic narrative of the fratricidal war and to regard the former as later
interpolations, has its origins at least as far back as the first western
scholar to systematically study the entire Mbh, the German Indologist

the epic’ in The Great Epic, p.386.

Christian Lassen.24 Yet, it was in the late 19th century that the prob-
lem received particular focus through a debate—primarily between
two scholars, E. Washburn Hopkins and Joseph Dahlmann—that po-
larised two positions which respectively became known as the ‘ana-
lytic’ and ‘synthetic’. Dahlmann first presented his ‘synthetic’ views
of the Mbh in his volume Das Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata als Epos und Rechts-
buch.25 Contrasting himself to the prevailing view in Mbh studies that
divided the didactic books off from an earlier epic core,26 Dahlmann
proposed that the Mbh was not produced over a long period of time,
but had been collected by a single editor (diaskeuast) who combined
both didactic and narrative elements into a whole unified in its charac-
ter as sm(cid:8)ti and in its representation of dharma, with the narrative de-
signed to illustrate rules of dharma. He further suggested the date of
500 BCE for this composition.27 While Dahlmann’s views were inno-
vative in posing the question of the relationship of the didactic corpora
to the war narrative, his insistence on an early date for the Mbh, his
conviction that all of it was compiled by the one editor, and his subor-
dination of the story to the didactic purpose of the Mbh, opened him to
criticism from many scholars, even some who were sympathetic to his
general approach.
Hopkins, on the other hand, maintained the opposite view. In a se-
ries of studies peaking (but not ending) with The Great Epic of India,
Hopkins continued the trend of previous generations of scholars and
analysed the Mbh into older and younger layers. Hopkins had already
presented many of his ideas in a lengthy article on the ‘ruling caste’.28
But the debate intensified with the publication of Dahlmann’s volume,
to which Hopkins responded with an article rebutting Dahlmann’s ar-
guments,29 a rebuttal that Hopkins continued in The Great Epic. Deci-
sively for the future reception of the didactic corpora, Hopkins intro-
duced the term ‘pseudo-epic’ to designate these elements, separating

them from the ‘epic core’ and inculcating the perception that the di-
dactic corpora were not germane to the Mbh. Indeed, he boldly an-
nounced, “there can be no further question in regard to the correctness
of the term pseudo-epic as applied to these parts [the didactic books]
of the present poem”.30 Elsewhere his views were no less determina-
tive, thus referring to the “intrusion … of foreign didactic material”,31
and distinguishing an earlier ‘Bh(cid:2)rata’ epic, to be compared with the
Greek epics,32 from the Mbh as such. For Hopkins, the didactic cor-
pora were a ‘fungus’ attached to the epic core,33 a fungus that at-
tempted to morally cover over the retrograde actions of the epic he-
roes depicted in the war narrative. Hopkins further established a chro-
nology for the evolution of the Mbh, relegating the didactic corpora as
later additions to the ‘epic core’ on the basis of metrical analyses and
the different sociological data represented in the two divisions. This
chronology still forms the basis of many views of the Mbh’s growth.
Despite Hopkins’ criticisms, Dahlmann and the ‘synthetic’ view re-
ceived some support. In a long review article of Dahlmann’s book,
August Barth, despite being critical in many other respects, asserted
his general agreement with the view that the Mbh ought to be consid-
ered as a unit, “carried out in one stroke or, at least, within the limits
of a very close period of time”.34 Similarly, in a brief article, J. Kirste
agreed with Dahlmann that the epic and didactic elements interpene-
trated each other so thoroughly that “it is impossible to separate them
and to take the one for the older”, though he objected to his subor-

31 The Great Epic, p.384. One should ask, of course, ‘foreign for whom?’
32 E.g. “The Bh(cid:3)rata and the great Bh(cid:3)rata,” p.2. The distinction between a
Bh(cid:2)rata and a Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata proceeds especially from their side by side citation in
(cid:2)(cid:5)vGS 3.4.4, and from the numerous references to the ‘Bh(cid:2)rata’ in the Mbh itself. As
regards the latter, I tend to agree with Hiltebeitel that the significance of the distinc-
tion between a ‘Bh(cid:2)rata’ and ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’ within the Mbh has been overestimated
by scholars (Rethinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata: A Reader’s Guide to the Education of the
Dharma King, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.108; cf., however,
Fitzgerald, “Negotiating the Shape,” p.272 n.19). While the (cid:2)(cid:5)vGS reference cer-
tainly needs to be accounted for, it is important to note that the terms stand side by
side and do not necessarily imply that its ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’ grows out from its
‘Bh(cid:2)rata’, or that its ‘Bh(cid:2)rata’ is included in its ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’. On (cid:2)(cid:5)vGS 3.4.4 see

dination of the epic plot to the “ordinances of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra”.35
With unusual insight for the time, he also warned against the “Euro-
pean standpoint” and “European definitions of literary works” that
tend to privilege ‘epic’ over ‘didactic’ in the Mbh.36 A generation
later, Sylvain Lévi gave a somewhat different emphasis to the status of
the didactic corpora within the Mbh. Considering the Mbh to be with-
out doubt “une épopée didactique et moralisante”, he argued that it
should properly be regarded as the fifth Veda and, in addition, as the
“K(cid:3)rùõa Veda” with the BhG, the Mbh’s most famous didactic corpus,
the “le cœur et le noyau de l’ouvrage”.37
Gerrit Jan Held, though thinking that both Lévi and Dahlmann
over-emphasised the Mbh as a didactic work,38 was very critical of the
analytical method of Hopkins.39 Dissatisfied with both the analytic and
synthetic methods, Held proposed to study the Mbh from an ethno-
graphic perspective, arguing that it was structured around a potlatch
ritual. Accordingly, he considered the didactic and epic elements to
belong together, since the “task of instruction is part and parcel of the
process of initiation”. Held did not, however, consider the two ele-
ments to have been created or even combined together at once, but
rather applied a loose organic metaphor that saw them naturally attract
each other. Thus the didactic material “found its way into the Epic
through the course of centuries”, yet “they belong together; they are
naturally one”.40 The unity of the Mbh “is the unity of the form of so-
ciety with which the Epic is genetically connected” a form of society
he connects with an “antagonism existing between two groups in a
phratry-relationship”.41
The advent of the Pune Critical Edition sparked renewed interest in
the Mbh, and the surprising unity of manuscript evidence it uncovered
provoked some to reconsider prevailing ideas of the Mbh. Vittore
Pisani, responding to this edition less then a decade after Held, criti-
cised the ‘atomistic’ approaches of Hopkins and Winternitz, which

assumed “that a poem cannot rise as epic and didactic at the same
time”.42 Importantly, he noted that didactic materials tend to fill tem-
poral hiatuses in the action of the main story, suggesting that a princi-
ple of design lies behind their inclusion. He further asserted, following
Lévi, that the “poet of the Bhagavadg(cid:5)t(cid:2) is the poet of the Mah(cid:2)-
bh(cid:2)rata”.43 On the other hand, Pisani also considered the Mbh to have
been compiled from different sources.44 The great chief editor of the
CE, V.S. Sukthankar, in a posthumously published volume of lectures
delivered in 1942, also asserted a unified view of the Mbh. Sukthankar
targeted the analytical techniques of the “Western savants” (as he re-
ferred to them) noting their tendency to view the Mbh as essentially a
combination of “two mutually incompatible elements”, an “epic nu-
cleus and an extensive undigested mass of didactic-episodical matter”.
He was especially critical of Hopkins, whose chronological division of
the Mbh he considered “pretentious”, “quite hypothetical and per-
fectly arbitrary”.45 On the other hand, he was clearly impressed by
Dahlmann, though he objected to his early date, his view that the nar-
rative was invented to illustrate the prescriptive codes of dharma and
his exaggeration of the “unity and homogeneity” of the epic (or, at
least, of the version used by Dahlmann).46 For Sukthankar, the didactic
corpora are no more interpolations “than the so-called ‘epic nucleus’,
which is informed by the same high didactic and ethical purpose”. The
Mbh’s combination of “technical” matter with parables addresses the
need for all people to learn about dharma, since for some the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras
are overly obscure. The “nuclear epic theme” and the “intrusive didac-
tic interlude” are two different methods consciously utilised to express
the same central idea (presumably, living life in accordance with
dharma), and thus the (cid:4)raõyaka-, (cid:7)(cid:2)nti- and Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sana-parvans have

INTRODUCTION 23
“a vital function to perform and must be regarded as forming an inte-
gral part of the original poem in its received form”.47
Other scholars, though lacking a systematic appraisal of the didac-
tic corpora as elements of the Mbh, do deal with them as consistent
parts of the Mbh in the course of their studies. Thus both Georges
Dumézil and Madeleine Biardeau, who have utilised the Mbh to re-
construct, respectively, a trifunctional Indo-European pre-history and
the emergence of Hinduism as a religion of bhakti,48 frequently con-
sider the narrative and didactic corpora to reflect the same underlying
ideological structures. Greg Bailey, showing the influence (like
Biardeau) of structuralist theory, has suggested that what “is implicit
in the narrative material is made explicit in the didactic material” a
view that rests, he acknowledges, on the assumption of their being
“thematic unities” across the whole epic.49 Hiltebeitel, exhibiting the
influence of both Dumézil and Biardeau, considered the separation of
narrative and didactic elements in the Mbh, and the view of “all moral
pronouncements as one or another variety of Brahminical interpola-
tion”, to be too simplistic, though he did not rule out “didactic intru-
sions and extensions”. For Hiltebeitel, “epic morality” cannot be ex-
plained away “as a Brahminical veneer over a ‘heroic’ core”, and sug-
gested a more fluid and dynamic relationship in which “virtues of dif-
ferent types have found reflection in the story; and the story has
probably continued to suggest different dharmic formulations to poets
of different periods”.50 More recently, Hiltebeitel has passionately ar-
gued for the written composition of the Mbh in a period between the
second century BCE and the turn of the millenium, in which, it is
clear, he implicitly includes both narrative and didactic elements.51

24 CHAPTER ONE
It is perhaps surprising how persistently scholars have returned to a
view of the Mbh as a unit combining both narrative (‘epic’) and didac-
tic materials, especially in light of the prominence given to the view of
a prior epic core, a Bh(cid:3)rata cycle, to which the didactic materials have
been appended as ‘foreign’ material. This latter view frequently ap-
pears in overviews of Mbh scholarship, in ‘handbooks’, and some-
times, quite uncritically, in studies of the Mbh, as the accepted schol-
arly consensus.52 Hopkins’ influence was decisive in this regard, but
he was ably assisted by another scholar, Moris Winternitz, whose
campaigning was significant in the establishment of the CE project.
Winternitz had published reviews of Dahlmann’s work that essentially
criticised him for suggesting that the epic narrative had been invented
to illustrate dharmic codes.53 But it was especially in the first volume
of his A History of Indian Literature (first published in German in
1908) that his support for views akin to Hopkins were given influen-
tial focus. For Winternitz, the ‘kernel’ or ‘nucleus’ of the Mbh was an
old heroic poem, originally sung by bards for a warrior audience. In
time, a diverse range of legends was first collected around this core,
before it was co-opted by br(cid:3)hmans who introduced the great didactic
tracts and its ‘sectarian’ elements.54 As such, Winternitz saw the Mbh
as a “whole literature” or a “literary monstrosity” containing clearly
incompatible parts, and in no sense a “single and unified work”.55
Thus “our Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata … is a very different work from the original
epic poem of the battle of the Bháratas”,56 a battle he suggested was
“most probably a historical event”.57 In Winternitz, as with Hopkins,
we see all the hallmarks typical of the so-called ‘analytical’ approach:
the assertion of a prior ‘epic’, ‘Bh(cid:3)rata’ cycle, the addition of episodic
material, and a brahminisation of the Mbh that co-opts it for religious

and didactic purposes, a process that turns it into an uncontrolled mass
of heterogeneous material.
The influence of a view such as this runs deep in Mbh studies. As
van Buitenen has said, Hopkins arguments have “been largely, if tac-
itly, accepted by scholarship”.58 Thus, for example, Barend van
Nooten,59 Ruth Katz,60 James Laine,61 Barbara Stoler Miller,62 Yaroslav
Vassilkov,63 Luis González-Reimann64 and Kevin McGrath,65 all work
on the basis of there being a ‘prior’, ‘bardic’, ‘heroic’ core to the Mbh,
which has been ‘overtaken’ by other, more ‘didactic’ or ‘religious’
elements. Van Buitenen himself presents a somewhat ambiguous and,
at times, confusing position, a position that slowly drifts over the
course of the introductions to each volume of his translation of the
Mbh. While he begins by boldly asserting that the Mbh’s “grand

establish the oral origins of the Mbh, and a threefold typology of ‘epics’ into archaic,
classical and late epic periods. The latter involves the absorption of “religious and
didactic elements” (p.250). For Vassilkov, the Mbh is unique in combining all three
types. However, if it is accepted that the oral origins of the Mbh is “an established
fact”, as he maintains (p.249), though others question this (see e.g., Hiltebeitel, Re-
thinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, p.19), can this ‘oral predecessor’ also be called the Mbh?
In the process of its suggested transformation, has it gained something that makes it
the Mbh, and the hypothesised oral epic something else?

framework was a design”,66 it soon becomes unclear what he includes
in this ‘grand framework’, since much of the didactic corpora (espe-
cially the (cid:7)(cid:2)nti- and Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sana-parvans) he considers later ‘br(cid:3)h-
maõic’ additions.67 And while he expresses scepticism at the idea that
the “grand baronial tradition” was taken over by a “mentality” identi-
fied with br(cid:3)hmans,68 he later speaks of a “third phase” of composition
in which the “original story” was brahminised, during which, pre-
sumably, he would have considered the addition of much of the didac-
tic corpora to occur.69 With these expansions van Buitenen begins to
project the idea of the Mbh as a “library”, and the “central storehouse
of Brahminic-Hind(cid:4) lore”,70 an idea commonly met with in Mbh
scholarship, and distinguishes this from the notion of the “original
epic”, such expansions being frequently not “organically” connected
with the latter. What van Buitenen means exactly by ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’,
however, is unclear, as he himself suggests.71 In later volumes, van
Buitenen is less enamoured with the analytical method, suggesting
that interpolations must still be made sense of within their contexts,
since he “would like to believe” they were “attracted, even at times
provoked, by an incident in the ‘original’ ”,72 and, wisely in my view,
insists that “it is not enough to decide what was interpolated; it is nec-
essary to ask why it was interpolated”.73 Similarly, he later speaks di-
rectly to the didactic corpora, agreeing with analysts that “in the
course of time [the Mbh] also acquired a didactic purpose”, which he
distinguishes from its “epic intentions”, but, while “accepting the di-
dacticism of what Hopkins called the ‘pseudo-epic’ we should at least
attempt to delineate to what specific purposes this teaching was ap-
plied”.74 If there is a note of reluctance in van Buitenen, it is perhaps

INTRODUCTION 27
because he is no fan of “didactic Sanskrit”, which “not only does not
shy away from repetitiousness and redundancy, it is blissfully unaware
of it”.75 For van Buitenen, the Mbh has been transformed “into a work
of religious and didactic purpose”, a transformation enacted by the
Mbh’s pur(cid:3)õic legacy in a process that leads him to announce “the
epic is dead”.76 This reflects a prominent trend in Mbh studies, often
uniting the analyst and synthesist, that despairs at the literary merit of
the didactic corpora, and its impact on the narrative, ‘properly epic’,
core.77
The influence of the analytical method is readily seen in the success of
the enterprise of carving the didactic corpora off from the Mbh and, to
echo Fitzgerald again, the general absence of studies that take a didac-
tic corpus (with the notable exception of the BhG) as the unit of
analysis, and appreciate the didactic corpora as functioning parts of
the Mbh. Hopkins influence was decisive here. Though Brockington
has asserted that the “dismissive implications” of Hopkins ‘pseudo-
epic’ designation of the didactic “must be balanced by his extensive
study of epic philosophy”,78 this study, which undoubtedly was exten-
sive and important, precisely reflects the consequences of his ap-
proach, for it was divorced from any real consideration of the role and
position of the didactic corpora within the Mbh. From this point of
view, these didactic parvans are not really epic, thus not really of the
Mbh, which is ‘at its core’ truly epic, a conception which undoubtedly
is derived from an idea of ‘epic’ viewed from a tradition outside of the
Mbh, notably, among western scholars, the Greek and Latin epics.79

God, see above n.61.

79 Like so many scholars of his day, Hopkins was classically trained and held aca-
demic posts in Greek and Latin (Brockington, The Sanskrit Epics, p.47). Of course the
prejudices western scholarship inevitably reproduces when viewing the Mbh in cogni-
sance of classical European epic traditions are both productive and prohibitive. Yet
one might wonder how western scholarship would have viewed the Mbh in ignorance
of Homer and his heirs. Would van Buitenen then have proclaimed “The epic is
dead”, swept away in a tide of puraõicisation? Would the Mbh have been conceived
as an epic core concealed beneath a didactic edifice? For a brief discussion of the
application of ‘epic’ to the Mbh, see J. Brockington, “The textualization of the San-
(cid:3)
28 CHAPTER ONE
Consequently, the ‘study of the Mbh’ amounts more often than not to
a study of its ‘epic core’, the fratricidal war of the Kauravas and
P(cid:3)õóavas. In this view, the didactic corpora tell us a lot about the his-
tory of Indian ideas, but very little about the Mbh itself, and they are
reduced to only being consulted in the way one consults an encyclo-
pedia, as a source-book for cultural artifacts. Similarly, while Winter-
nitz described the Mbh as a ‘whole literature’, this did not lead him to
treat it as a whole, but rather to subdivide and compartmentalise it, a
procedure no doubt encouraged and justified by the Mbh’s poly-
generic character, but also a procedure that too readily became an end
in itself. On the other hand, despite there being a surprising number of
‘synthesists’ asserting the unity—at least, in some sense of the word—
of the Mbh in its combination of didactic and narrative elements, this
has led to very little serious consideration of the place of the didactic
corpora in the Mbh, and to very little scholarship that takes one of
these corpora as the unit of study. It is also important to recognise that
while synthesists typically suggest that the Mbh should properly be
understood as consisting of both narrative and didactic elements, they
do not insist that all the didactic elements were composed or included
in the Mbh at the one time. It is one thing to say that the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata
should properly be understood as combining ‘didactic’ and ‘narrative’
elements; it is another to ask if all the didactic elements were incorpo-
rated at the same time, and for the same purpose (one could say the
same of course, for ‘narrative’ or ‘episodic’ material).
In more recent times, there have been renewed efforts to research
the Mbh’s didactic corpora, no doubt stimulated by the high degree of
textual unity uncovered by the Pune Critical Edition. The N(cid:2)r(cid:2)yaõ(cid:5)ya
section of the MDhP has recently been the object of a substantial vol-
ume, edited by Peter Schreiner, that incorporates both sophisticated
analytical methods, as well as considerations of the N(cid:2)r(cid:2)yaõ(cid:5)ya as a

and the Divinity of the Indian Epic Hero,” Pur(cid:2)õa, 61.2 (1999), pp.97-9. It is curious
that when the Mbh is compared as ‘epic’ with epics from the classical European tradi-
tions, rarely is anything said of the didactic epics of those traditions. I can think only
of van Buitenen in “The Indian Epic,” p.53, and D. Briquel, “La «Théogonie(cid:11) d’He-
siode. Essai de comparaison indo-européene,” Revue de l’Histoire des Religions,
197.3 (1980), pp.245-76, a study, however, that is concerned with Dumézilian ‘mythic
transposition’ and not with didacticism as such.
INTRODUCTION 29
textual unit in itself and as a unit within the Mbh.80 John Brockington,
who closely emulates Hopkins’ analytic methods, discusses the didac-
tic corpora in his extensive overview of the Sanskrit epics and epic
scholarship. Brockington cautiously reaffirms Hopkins’ chronological
views, as “the best initial framework” in determining the relative age
of different parts of the Mbh.81 He too is clearly ambivalent about the
position of the didactic corpora in the Mbh, asserting, for instance,
that the (cid:7)(cid:2)nti- and Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sana-parvans, while interesting “for our un-
derstanding of the development of Hinduism”, have “little to do with
the epic proper”.82 Presumably, Brockington equates this ‘epic proper’
with the ‘oral’ poem that he thinks underlies the Mbh narrative,83 the
Bh(cid:2)rata, “an earlier and perhaps more clearly epic version” of the
Mbh.84 In a more recent article, Brockington aims to assess how far
the MDhP “is just a random collection and how far its growth con-
forms to a definite purpose or reveals a clear structure”.85 While his
conclusions are equivocal,86 this at least indicates a renewed effort to
take a didactic corpus as the unit of analysis.
James Fitzgerald, on the other hand, pursues territory already par-
tially developed by Dahlmann and Lévi. Fitzgerald’s understanding of
the Mbh is the outcome of one of the more sustained efforts in recent
times to explicitly pose the question of the didactic corpora as consti-
tutive parts of the Mbh. In his view, the constructive agency of the
creators of the Mbh is always present, and this agency was responsible
for a synthesis of at least two different ‘literary’ traditions, a synthesis
which created something close to the Mbh as presented in the CE.
Most significantly, the Mbh thereby conceived includes both narrative
and didactic elements. Thus he has argued that the Mbh was:
an elaborate fabrication (basically simultaneous with the invention of
the Bhagavadg(cid:5)t(cid:2), which is the centre and heart of our text) in which

these are not sufficient to establish that it has an overall structure”.
30 CHAPTER ONE
old epic narrative materials of a “Bh(cid:2)rata” cycle were adapted to, and
re-imagined in synthesis with, materials that existed in a distinct tradi-
tion of religious didacticism to create the “Great” Bh(cid:2)rata of Vy(cid:3)sa.87
While Fitzgerald, like Hopkins, accepts the view that there was a
‘Bh(cid:3)rata’ cycle that pre-existed the Mbh, there is a substantial differ-
ence between the two. Hopkins insists on the Mbh’s (unfortunate) ‘ac-
cretion’ of ‘extraneous’ didactic material to its epic core (“the original
Bh(cid:3)rat(cid:8) Kath(cid:3)”), Fitzgerald, on the other hand, hypothesises the crea-
tion of the Mbh out of antecedent kath(cid:2)s of a Bh(cid:3)rata cycle combined
with antecedent didactic materials. Fitzgerald further considers the
Mbh to have undergone revisions, suggesting that “this Great Bh(cid:2)rata
was subjected to deliberate extension or “updating” at least once after
the original creation of the text” (referring specifically in this instance
to the DDhP of the Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sanaparvan).88
In more recent times, Fitzgerald has developed and modified this
view, especially in regard to the incorporation of the BhG into the
Mbh.89 But the core of Fitzgerald’s argument—that the Mbh was a
literary creation drawing on a generically diverse range of literary
sources—remains in place in these later refinements of his position.
Notably, in his most recent contribution, he suggests that the “main
Mbh” (the “post-Mauryan, anti-Mauryan, MBh”) contains some “ker-
nel of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s instruction of Yudhiùñhira”.90 Fitzgerald, therefore,
attempts to acknowledge the Mbh’s complicated genesis without dis-
missing that it has claims to unity and coherence, and, most impor-
tantly, suggests that the Mbh—and not some other ‘text’, e.g. a hy-
pothesised ‘Bh(cid:2)rata’—included both narrative and didactic material at
its inception. Indeed Fitzgerald offers one of the few theories that in-
tegrates the Mbh’s great post-war books of instruction (the (cid:6)P and the

is often attentive to the dynamics operating through these didactic
corpora, discerning, for example, ‘a concerted effort to shape this col-
lection’ over chapters 60-90 of the RDhP.92 Hiltebeitel has taken mat-
ters further. Advocating a rethink on the late dating of some of the
Mbh’s didactic corpora,93 Hiltebeitel’s review of Fitzgerald’s recent
translation critiques the latter’s shift from attempting a synchronic
reading of the (cid:6)P to giving a diachronic reading, and suggests that
there is a strong “case to be made for reading Books 12 and 13 whole,
as part of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’s total design and earliest inspiration”.94
Despite their differences—and on these matters they are, at times,
considerable—both scholars clearly reinvigorate the question of the
position and function of the didactic corpora within the Mbh; indeed,
the common ground of both scholars is perhaps more remarkable than
their differences, since neither questions that the Mbh should properly
be understood as including both ‘narrative’ and ‘didactic’ material.
Clearly the days of the ‘pseudo-epic’ are fast being left behind.
Fitzgerald’s views are especially significant, since no Sanskrit Mbh
has been identified by reliable historical data that does not include at
least some, though perhaps not all, of the didactic corpora. Thus, just
as Hiltebeitel argued nearly twenty five years ago that “a K(cid:7)ùõaless
epic gains absolutely no support from the Critical Edition’s reconsti-
tuted text”,95 one could argue the infeasability of a notion of the Mbh
devoid of didactic material. The close textual analysis that accompa-
nied the creation of the CE has certainly changed Mbh studies. Like
many other scholars,96 Fitzgerald recognises that the “effort to estab-
lish a critical edition of the Sanskrit text of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata … re-

92 The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.148. However, Fitzgerald detects a “loosening of edi-
torial integration” as one progresses from this “tight organization” of the text in the
first half of the RDhP instructions through to the remainder of the RDhP, (cid:2)DhP and
MDhP and the “relatively very relaxed” DDhP. This ‘loosening’ is one of the criteria
Fitzgerald uses to bolster his hypotheses of the history of the development of the in-
structions of the RDhP (and, consequently, the (cid:2)DhP and MDhP as well). See above

well be speaking of other didactic corpora. See also pp.161-5 for further comments on

vealed that a single Sanskrit version of the “Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata”, fixed in
writing, was at the base of the entire manuscript tradition of the San-
skrit Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata”,97 though, as a reconstruction, the CE can not be
equated with this archetype.98 Similarly, whatever scant epigraphic
evidence there is suggests that the (cid:7)(cid:2)ntiparvan, at the very least, was a
part of the Mbh at a very early date.99 Furthermore, as Kirste and
B(cid:10)hler established long ago, the Mbh was received in the Indian tradi-
tion as a sm(cid:8)ti as far back as Kum(cid:3)rila (7th century), containing both a

97 “India’s fifth Veda,” p.152 and p.153 n.5 (cf. Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,
vol.7, p.xvi n.2); for a critique of Fitzgerald see A. Bigger, “The Normative Redaction
of the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata: possibilities and limitations of a working hypothesis,” in M.
Brockington (ed.), Stages and Transitions: temporal and historical frameworks in
epic and pur(cid:2)õic literature, Proceedings of the Second Dubrovnik International Con-
ference of the Sanskrit Epics and Pur(cid:3)õas August 1999, Zagreb: Croatian Academy of
Sciences and Arts, 2002, p.19. Fitzgerald follows Sukthankar (see Fitzgerald’s own
references and Sukthankar’s “Prolegomena,” in vol.1 of the CE, pp.lxxvi, lxxxvi, cii-
ciii). It is important to note that while a written archetype at the base of the Mbh
manuscript tradition can be reasoned a posteriori, there is every reason to be sceptical
of being able to uncover it, and Sukthankar frequently avoids making such claims in
respect to the CE (e.g. pp. lxxxii, lxxxvi, cii-iii), though he does consider it an attempt
to uncover “a version of the epic as old as the extant manuscript material will permit
us to reach” (his italics) which, “if the editor has done his work properly”, may be
regarded as “the ancestor of all extant manuscripts …” (pp.cii-iii). Sukthankar is not
always entirely clear, however, especially on p.lxxix, where he accounts for manu-
script variation by the assumption of an original bardic oral tradition, and then posits
the independent writing down of the text “in different epochs and under different cir-
cumstances”. Whilst the interaction between oral and written Mbh traditions is not
unlikely, it is unclear to me how the accounting of manuscript variation by positing
either an ‘original’ bardic tradition or the writing down of the text on more than one
independent occasion, is reconciled with the assertion that all extant manuscripts de-
scend from a common ancestor. See also I. Proudfoot, Ahiüs(cid:2) and a Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata
Story, Canberra: Australian National University, 1987, pp.37-9.
98 Bigger (“The Normative Redaction”) prefers the term ‘normative redaction’
rather than archetype, but the implications are similar.
99 In “The oldest extant parvan-list of the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,” JAOS, 89 (1969), pp.334-
8, Dieter Schlingloff has discussed a reference to the Mbh in a Kuù(cid:3)õa period (1st c.
CE) Buddhist Sarv(cid:3)stiv(cid:3)din manuscript from Qizil which seems to refer to the (cid:6)P, but
not the Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sanaparvan; see now E. Franco, The Spitzer Manuscript: The Oldest
Philosophical Manuscript in Sanskrit, 2 vols, Wien: Verlag der Österreichischen Aka-
demie der Wissenschaften, 2004. M. Witzel (“The Vedas and the Epics: Some Com-
parative Notes on Persons, Lineages, Geography, and Grammar,” in P. Koskikallio

Third Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Pur(cid:3)õas Septem-
ber 2002, Zagreb: Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 2005, p.62) appears to

INTRODUCTION 33
(cid:6)P and (at least material from) the Anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sanaparvan,100 but probably
even earlier.101 Perhaps most remarkably, Hiltebeitel has recently
mounted a compelling argument that the Buddhacarita of A(cid:5)vaghoùa,
a br(cid:3)hman convert to Buddhism who lived in the first to second centu-
ries of the common era, demonstrates a strong knowledge of parts of,
at least, the RDhP and MDhP, and perhaps other didactic corpora of
the Mbh too.102
While there is a fundamental paradox in our terminological distinc-
tion between the ‘narrative’ and the ‘didactic’ corpora’, in as much as
the latter are also narrated, a fact which has important implications for
the didactic corpora as discourse, there are good pragmatic and formal
grounds for maintaining a distinction between the actual texts we call
‘narrative’ and ‘didactic’.103 Whether it is assumed that this distinction
suggests that the didactic corpora were a later addition to the ‘narra-
tive core’ (Hopkins and Brockington), or that the narrative and didac-
tic elements were combined in a great compositional and editorial ef-
fort to produce the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata (Dahlmann and Fitzgerald), both
views have in common the idea that the didactic material has, in some
sense, a separate ‘origin’ from the narrative (whether viewed tempo-
rally, or culturally, or both). Distinctive Mbh discursive modes are
sometimes implied in the Mbh’s own view of itself. In Mbh 1.1.17, for
example, the sages in the Naimiùa forest ask to hear from the s(cid:6)ta
Ugra(cid:5)ravas the pur(cid:2)õa which was told by Vy(cid:3)sa, the pure (p(cid:6)õya),
sacred knowledge (br(cid:2)hm(cid:5)) of the Bh(cid:3)rata ‘history’ (itih(cid:2)sa), which is
‘adorned by refinement’ (saüsk(cid:2)ropagat(cid:2)) and ‘reinforced by various

Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie der Wissenschaften, 127.12 (1892), pp.1-58. If
it is accepted that Kum(cid:3)rila obliquely refers to the (cid:2)DhP (“Contributions to the His-
tory,” pp.10, 23; cf. Brockington, The Sanskrit Epics, p.131), then this is probably the
first reference to this sub-parvan.
101 “Contributions to the History,” p.26: extrapolating from epigraphic evidence
from the 5th and 6th centuries CE, they suggest that the Mbh “was a Sm(cid:7)ti or
Dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stra from A.D. 300, and that about A.D. 500 it certainly did not differ essen-
tially in size and in character from the present text”. Brockington (The Sanskrit Epics,
p.131) notes that a land grand dating from 532-3 CE referring to an Mbh of 100,000
verses “strongly implies the present extent of the text”.

sciences’ (n(cid:2)n(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:2)stropab(cid:8)ühit(cid:2)). Later in the same chapter (1.1.48),
Ugra(cid:5)ravas speaks of the Mbh as containing ‘histories with commen-
taries’ (itih(cid:2)s(cid:2)þ savaiy(cid:2)khy(cid:2)). In this latter citation, vaiy(cid:2)khy(cid:2) is of
particular interest, since it derives from vy-(cid:2)-(cid:2)khy(cid:2), ‘to explain’, a
verb giving rise to a number of words pertaining to ‘explanation’ and
‘commentary’. As Fitzgerald says, this “postulates a distinction be-
tween the epic narrative and expository texts … and suggests that the
latter explain, or comment upon, the former”.104 While these are rather
meagre references, and do not directly name particular elements of the
Mbh, they at least indicate that the redactors of the Mbh were well
aware that the great epic contained different modes of discourse, and
suggest that these modes were coordinated “toward a single common
end”.105 The language of the Mbh reflects this division as well. For
instance, cognates of vy-(cid:2)-(cid:2)khy(cid:2) tend to introduce didactic passages,
even when they occur in the midst of ‘narrative’ sections, and are
most frequent in the didactic books where they are often used in ‘for-
mulaic’ introductory phrases.106 While for some scholars this might
merely constitute data indicating a ‘periodisation’ that can be mapped
on the Mbh via differences in formulaic material, it may equally point
to the encoding of different ‘modes of discourse’ in the Mbh. These
differences, therefore, need not lead to total separation in the manner
of Hopkins. Rather, they may merely indicate that the Mbh rhetori-
cally signals the ascendancy of a particular genre.
We began this section by posing the question of what scholars take to
be indicated by ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’.107 In my view, there is much evidence

account for the vast majority of the instances of vy-(cid:2)-khy(cid:2). A thorough analysis of this
verb and its synonyms may well be valuable. Note also its rare use in the R(cid:3)m and its
frequent use in the KA but not MS. Cf. also the different applications of verbs like

INTRODUCTION 35
to suggest that the ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’—and I especially distinguish this
from the notion of a ‘Bh(cid:3)rata cycle’—has always included and, there-
fore, been designed with, both narrative and didactic material. The
question of a preexisting ‘Bh(cid:3)rata cycle’ is beside the point in this re-
gard. Similarly, designating a didactic corpus as a ‘later interpolation’
refuses to entertain, and therefore can never hope to grasp, whatever
intentionality might have been behind its inclusion in the composition
of the Mbh. Once again, the questions of which and at what time a
didactic corpus entered the Mbh are also beside the point. If the Mbh
has been the result of a combination of different narrative and (cid:5)(cid:3)stric
genres, this has produced a unique ‘text’, which participates in its own
hermeneutic on a variety of discursive levels, that must be distin-
guished from an oral Bh(cid:2)rata epic, assuming that such a thing lies at
the basis of the narrative of the great war. Yet, rather than being cele-
brated for its discursive complexity, the Mbh has more often than not
been mourned for the presumed passing of a more ‘uniform’ and
‘original’ version of itself, and consequently been excavated to re-
cover this ‘original form’. This scholarly practice has largely been the
result of the tacit acceptance of the view that the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata—and,
once again, this name itself must be stressed—conceals its ‘true’ self,
a self much closer to an idealised view of ‘literary epic’ than the com-
plicated, multi-generic, and massive ‘epic’ that it really is.
In order to make up for a large lacuna in Mbh scholarship, the di-
dactic corpora must be taken up for study, and arguments must be ad-
vanced posing the question of their relationship to the Mbh, the ques-
tion of their internal integrity, and the question of their meanings and
intentions. This study takes the (cid:2)DhP as a unit that occupies a unique
and integral position in the Mbh and, hence, as worthy of being stud-
ied as such. This is not a heuristic stance, but is clearly established by
the tradition of the Mbh’s transmission and reception. What remains
to be determined is the sense in which the (cid:2)DhP is a unit, and in what
sense it should be considered a part of the Mbh. This study is a move
in this direction and, hopefully, will contribute to a revival of schol-
arly interest in the didactic corpora as constitutive features of the Mbh.

CHAPTER TWO
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA
This chapter proceeds in two sections. The first explores the notion of
‘distress’ ((cid:2)pad, vyasana, k(cid:8)cchra) in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition, trac-
ing its development from the early dharmas(cid:6)tras through to the
dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras and paying particular attention to its representation in
Manu. In the second I explore the topic as it is found in the Artha-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra, the oldest and most important representative of the artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra
tradition.1
It is clear that the texts of the (cid:2)DhP arise from a similar cultural
milieu as is represented in the genres of dharma- and artha-(cid:3)(cid:2)stra,
and share much in common with them. This is especially true of the
MS and the KA. If it could be said that the MS and KA represent a
convergence beween the traditions of dharma- and artha-(cid:3)(cid:2)stra,2 par-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1 By the ‘artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition’, I mean the tradition of ‘the science of politics and
administration’, which was also often referred to as n(cid:5)ti(cid:3)(cid:2)stra, daõóan(cid:5)ti, r(cid:2)ja(cid:3)(cid:2)stra
and so on. See R.P. Kangle, The Kauñil(cid:5)ya Artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra, 3 vols, Delhi: Motilal Banar-

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 37
ticularly in their concerns for r(cid:2)jadharma, jurisprudence and contract
law,3 in some respects the didactic books of the Mbh exhibit this con-
vergence even more so. However, while it is certain that the (cid:2)DhP,
MS and KA are concerned with closely related conceptual fields and
arose from similar cultural backgrounds, the texts do not deal in an
identical manner with the problems with which they are concerned.
Accordingly, there is a considerable difference in the approach of each
textual tradition to the theme of ‘a time of distress’.
There is no comprehensive study of the topic of distress in its vari-
ous guises in Indian literature, and the present study does not aim to
fill this gap. This chapter elucidates the notions and problems that cir-
culate around ‘(cid:2)pad’ as they are dealt with in texts which provide a
background to understand the (cid:2)DhP’s handling of (cid:2)paddharma. The
traditions represented particularly by the MS and the KA bear a close
relationship to the (cid:2)DhP, making these texts the principal focus
throughout this chapter. We begin with the dharmas(cid:6)tras, late vedic
texts that, though only briefly dealing with the problem of conduct in
times of distress, reveal it in its nascent form.
2.1(cid:3)From the dharmas(cid:4)tras to the dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stras
2.1.1 The dharmas(cid:4)tras
The dharmas(cid:6)tras of Gautama, (cid:2)pastamba, Baudh(cid:3)yana and Va-
siùñha, the oldest extant texts of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition, consist of
normative precepts intended to instruct individuals in their conduct, in
their dharma.4 They prescribe proper behaviour, particularly as it re-

Intertextuality,” JIP, 32 (2004), pp.281-91.
3 Compare especially MS 7-9 and KA 3-4. For the relationship between the two,
see n.2 above. Kangle (“Manu and Kauñilya”) and Olivelle (“Manu and the Artha-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra”) both suggest that, in some instances, the MS is directly dependent on the KA.
4 For overviews of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, see Derrett, Dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra and Juridical Lit-
erature, pp.28-31; Lingat, The Classical Law, pp.18-72; Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.1, pp.18-
112. Given its similarity to the (cid:2)DhS, I do not include the dharmas(cid:6)tra of Hiraõya-
ke(cid:5)in in this discussion (see Lingat, ibid., p.23; Kane, ibid., pp.91ff.).
The dates of the dharmas(cid:6)tras are not settled. Those proposed by Kane in his
HDh(cid:7) are followed by some (see e.g. Lingat, The Classical Law, p.28 and Derrett,
Dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra and Juridical Literature, pp.28-31). Kane’s dates are: GDhS 600-400
BCE (HDh(cid:7), vol.1, pp.34-6), BDhS 600-300 BCE (pp.52-3, note that this date was
revised from the first edition’s 500-200 BCE), (cid:2)DhS 450-350 BCE (p.70, first edition

lates to people’s social class (varõa) and the occupations or forms of
livelihood (v(cid:8)tti) they opt to follow within the scope of the varõa to
which they belong. They especially appeal to the ideal standards of the
br(cid:3)hmaõic life;5 the texts were written by br(cid:3)hman men and in the
most part for br(cid:3)hman men. As Patrick Olivelle suggests, “The Brah-
min is the implied subject of most rules in the Dharmas(cid:4)tras … The
principle appears to be that when no class is explicitly mentioned or
when the subject is referred to simply by a pronoun, then a rule refers
to a Brahmin.”6
This orientation determines the manner in which the dharmas(cid:6)tras
discuss the problem of how to conduct oneself in a time of distress.
And it is this orientation, which the dharmas(cid:6)tras share more or less
with the later dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra literature, which is one of the main deter-
mining factors in distinguishing them from the tradition represented in
the KA. This latter text, though most likely composed in br(cid:3)hmaõic
circles, has as its implied subject the king, and is not so much con-
cerned with normative precepts as with the manner in which a king
should protect, sustain and expand a kingdom.
With the exception of the passage in the GDhS discussed below, in
general the dharmas(cid:6)tras only incidentally refer to ‘(cid:2)pad’ within the
course of dealing with some other topic that is not in itself concerned
with ‘distress’.7 This, too, is a feature that distinguishes these texts
from later treatments of the problem of ‘distress’ in, for example, MS
10.81-126,8 KA 4.3, 5.6 or 8 or, indeed, the (cid:2)DhP, where the theme of
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
600-300 BCE) and VDhS 300-100 BCE. Stimulating arguments have recently been
put forward by P. Olivelle (Dharmas(cid:6)tras: the law codes of Ancient India, Oxford,
1999, pp.xxv-xxxvii) who suggests revising these to: (cid:2)DhS, beginning of the 3rd c.
BCE; GDhS, middle of the 3rd c. BCE; BDhS, middle of the 2nd c. BCE, and VDhS
between 50 BCE and 50 CE. J. Houben suggests that GDhS is later than (cid:2)DhS and
BDhS (“To kill or not to kill the sacrificial animal (yaj(cid:9)a-pa(cid:3)u)? Arguments and per-
spectives in Brahmanical ethical philosophy,” in J. Houben and K. van Kooij (eds),

7 In distinction from the later dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, the Mbh and the KA, the
dharmas(cid:6)tras almost always use ‘(cid:2)pad’ to refer to a time of distress.
8 According to the transitional verse MS 9.336, all of MS 10 concerns (cid:2)pad-
dharma. However, for the present discussion greatest interest lies in the more system-
atic exposition of (cid:2)paddharma between stanzas 10.81-131. On this, see the interesting

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 39
‘distress’ receives more comprehensive treatment. As the s(cid:6)tras de-
velop into the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, and there is a concomitant expansion of the
purview of these texts, the idea of ‘distress’ receives a greater degree
of systemisation, culminating in the designation of a peculiar dharma
that operates ‘in times of distress’, that is, of course, (cid:2)paddharma, a
compound not found in the s(cid:6)tra literature (nor in the KA). I shall re-
turn to this development in the next chapter.
To a considerable degree all the dharmas(cid:6)tras handle the problem
of ‘(cid:2)pad’ in a similar manner and the texts can be cross-referenced to
each other. The GDhS contains the most thorough and extended
treatment (7.1-26):9

These are the rules for times of adversity. A br(cid:3)hman may receive vedic

one may adopt the livelihood of a kùatriya (6), when these are impossi-

cines, honey, meat, grass, water, poisons (12), and animals for slaughter
(13) and, under any circumstances, human beings, barren cows, heifers
and pregnant cows (14). According to some, one may also not trade in
land, rice, barley, goats, sheep, horses, bulls, milch-cows and oxen (15).
One is restricted to bartering (16) condiments for condiments (17) and
animals for animals (18); but not salt, prepared food (19) or sesame
seeds (20). One may, however, exchange uncooked food for an equal
amount of cooked food for immediate use (21). When none of this is
possible, one may sustain himself by any livelihood except that of a
(cid:5)(cid:4)dra (22); even that some permit when there is danger to his life (23);
but, even then one is not allowed to mix with that class or eat forbidden
food (24). When there is danger to his life, even a br(cid:3)hman may use
arms (25), and a kùatriya may resort to the livelihood of a vai(cid:5)ya (26).
The corresponding passages from related texts on dharma are given in
the table below in FIGURE 5.
GDhS 7 could be considered a significant moment in the history of
the treatment of the problem of distress. It is of some note that ‘rules
for a time of distress’ ((cid:2)patkalpa)—a conceptualisation ancticipating
the notion of (cid:2)paddharma—is the stated topic of the chapter, collect-
ing, somewhat unusually for the dharmas(cid:6)tras, rules concerning (cid:2)pad
into one coherent statement. The other dharmas(cid:6)tras tend to refer to
similar rules only incidentally within other contexts (see the table in
FIGURE 5), and do not display the degree of systemisation of the
GDhS. The (cid:2)DhS, for example, includes the passage governing trade
in times of distress that parallels GDhS 7.8-21 in a general statement
on trade for br(cid:3)hmans. Similary, the BDhS incorporates the rule al-
lowing a br(cid:3)hman to study under a non-br(cid:3)hman (GDhS 7.1-3) in a
section dealing with the student (1.3.41-2), while in (cid:2)pastamba it is
included in a section concerning the householder’s course of study
(2.4.24). These differences are significant, because while the presenta-
tion of the subject in the GDhS suggests a level of systemisation of the
notion of distress not found in the other dharmas(cid:6)tras, the similarity
of the treatment in each text indicates that they were all aware of very
similar precepts, and the problems immanent within them.
As the above cited GDhS passage demonstrates, at the very incep-
tion of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition there were features of its handling
of ‘distress’ that persist right through it. Lingat may well be right in
saying “by ‘times of distress’ ((cid:2)pad)” the dharmas(cid:6)tras mean “not
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 41
merely periods of famine or calamities, but difficult periods which
frequently arise in this Age of Iron”,11 since, given the brevity of the
s(cid:6)tra form, such an explanation may have been given or assumed
when the texts were practically applied or transmitted in pedagogic
contexts.12 However, the texts themselves give no such clues as to
what a ‘time of distress’ might be.13 Rather, they offer only the mini-
mal ‘subjective’ criteria that a situation of distress constitutes the loss
of the ability to pursue one’s prescribed livelihood (v(cid:8)tti).14 The later
dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra literature largely shares this lack of concern for a more
thorough ‘objective’ description of the characteristics of (cid:2)pad, a fea-
ture that distinguishes it from both the KA15 and the (cid:2)DhP. A minimal
definition describing the problem in a manner followed throughout the
dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition might therefore be paraphrased in the follow-
ing way: how to conduct oneself according to one’s own proper duty
(svadharma) in following one of the livelihoods (v(cid:8)tti) prescribed for
one’s social class, when conditions beyond one’s power make this
very difficult or impossible.
The fact that GDhS 7 is mostly concerned with br(cid:3)hmans reflects
the provenance of the text. The later literature to some extent broadens
this scope, a tendency already evident in both VDhS 2.22-3 (which
implies the inclusion of all three twice-born varõas) and MS 10.95-
100. Yet, both these texts still largely contextualise the primary prob-
lem through the risk a br(cid:3)hman faces when engaged in the duties of
lower social classes. In the (cid:2)DhP, Yudhiùñhira strikingly conceptual-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
11 The Classical Law, p.39
12 Derrett (Dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra and Juridical Literature, p.25) nicely describes this
process, “The earliest method [of teaching the (cid:5)(cid:3)stras] was to compress the teaching
until it received the form of a pure mnemonic. The words were a mere series of hooks
upon which a teaching could be hung.”
13 Note, for example, that drought, which is understood in both the (cid:2)DhP and KA
as a ‘crisis’, is mentioned only once in the dharmas(cid:6)tras at VDhS 3.12, a stanza that
also contains the notion of a ‘great disaster’ (mahad … bhaya), which is reminiscent
of the terminology of the KA (e.g. 4.3.1). This isolated occurrence of a superficially
‘objective’ approach to ‘calamities’ does not impact on this discussion. Notably, this
stanza concerns the consequences for kingdoms when the ignorant (avidvan) eat food
meant for the learned (vidvan); i.e. it is a cautionary injunction against certain forms
of behaviour, not an ‘objective’ analysis of ‘calamities’.

ises the root of the problem, when on two separate occasions he de-
scribes a situation of (cid:2)pad as ‘when all livelihoods on earth have be-
come those of bandits (dasyus)’.16 This is reminiscent of the closing
statements of GDhS 7.22-4 which warn against br(cid:3)hmans adopting the
livelihood of a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra, or, if following the precepts of ‘others’ who al-
low this, then to avoid mixing with (cid:5)(cid:4)dras and eating forbidden food.
If the category has changed, the fear is still the same. In each case the
livelihoods of the dasyu and the (cid:5)(cid:4)dra represent a threat that reflects a
central pathology idealised in br(cid:3)hmaõic social ideology. Contact
with, and adopting the behaviour of, the lowest social classes repre-
sents the greatest danger to one’s own (paradigmatically a br(cid:3)hman’s)
identity.17 This reflects one of the principal tropes underlying (cid:2)pad-
dharma, as both the anxiety it addresses, but also the anxiety that it
threatens to realise: the commingling and collapsing of social classes.
A ‘time of distress’, therefore, poses particular problems for the so-
cial ideologies, institutions and relationships upon which the world of

17 Is it in this sense that we should take the prohibition on a br(cid:3)hman selling cer-
tain goods (GDhS 7.8-21), a feature found throughout the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition (see
FIGURE 5. (cid:4)pad in the dharma-s(cid:6)tras and -(cid:3)(cid:2)stras)? If the br(cid:3)hman must take on the
livelihood of a vai(cid:5)ya, he should not actually become a vai(cid:5)ya? This does not, how-
ever, explain the individual items that form the list of items prohibited for a br(cid:3)hman
to trade. J.D.M. Derrett sees a Jain influence in these prohibitions, see “Forbidden
occupations in the Sm(cid:7)ti and their aftermath,” in J.P. Sinha (ed.), Ludwik Sternbach
felicitation volume, Lucknow: Akhila Bharatiya Sanskrit Parishad, 1979, pp.189-97.
See also Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.2, pp.126ff.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 43
the dharmas(cid:6)tras depends. Consequently, the dharmas(cid:6)tras’ handling
of (cid:2)pad reflects their primary concern to prescribe and preserve ap-
propiate conduct (dharma) and occupations (v(cid:8)tti) in respect to social
class (varõa), particularly for br(cid:3)hmans, the varõa which is so often
the paradigm through which the health of the broader social world is
measured. This can be further demonstrated through other references
to ‘(cid:2)pad’. For example, the (cid:2)DhS says that a student must pay his
teacher once the period of instruction in the Veda is over. The fee
should ‘normally’ be obtained ‘righteously’ (dharmataþ), but ‘in dis-
tress’ he may take it from an Ugra or (cid:5)(cid:4)dra ((cid:2)DhS 1.7.19ff.). Both the
livelihood of the teacher ((cid:2)c(cid:2)rya)—a br(cid:3)hman except, of course, in a
time of distress—and his student’s obligation are preserved (at the
expense of the lower classes!). BDhS 2.5, which concerns injunctions
pertaining to ritual bathing and libations, instructs members of the
twice-born classes to offer water to the ‘gods, sages and ancestors’
upon waking up in the morning (2.5.4). But water that is confined (i.e.
in tanks, wells or dams) should not be used, for the ‘dam-builder’
(setuk(cid:8)t) would then obtain a share of the offering (2.5.5). Subse-
quently, however, this rule is relaxed in a time of distress (2.5.7; cf.
ViS 64.2). The priority to maintain the libations outweighs the prob-
lems of where one accesses the water. The components of the rule (i.e.
the libation, the getting of water, the type of water obtained) are pri-
oritised in such a way that the fundamental component of the rule, the
libation, which defines a set of relations to the social world (and the
gods), is preserved. Without the libation the three twice-born castes
would lose a feature which distinguishes them from the (cid:5)(cid:4)dras. A
similar occurrence in GDhS 9 contains a long list of rules for the ‘bath
graduate’ sn(cid:2)taka, rules that in a time of distress (9.67) need only be
maintained mentally (manas(cid:2)). Once again, this is the bare essence
that defines an individual within a social and religious context; peo-
ple’s identities are contingent upon their behaviour when considered
in relation to their social class.18
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
18 Cf. BDhS 2.18.15-18 which explicitly refers to maintaining a bare minimum of
a particular observance in a time of distress.
44 CHAPTER TWO
2.1.2 Manu and beyond
If we trace the development of the ideas circulating around the notion
of ‘(cid:2)pad’ into the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, we first notice that there has been
an expansion of the treatment of the topic, particularly in the MS. So
much do the references to ‘times of distress’ increase in the MS that
one recent co-translator can say that the MS is not “so much a text on
dharma as it is on (cid:2)pad dharma”.19 Whatever one may think of this
view, it is certainly true that there is an increase in the number of rules
relaxed for extreme situations. This is notable for the GDhS passage
we have already discussed, the heart of which (7.4-21) still forms the
central statement on (cid:2)pad as it appears in parallel passages in the later
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras (see table in FIGURE 5). Following on from a passage that
deals with the proper acts (karman, dharma) and livelihoods (j(cid:5)vak(cid:2)—
a synonym for v(cid:8)tti20) of the three twice-born castes (MS 10.74-80),
the whole section from MS 10.81-130,21 the ‘duties of the four castes
in a time of distress’ (caturõ(cid:2)ü varõ(cid:2)n(cid:2)m (cid:2)paddharm(cid:2)þ),22 though
expanding greatly on the material found in the dharmas(cid:6)tras, mirrors
their concern for balancing the dictates on livelihoods (v(cid:8)tti) with the
need to seek a living in difficult times.
Perhaps the most obvious way in which the MS expands on the ear-
lier texts is its extension of the scope of its discussion to include all
the varõas, a concern that barely bothered the dharmas(cid:6)trins. The dis-
cussion begins in 10.81 which states that a br(cid:3)hman unable to live
(aj(cid:5)van) by his own proper activity (svena karmaõ(cid:2)) can adopt the
duty of a kùatriya, or, failing that, the livelihood (j(cid:5)vak(cid:2)) of a vai(cid:5)ya
(10.82). But the subsequent prohibitions (10.83ff.) against making a
living by the livelihood of a vai(cid:5)ya (vai(cid:3)yav(cid:8)tty(cid:2) … j(cid:5)van) are meant
for both br(cid:3)hmans and kùatriyas, though in 10.92-4 there are further
prohibitions (along with the consequences of not following them) spe-
cifically directed at br(cid:3)hmans. Specific rules for the kùatriya are men-
tioned in 10.95 (in adversity he may live by all the means discussed in
10.83-94, including those which are prohibited for a br(cid:3)hman in 92-4),
the vai(cid:5)ya in 10.98, and the (cid:5)(cid:4)dra in 10.99-100 and again in 10.121-9.

22 MS 10.130.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 45
In the case of the (cid:5)(cid:4)dras, 10.99-100 states that when they cannot
engage in service to a twice-born, then they may practice the ‘activi-
ties of an artisan’ (k(cid:2)rukakarman) and ‘handicrafts’ ((cid:3)ilpa).23 This ap-
pears to imply that such activities are ordinarily above the (cid:5)(cid:4)dra class,
and hence this would be the only case in which a person is allowed to
adopt the behaviour of the caste above them, strongly disapproved of
elsewhere.24 But there is some difficulty in this passage, for while MS
10.99-100 and YS 1.120 clearly imply that these are not the ordinary
livelihoods of (cid:5)(cid:4)dras, they are also nowhere stated to be those of the
vai(cid:5)ya. In fact, in both GDhS 10.60 and ViS 2.14 (cid:3)ilpa is said to be
one of the means of livelihood for a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra and, furthermore, in KA
1.3.8 so is k(cid:2)ru.25 It seems that this is an inconsistent area in the texts,
possibly because it is an instance of conflict between the varõa and
j(cid:2)ti systems.26 Even in Manu there are times when (cid:5)(cid:4)dras, artisans
(k(cid:2)ru) and craftsmen ((cid:3)ilpin) are mentioned in the same sequence,
suggesting at the very least that their status was quite similar. Indeed
this occurs in 10.120, in which the king’s entitlements to tax in a time
of distress are enumerated immediately following a reference in the
same context to the vai(cid:5)ya (vi(cid:3)), implying a distinction between the
vai(cid:5)ya, artisans and craftsmen.27 Whatever the solution to this prob-
lem, and it may prove intractable, it is significant, as Rocher points
out, that Manu says these activities and handicrafts are those ‘by
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
23 It is not really clear how an an artisan (k(cid:2)ru, k(cid:2)ruka) and a craftsman ((cid:3)ilpin)
differ. They often occur in sequence, e.g. YS 2.249, KA 1.18.12, 2.6.2, 2.18.1,
2.23.10 and many others.
24 MS 10.95-6, VDhS 2.23. Yet in the passage dealing with the same concern in
NS 1.54, there is the following remarkable statement suggesting a far more flexible
situation than Manu: utk(cid:8)ùñaü c(cid:2)pak(cid:8)ùñaü ca tayoþ karma na vidyate | madhyame
karmaõ(cid:5) hitv(cid:2) sarvas(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõe hi te || ‘A br(cid:3)hmaõa and a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra may not do each
other’s work, but the work of a kùatriya or a vai(cid:5)ya is permissible because these are
common to all’ (trans. R.W. Lariviere, The N(cid:2)radasm(cid:8)ti. Critically edited with an
introduction, annotated translation, and appendices, Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania, 1989). Similarly, YS 1.120 says that a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra unable to live (aj(cid:5)van) by
service to the twice-born can be a merchant (vaõij), i.e. a typically vai(cid:5)ya occupation.
25 Kangle, in The Kauñil(cid:5)ya, vol.2, p.8 n.8, couples Gautama (10.60) with Y(cid:3)j(cid:9)a-
valkya (1.120) in allowing a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra “an artisan’s profession only if service of the
twice-born is not possible”. However, in his list of (cid:5)(cid:4)dra occupations Gautama says
only (cid:3)ilpav(cid:8)tti(cid:3) ca, ‘and the occupation of a craftsman’. There is no implication that
this is only in the case that he cannot live by (cid:3)u(cid:3)r(cid:6)ù(cid:2).
26 Feasibly it also evidences shifting taxonomies and hierarchies of occupations.
27 Cf. MS 7.138. In the KA, the (cid:5)(cid:4)dra is housed with the artisans (k(cid:2)ravaþ) in the
western quarter (2.4.13), the vai(cid:5)yas in the southern quarter (2.4.11). Cf. also Kangle,
The Kauñil(cid:5)ya, vol.3, p.143, “The arts and crafts, however, appear to be practised by
the (cid:5)(cid:4)dra alone.”
46 CHAPTER TWO
which the twice-born are served’ (yaiþ … (cid:3)u(cid:3)r(cid:6)ùyante dvij(cid:2)tayaþ). If
Manu implies that (cid:5)(cid:4)dras may adopt livelihoods that are higher than
their position in the varõa hierarchy, it is all for the purpose of main-
taining their own principal dharma, service ((cid:3)u(cid:3)r(cid:6)ù(cid:2)) to the twice-
born.28 This requirement for (cid:5)(cid:4)dras to serve the twice-born classes is
stressed again in 10.121-9. In fact, this passage is quite significant, for
though it is contained in the (cid:2)paddharma section, the injunctions
within it accord very closely to the duties of a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra found elsewhere
(e.g. GDhS 10.56-61). It seems that (cid:2)paddharma for a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra is not
really all that much different from a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra’s ordinary dharma.
This treatment of the (cid:5)(cid:4)dra reflects the ambivalence (cid:2)paddharma
often provokes. For if rules are provided in order to allow a degree of
flexibility in livelihoods in accordance with what we might expect are
widely varying environmental, social and cultural conditions, at the
same time the dangers of such a relaxation are never far from the sur-
face. Thus the injunctions against adopting the livelihoods of a higher
caste (MS 10.96); the famous verse that says it is better to do one’s
own duty badly than someone else’s (MS 10.97), close parallels of
which occur twice in the Bhagavadg(cid:5)t(cid:2) (Mbh 6.25.35 and 6.40.47);
and the prohibitions on selling certain items in 10.86-94, which we
have already discussed. Of particular interest in this regard is MS
10.92-3 (cf. YS 3.40):
sadyaþ patati m(cid:2)üsena l(cid:2)kùay(cid:2) lavaõena ca |
tryaheõa (cid:3)(cid:6)dro bhavati br(cid:2)hmaõaþ kù(cid:5)ravikray(cid:2)t ||
itareù(cid:2)ü tu paõy(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü vikray(cid:2)d iha k(cid:2)mataþ |
br(cid:2)hmaõaþ saptar(cid:2)treõa vai(cid:3)yabh(cid:2)vaü niyacchati ||
By selling meat, lac or salt, a br(cid:3)hman immediately falls; by selling
milk he becomes a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra in three days; but by willfully selling the other
[prohibited] commodities here, a br(cid:3)hman becomes a vai(cid:5)ya in seven
nights.
In this extract the danger that (cid:2)paddharma represents is fully ex-
pressed, as we should expect, through the br(cid:3)hman, the preeminent
paradigm of the dharma literature. By allowing people to perform du-
ties proper to varõas other than their own, there is always the danger
that br(cid:3)hmans will become indistinguishable from other classes (and,
of course, vice versa), and consequently the order of the social world
(and, so, the universe) that is immanent in the separation of the varõas
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
28 Rocher, “Caste and occupation,” pp.145f. Cf. YS 1.120.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 47
will be corrupted. It is not surprising then that Manu (10.101ff.), like
Gautama (7.4-5), clearly prefers a br(cid:3)hman to live by the three means
of livelihood (y(cid:2)jana ‘sacrificing for others’; adhy(cid:2)pane ‘teaching’;
pratigrahaþ ‘accepting gifts’) listed among his six proper activities
(karman) in MS 10.76. It is significant also that of the six activities ‘it
is fixed’ (sthiti) that these three means of livelihood (here called
dharmas) are prohibited for the other twice-born varõas (10.77-8).
While Manu relaxes rules for times of distress, he preserves features
that distinguish br(cid:3)hmans from the other twice-born social classes. At
such a time he can accept gifts from, teach, or sacrifice for even con-
temptible people (garhita) without incurring faults (doùa).29 The worst
of these three means is accepting gifts, and this is not because it has
anything to do with a contemptible person, but rather because one can
accept gifts even from a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra of the lowest birth (antyajanman), for
even in distress sacrificing or teaching are reserved only for those
people who have received the purificatory rites (saüsk(cid:8)t(cid:2)tman),
whether they be contemptible or otherwise (MS 10.109-10).
Manu and the later dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras contain many other ‘new’ fea-
tures indicating that the notion of (cid:2)paddharma posed a problem for
the normative value of the many rules of dharma. A new type of rule
not found in the dharmas(cid:6)tras emerges in which, after an injunction,
an additional statement stresses that the rule applies ‘even in a time of
distress’. Typically such a statement contains a word for distress (usu-
ally (cid:2)pad) in the locative case followed by the particle api, as the fol-
lowing examples from the MS illustrate:
naitair ap(cid:6)tair vidhivad (cid:2)pady api hi karhicit |
br(cid:2)hm(cid:2)n yaun(cid:2)ü(cid:3) ca saübandh(cid:2)n n(cid:2)cared br(cid:2)hmaõaþ saha || 2.40
For a br(cid:3)hman should never participate in a sacral or conjugal relation-
ship with those people who have not been purified according to rule
(i.e. by the upan(cid:2)yana initiation), even in a time of distress.
na br(cid:2)hmaõakùatriyayor (cid:2)pady api hi tiùñhatoþ |
kasmiü(cid:3)cidapi v(cid:8)tt(cid:2)nte (cid:3)(cid:6)dr(cid:2) bh(cid:2)ryopadi(cid:3)yate || 3.14
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
29 MS 10.103. In contrast, MS 10.76 has y(cid:2)jan(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)pane caiva vi(cid:3)uddh(cid:2)c ca
pratigrahaþ, which B(cid:10)hler, Smith and Doniger, and Rocher, “Caste and occupation,”
p.140, all take to mean ‘sacrificing for others, teaching, and accepting gifts from pure
people’. This phrase mirrors that in MS 10.103: adhy(cid:2)pan(cid:2)d y(cid:2)jan(cid:2)d v(cid:2) garhit(cid:2)d v(cid:2)
pratigrah(cid:2)d. B(cid:10)hler, Olivelle and Smith and Doniger (rightly) understand garhit(cid:2)d to
operate with all three terms (Rocher does not discuss it), suggesting that the three
terms in 10.76 ought also to be understood in relation to vi(cid:3)uddha.
48 CHAPTER TWO
For a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra woman is not mentioned in any tale at all as the wife of a
br(cid:3)hman or a kùatriya, even if they are living in a time of distress.
g(cid:8)he gur(cid:2)v araõye v(cid:2) nivasann (cid:2)tmav(cid:2)n dvijaþ |
n(cid:2)vedavihit(cid:2)ü hiüs(cid:2)m (cid:2)pady api sam(cid:2)caret || 5.4330
A prudent br(cid:3)hman should not engage in violence not sanctioned by the
Veda, whether he is living in his own home, his guru’s, or in the forest,
even in a time of distress.
par(cid:2)m apy (cid:2)padaü pr(cid:2)pto br(cid:2)hmaõ(cid:2)n na prakopayet |
te hy enaü kupit(cid:2) hanyuþ sadyaþ sabalav(cid:2)hanam || 9.313
Even if he has incurred the greatest distress, [a king] should not make
br(cid:3)hmans angry, for when angered they would instantly destroy him,
along with his army and vehicles.
Other examples occur in 2.113 ((cid:2)pady api), 4.15 (n(cid:2)rty(cid:2)m api) and
6.16 ((cid:2)rto ’pi), and similar constructions are found in other (cid:3)(cid:2)stras.31
The proliferation of this kind of rule calls for explanation, particu-
larly considering that similar rules in the dharmas(cid:6)tras do not mention
that it applies ‘even in times of (cid:2)pad’.32 An injunction that a rule ap-
plies even in a time of distress serves the rhetorical purpose of empha-
sising the importance of the injunction. It also suggests that there was
a perception of an increased laxity in the observance of the rules laid
down in the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, a laxity, indeed, opened up by the idea of
‘(cid:2)paddharma’ itself. In this context, it is worthwhile noting MS 12.70,
which warns against slipping from the standard rules when there is no
time of distress. Though this is clearly linked to the idea that one
should return to the livelihood appropriate for one’s caste and station
when a time of distress has passed, a statement found, for example, in
(cid:2)DhS 1.21.4 and YS 3.35,33 this is an injunction of a different kind
which assumes that the adoption of the lower v(cid:8)tti was an indulgence
and not the result of dire necessity.34 This is also reflected in NS 1.56,
which states that a br(cid:3)hman continuing in a kùatriya livelihood once
the time of distress has passed because he enjoys it (ras(cid:2)t), ‘is called
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
30 Cf. ViS 51.66.
31 For example YS 3.29, NS 1.98 and 4.4, and ViS 51.66 (= MS 5.43).
32 E.g. MS 2.40: (cid:2)DhS 1.2.6, VDhS 11.75; MS 2.113: BDhS 1.4.1; MS 3.14:
VDhS 1.26.
33 Cf. Rocher, “Caste and occupation,” pp.35f. See also MS 10.98.
34 Cf. MS 11.28-30 for a comparable injunction in the context of sacrifice (29-30
are repeated in (cid:2)DhP 159.15-16). Such injunctions have a similar purpose to those
that insist social obligations be fulfilled before one renounces (so that it is not used to
avoid these obligations), cf. Olivelle, “Renouncer and renunciation,” p.146.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 49
an “arrow back” ’.35 Either way, this ‘new’ way of formulating rules
indicates that a contrast between dharmas prevailing in normal condi-
tions and those prevailing in times of distress was gaining in currency
in the period of these (cid:3)(cid:2)stras.
Another notable way in which (cid:2)pad occurs is in injunctions which
do ‘not apply when one is in distress’ (an(cid:2)padi). Such occurrences
allow for exceptional circumstances in which a stated rule may not
apply, and hence are little different from other incidental instances of
(cid:2)pad. In such statements, an(cid:2)padi is always found at the end of the
second or fourth pada, for example: MS 4.2, which states that a br(cid:3)h-
man should adopt a livelihood that causes ‘no harm or very little
harm’ to living things unless he is in distress; 4.100, a twice-born per-
son should always practice vedic recitation, except when in distress;
5.33, a twice-born person ‘who knows the rules’ should not eat meat
against the rules (avidhin(cid:2)), unless he is in distress;36 8.61 (see p.51
below); 9.58 in which, in the context of levirate (niyoga), an elder
brother is prohibited from having sex with the wife of a younger
brother, or vice versa, unless there is a situation of distress (rule stated
9.56ff.);37 9.282 which states that a person should be fined for excret-
ing something impure (amedhya) on the royal road (r(cid:2)jam(cid:2)rga),
unless he is in distress, in which case he should only be made to clean
it up (9.283); NS 1.22 (see p.51 below); and YS 1.32 and 1.160 which
restrict from whom a br(cid:3)hman student can accept food, unless he is in
distress. The only precedent to this kind of usage of (cid:2)pad in the
dharmas(cid:6)tras is in (cid:2)DhS 1.8.24, which instructs that ‘unless a teacher
is in distress’ (an(cid:2)patsu) he should not exploit a student to the detri-
ment of his studies.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
35 In a note to this verse, Lariviere, The N(cid:2)radasm(cid:8)ti, says “Bhava (a commenta-
tor) explains that a k(cid:2)õóap(cid:8)ùñha ‘arrow back’ is a professional soldier and that the
br(cid:3)hmaõa becomes a kùatriya”.
36 Smith and Doniger misunderstand this verse, translating it in the same way as
the (cid:2)pady api ‘even in a time of distress’ type statement discussed above, which rein-
forces the strength of the injunction. Yet it is clearly an instance of an exception,
rather than of there being no exception, which is the essential difference between the
two instances. B(cid:10)hler seems to conflate avidhin(cid:2) and an(cid:2)padi when he translates this
as ‘except in conformity with the law’, thus he captures the ‘exceptional’ sense with-
out strictly adhering to the text.
37 This is described as dharmam (cid:2)padi, a ‘dharma in times of distress’. The ‘dis-
tress’ is that there is no male offspring (see G. B(cid:10)hler, The Laws of Manu, Delhi: Mo-
tilal Banarsidass, 1964 (11886), p.337 n.56; Smith and Doniger, The Laws, p.203) and
the solution is, of course, niyoga (see n.52 below).
50 CHAPTER TWO
There are, of course, many other rules concerning (cid:2)pad which con-
form to the general type we found in the earliest references from the
dharmas(cid:6)tras, to the effect ‘this is the rule for a time of distress’. Be-
sides the long passage following MS 10.81 discussed above, other ex-
amples are the aforementioned rules (9.56ff.) concerning a woman in
a time of distress38 (cf. 9.103), and 11.227 which rules that an evil-
doer (p(cid:2)pak(cid:8)t) in a time of distress is freed from evil through generos-
ity (d(cid:2)na). NS 12.97 is in a similar vein, outlining in an unusual ruling
for the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition the ‘five calamities’ due to which a
woman can remarry: her husband’s disappearance, death, renuncia-
tion, impotence (kl(cid:5)ba), or his becoming an outcaste.39
Much of the further expansion of these rules follows the manner in
which the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras as a whole expanded their scope in the direction of
judicial rules, contract law and r(cid:2)jadharma.40 Though neither judicial
procedures nor contract law bear directly on our concern to look from
the perspective of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras towards the (cid:2)DhP, some of
these instances are worth citing to show how the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras ex-
panded pre-existing concepts (such as the idea of a different rule for a
time of (cid:2)pad) to envelop new concerns that were coming within the
orbit of these texts. Invariably they constitute incidental references in
the context of broader discussions. In the NS, for example, a text
Richard Lariviere describes as “the only original collection of legal
maxims (m(cid:6)lasm(cid:8)ti) which is purely juridical in character”,41 a list of
people who should not be arrested ((cid:2)sedhya) or summoned by the
king includes those ‘in crisis’ (vyasane sthitaþ) and ‘in difficulty’ (vi-
ùamastha).42 The same text also has a number of instances in the con-
text of financial relationships: in 1.09 a father should repay his son if
he has ordered him to contract a debt ((cid:8)õa) to support his family (ku-
ñumbabharaõa) or when there is a time of distress (k(cid:8)cchra); in 1.15
(cf. KS 569) a debt entered into by a wife never becomes her hus-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
38 See n.37 above.

band’s debt, unless it was made when he was in distress ((cid:2)patk(cid:8)t(cid:2)d (cid:8)te
puüs(cid:2)ü); in 1.22 transactions entered into by women are invalid,
unless they are in distress (an(cid:2)padi); in 1.98, a rule reminiscent of
those concerned with livelihoods discussed above, a vai(cid:5)ya may en-
gage in usury (v(cid:2)rdhuùa) to overcome a calamity ((cid:2)padaü nistared),
but never a br(cid:3)hman, even in times of grevious calamity ((cid:2)patsv api
… kaùñ(cid:2)su); and a number of rules that apply when a calamity
(vyasana) overtakes a financial partnership (3.6-8). Similarly, YS 2.32
and BP 1.1.123 contain a rule invalidating a contract (vyavah(cid:2)ra)
made by a person who, among other things, is distressed ((cid:2)rta) or in a
crisis (vyasanin);43 in YS 2.50, when a father is overwhelmed by a
calamity (vyasan(cid:2)bhiplute), his sons or grandsons should pay his debt
(cf. BP 1.10.109-10); and BP 1.10.12 and KS 498 rule that a debtor
((cid:8)õika) should be repaid (d(cid:2)patavya) interest (v(cid:8)ddhi) paid in a time of
distress ((cid:2)patk(cid:2)la). Finally, mention should be made of the rules con-
cerning witnesses (s(cid:2)kùin) in the MS: 8.61 states that not just anyone
can be a witness unless there is a crisis (an(cid:2)padi); and, in a list of
people who cannot be called as witnesses, 8.67 includes someone dis-
tressed ((cid:2)rta), someone ‘afflicted with hunger or thirst’ (kùutt(cid:8)ùõopa-
p(cid:5)óita), or someone ‘utterly exhausted’ ((cid:3)ram(cid:2)rta). This passage
draws out a feature of the texts on dharma. While a ‘time of distress’
may refer to a general calamity that afflicts a community or kingdom,
or to a crisis that afflicts an individual alone, it is intriguing that in the
principal sections dealing with (cid:2)pad (e.g. MS 10.81ff.) there is no dis-
tinction between the two. In either case, the defining principle for the
dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stric tradition is the inability of individuals to perform their
prescribed social obligations and duties due to conditions beyond their
control.
Where the MS is concerned with r(cid:2)jadharma it broadens its scope
to include elements that draw it into the sphere of the artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tra-
dition,44 and we find this reflected in the few instances where the no-
tion of distress is discussed in this context. Typically, these passages
concern either generation of wealth or the assessment of the relative
strength of a king’s own and his enemy’s kingdom. The MS passage
that especially concerns (cid:2)paddharma (10.81-131) contains only brief
specifications for the king: 10.96 says the king should banish people
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
43 A similar rule in MS 8.163 and KA 3.1.13 includes only (cid:2)rta.
44 See now Olivelle, “Manu and the Artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra,” and Manu’s Code of Law,
pp.46-50.
52 CHAPTER TWO
greedily living by occupations proper to social classes higher than
their own, and 10.118-20 outlines the rules for tax ‘in times of dis-
tress’, an issue dealt with at length in the KA.45 Otherwise, rules for
distress relating to the king are especially found, as should be ex-
pected, in chapters on r(cid:2)jadharma. MS 7.182, for example, recom-
mends that besides the months of m(cid:2)rga(cid:3)(cid:5)rùa (mid-November to mid-
December) and ph(cid:2)lguna to caitra (mid-February to mid-April), a
king should also march ‘when a disaster has befallen’ (vyasane … ut-
thite) his enemy. This is advocated in similar, but more detailed pas-
sages in KA 9.1.40-3 (cf. 7.4.15) and RDhP 12.101.9-10. MS 9.294
enumerates the seven constituents (prak(cid:8)ti) of the state, a well known
taxonomy also found in KA 6.1: the king, ministers, the city (or fort),
the kingdom, the treasury, the army and allies.46 Of these, MS 9.295
states that each earlier one is the more important, and their loss the
greater disaster (vyasana).47 And again in MS 9.298-9, a king should
ascertain his own strength (sva(cid:3)akti) and his enemy’s strength (para-
(cid:3)akti) and, after considering all their afflictions (p(cid:5)óana) and crises
(vyasana),48 should commence his operation. Finally, MS 7.213-14
nicely underscores the approach of the n(cid:5)ti tradition to the problem of
calamities, as we shall find also in the discussion on the KA. The first
of these verses directs the king to preserve wealth for a time of dis-
tress ((cid:2)padartha), save his wife with his wealth, and his own self with
his wife and wealth. The second states that having seen all kinds of
calamities ((cid:2)pad) arise (samutpanna), the king should use all of the
strategies (sarvop(cid:2)ya) to save himself. Two things from these verses
are worthy of note. Firstly, the emphasis given to the king saving him-
self is probably due both to the fear of the kingless state (ar(cid:2)jaka)49
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
45 See below pp.68ff.
46 sv(cid:2)myam(cid:2)tyau puraü r(cid:2)ùñraü ko(cid:3)adaõóau suh(cid:8)t tath(cid:2) | Cf. KA 6.1.1 sv(cid:2)my-
am(cid:2)tyajanapadadurgako(cid:3)adaõóamitr(cid:2)õi prak(cid:8)tayaþ | Cf. also RDhP 69.62-3, and
elsewhere.
47 This is discussed at length in KA 8.1, in which Kauñilya argues against views
counter to this formula. See below pp.65f.
48 In this context vyasana could also be ‘vices’ as it is understood by both
Smith/Doniger and B(cid:10)hler. Olivelle translates it as ‘evils’, capturing some of the se-
mantic ambiguity of the term. On the meaning of vyasana as either ‘calamity’ or
‘vice’, see pp.67f. below.
49 Cf. MS 7.3; MDhP 308.159, where the lord emitted (as(cid:8)jat prabhuþ) a king
when the world was kingless (ar(cid:2)jaka) out of fear the people had dispersed in all di-
rections. The ‘fear of the kingless state’ is developed at length in the RDhP, e.g.
49.62, ar(cid:2)jake j(cid:5)valoke durbal(cid:2) balavattaraiþ b(cid:2)dhyante, ‘when the world of people
is kingless, the weak are oppressed by the strong’, and especially 67.16-17 which
(cid:3)
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 53
and the belief that it is the king’s responsibility to alleviate a situation
of distress and to assert normative dharma.50 Secondly, the advice for
the king to save himself and therefore his kingdom from a crisis by
pursuing ‘all strategies’ refers in particular to the four strategies of MS
7.198-200—conciliation (s(cid:2)man), gifts (d(cid:2)na), dissension (bheda) and
war (yuddha)—which are also alluded to in 7.107-9 and 7.159, and
discussed at some length in KA 2.10.47ff. These issues will be ex-
plored in greater detail later.
Leaving aside the developments in rules of jurisprudence—which are
of less importance since they throw little light on the problem of (cid:2)pad
as it manifests in the (cid:2)DhP—and the references relating to raja-
dharma, much of this expanding corpus of rules is consistent with the
analysis we have already applied to the dharmas(cid:6)tras. The over-
whelming concern is still to balance the proper conduct (dharma,
karman) of people as it relates to their varõa, their gender, and so on,
conduct that underpins the social order and therefore maintains the
order of the cosmos, with the demands of living in a time or place that
makes normative rules difficult to follow. The parameters are ‘subjec-
tive’ and a time of distress is discussed for the most part only in terms
of the individual: the legitimate grounds for people to survive through
the adoption of abnormal conduct, or conduct proper to others, with-
out allowing the separate social categories that maintain world order
to collapse into each other. This point is worth emphasising, since,
while the rules for distress are abnormative, their proper concern is,
paradoxically, normative. These ‘dharmas for a time of distress’
((cid:2)paddharma)51 are rules designed to maintain the order of the world
when that order is itself at stake. This orientation, which I have called
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
describes a kingless state as a place where strong fish eat weaker fish, an allusion to
the well known notion of the ‘law of the fishes’ m(cid:2)tsyany(cid:2)ya. See also U.N. Ghoshal,

54 CHAPTER TWO
‘subjective’ and is defined in terms of the proper duties (svadharma)
of individuals, has the consequence of there being little in the way of
‘objective’ analyses of (cid:2)pad in the dharma literature, and a corre-
sponding lack of concern for how a time of (cid:2)pad can be turned
around, that is to say, how it can be made normal.52 Rather, an ‘objec-
tive’ approach to what constitutes a calamity, that goes beyond a
minimal definition of the type ‘when one’s own dharma cannot be
fulfilled’, the principal position of the texts on dharma, is found in a
work of a different locus and subject, that of the conduct of the king.
For the ‘objective’ vagaries of what constitutes a calamity, and of how
to manage a kingdom in response to such calamities, is especially a
king’s problem.
2.2 The Artha(cid:5)(cid:3)stra
There is a wealth of material in the KA on the topic of ‘distress’ or
‘calamities’, and a full account of it all shall not be attempted here;
rather the following gives only a taste of its approach in order to indi-
cate the general orientation of the KA to the problem, and its dif-
ferences and similarities in comparison the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition and
the (cid:2)DhP. If the concern of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras was to provide norma-
tive rules, delivered by and largely for br(cid:3)hmans, for the conduct of
people in respect to social class, firstly in a manner which we might
call ‘socio-religious’ (for want of a better word), and then developing
progressively in their comprehensiveness and jurisprudential charac-
ter,53 the KA is their counterpoint,54 being concerned to instruct the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
52 An exception occurs in the discussion of niyoga (see p.50 above), which defines
the problem (the (cid:2)pad) as an inability to produce an heir, and gives as a solution the
appointment (niyoga) of a substitute to provide the ‘seed’. The concern of the passage
is to somehow maintain the normality of the relationship between the mother-to-be
and the substitute-to-be whilst patently breaking the boundaries of that relationship.
Hence some appointments are restricted more than others (9.58), a man ‘silent and
smeared with butter’ (a protective or purifying unction? A lubricant?) can only be a
substitute for one child (9.60, though cf. the counter position in 9.61), afterwards they
should behave toward each like a guru (guruvat) and daughter-in-law (snuù(cid:2)vat), and
will ‘fall’ if they ignore the rule and behave lustfully (k(cid:2)mataþ). It is almost as if they
are not having sex at all.

of Political Science, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1993; Kangle, The Kauñil(cid:5)ya, vol.3; for
a unique attempt to date the text and a discussion of the identity of Kauñilya and the
(cid:3)

king in how to protect and increase the prosperity of a kingdom.55 As
with the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, the particular orientation of the KA deter-
mines how it deals with the topic of distress, and can be understood in
terms of how to avoid or prepare for distress, how to rescue the king-
dom from distress and how to take advantage of another’s distress. In
order to establish which of these procedures a king should employ, he
must properly understand the nature of a crisis, hence another charac-
teristic of the KA is for it to enumerate different types of crises and
assess their attributes, a characteristic in accordance with its stated
method of ‘methodical inquiry’ ((cid:2)nv(cid:5)kùik(cid:5)).56 In distinction from the
dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, therefore, ‘distress’ in the KA can be said to be ana-
lysed from an ‘objective’ perspective.57
2.2.1 The Artha(cid:5)(cid:3)stra and the dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stras
It is quite probable that the KA provides the most comprehensive
treatment of the notion of ‘distress’ or ‘calamity’ in Sanskrit literature.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
myths that surround him, see Trautmann, Kauñilya and the Artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra: A Statistical
Investigation of the Authorship and Evolution of the Text, Leiden: Brill, 1971.
55 Cf. KA 1.1.1 p(cid:8)thivy(cid:2) l(cid:2)bhe p(cid:2)lane ca y(cid:2)vanty artha(cid:3)(cid:2)str(cid:2)õi p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)c(cid:2)ryaiþ pra-

on politics was created having compiled almost as many political (cid:3)(cid:2)stras as were
promulgated by the ancient teachers for the purpose of the acquisition and protection
of the earth.’ KA 1.4.3 (cid:2)nv(cid:5)kùik(cid:5)tray(cid:5)v(cid:2)rtt(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü yogakùemas(cid:2)dhano daõóas tasya n(cid:5)tir

pratip(cid:2)dan(cid:5) ca || ‘The daõóahe epitome of is the means for the acquisition and pres-
ervation of methodical inquiry, the three Vedas and economics, its guidance is the
science of administration (daõóan(cid:5)ti), having for its purpose the acquisition of things
not possessed, the preservation of things possessed, the augmentation of things pre-
served, and the bestowal of things augmented on a worthy person.’ Cf. MS 7.99, 101,
and Scharfe, Investigations, pp.46f. for other parallels including RDhP 59.57.
56 KA 1.2.11. Thus J.C. Heesterman, “Kauñalya and the Ancient Indian State,”
WZKS, 15 (1971), pp.7ff., sees the principal aim of the KA to teach methods of “de-
bate that should lead to the right decision”. In this way its “seemingly pedantic enu-
merations and definitions fall into their proper places as aids towards articulate de-
bate”. That is to say, the KA reflects a pedagogic method. On (cid:2)nv(cid:5)kùik(cid:5) in the KA and
in other Indian traditions, see Halbfass, India and Europe, pp.273ff.
57 I employ the terms ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ to draw out a distinction be-
tween the traditions of dharma- and artha-(cid:3)(cid:2)stra in their perceptions of, and methods
of dealing with, a situation of ‘(cid:2)pad’. By describing it as ‘objective’ I do not mean
that the KA conains an empirical description of ruling. Ghoshal’s view (A History,
p.82) that it is an “inductive investigation of the phenomena of the State” is quite off
the mark in this respect (cf. I.W. Mabbett, Truth, Myth and Politics in Ancient India,
New Delhi, 1972, p.43); one ought rather to think of it as a model of deductive rea-
soning, in which general rules can be applied to specific ‘real life’ situations.
56 CHAPTER TWO
Indeed, it takes in such diverse aspects, to name only a few, as ‘di-
vine’ calamities like fire or famine, insurgency within the kingdom, or
the sickness of the king. However, it is important to state at the outset,
that the KA does not describe its concerns in terms of ‘(cid:2)paddharma’.
Its approach reflects a pragmatic appraisal of the contingencies of a
kingdom; the problem of how individuals might cope with these con-
tingencies barely figures in this appraisal. It is notable, for example,
that in a section detailing the proper duties (svadharma) of each varõa
and (cid:2)(cid:3)rama (1.3.4-17), there is no mention at all of how these may
alter in a time of distress. Indeed, the problem of the loss of liveli-
hood, which we identified as the manner in which the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra
tradition conceptualises the problem of distress, is mentioned only
rarely. One example relates only loosely to our topic, though it high-
lights one of the principal responsibilities of the king (7.6.31): a per-
son can desert his ‘master’ (sv(cid:2)mi—i.e. the king58) when he does not
provide a livelihood (av(cid:8)tti) for him. A second, in KA 8.4.7, is more
pertinent. In a typically Kauñilyan comparison of the relative merits of
famine (durbhikùa) and disease (vy(cid:2)dhi), famine is worse, according
to Kauñilya, because it ‘afflicts the whole country’ (sarvade(cid:3)ap(cid:5)óana)
and leads to the ‘loss of people’s livelihoods’ (pr(cid:2)õin(cid:2)m aj(cid:5)van(cid:2)ya).
A final example (KA 3.4.30) states that a woman in ‘distress’ can re-
marry ‘for the purpose of a livelihood’ (j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rtha). These are isolated
and certainly undeveloped expressions of the problem as it is formu-
lated in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition.
There are, however, two general ways in which the KA resembles
the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras’ treatment of the problem of distress. The first is in
the KA’s discussions of legal topics. The second, a mere formal re-
semblance in some of the phrasing. To mention some examples of the
first case, we find rules bearing on the invalidity of contracts (vya-
v(cid:2)hara)59 undertaken by those in a calamity (vyasana) or in distress
((cid:2)rta);60 the worthlessness of statements of witnesses when in distress
(vyasanin);61 the remarriage of a woman when in distress ((cid:2)padgata)
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
58 Sv(cid:2)mi is used because the desertion is by someone close to the king, as in his at-
tendants (bh(cid:8)tya) or allies (mitra). Cf. Scharfe, Investigations, pp.105f.; Scharfe, The
State, pp.78f.
59 On vyavah(cid:2)ra an ‘agreement [made in front of] witnesses’ (KA 3.1.40 vyava-
h(cid:2)ras tu s(cid:2)kùiùu), see Scharfe, Investigations, pp.197f.
60 KA 3.1.12-13. Cf. YS 2.32, BP 1.1.123, and MS 8.163, see p.51 above.
61 KA 3.1.34. Cf. MS 8.67. See p.51 above.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 57
for the purpose of a livelihood (j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rtha);62 and, as a final example, a
fine applies for an article sold but not delivered, ‘except in cases of
defect [in the product], a sudden calamity or unsuitability’.63 In defin-
ing these last three situations, in 3.15.3 Kauñilya describes ‘a sudden
calamity’ as trouble (b(cid:2)dha) from ‘the king, a thief, fire, or water’
(r(cid:2)jacor(cid:2)gnyudaka). There are only rare, and somewhat later, occur-
rences in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras of anything like this kind of definition
that is indicative of the KA, and even these are more limited in scope
than this relatively minor instance.64
The last of these examples illustrates the second resemblance be-
tween the two traditions, a mere formal similarity between construc-
tions of the an(cid:2)padi type discussed above (p.49), and exceptions to
rules stated in the KA with anyatra followed by the excepted situa-
tions in the ablative case. For example: sovereignty should be passed
to the eldest except when there is a calamity (anyatr(cid:2)padaþ;65 superin-
tendents (adhyakùa) must not carry out any work without informing
the king (anivedya bhartuþ) excepting measures against calamities
(anyatr(cid:2)patpratik(cid:2)rebhyaþ);66 those who cut forest produce should
pay a tax (deya), or a penalty (atyaya, in the case of not paying their
dues), except when they are in distress (anyatr(cid:2)padbhyaþ);67 a farmer
should pay a share of uncultivated land (anavasitabh(cid:2)ga) as desired
by the king, except when there is distress (anyatrak(cid:8)cchrebhyaþ);68
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
62 KA 3.4.30. Cf. also NS 12.97, PS 4.30.
63 KA 3.15.1, … anyatra doùopanip(cid:2)t(cid:2)viùahyebhyaþ | The rule is repeated from
the perspective of the purchaser in 3.15.9.
64 Cf. YS 2.256 r(cid:2)jadaivopagh(cid:2)tena paõye doùam up(cid:2)gate | h(cid:2)nir vikretur ev(cid:2)sau
y(cid:2)citasy(cid:2)prayacchataþ || ‘When trade is retarded, whether due to a royal or divine
obstruction, there is ruin for the seller who is solicited but unable to give.’ The notion
of a ‘calamity’ of royal or divine origin (r(cid:2)jadaivika) does occur on a number of occa-
sion in the later (cid:3)(cid:2)stras (cf. YS 2.113, 197; NS 3.6; KS 463 (= YS 2.113), 598; BP
1.19.40-1), yet none go into the detail characteristic of the KA.
65 KA 1.17.52.
66 KA 2.9.7.
67 KA 2.17.3. Kangle (The Kauñil(cid:5)ya., vol.2, p.129) explains “when no charges are
recovered”. Presumably he means when the harvester of the forest produce has not
obtained a payment for his goods. But perhaps also other crises where produce might
be limited, like fire or flood? Cf. also 5.2.6 where the king, when replenishing his
depleted treasury (arthak(cid:8)cchra), should exempt forest produce (araõyaj(cid:2)ta) from any
increase in tax.
68 KA 2.24.17. Kangle points out that this could mean either ‘when the state is in
distress, concessions may be withdrawn’ or ‘when the farmers are in distress, they
may be exempted from giving any share’. The difference is crucial, for in the first
case farmers are taxed more heavily. Kangle prefers the first, noting that the com-
pound arthak(cid:8)cchra, ‘difficulties in respect to money’, also occurrs in 5.2.1 in the
(cid:3)
58 CHAPTER TWO
and as a final example, a fine of one hundred paõas (coins) is imposed
on someone who gives shelter to another man’s wife, except in dis-
tress (anyatr(cid:2)padbhyaþ).69
2.2.2 Artha(cid:5)(cid:3)stra analyses
The procedure of the analytical assessment of the qualities of a person,
a consitituent of the state or the place or time for any particular activ-
ity, such as a military raid or invasion, is a striking feature of the
KA.70 Unsurprisingly, such analyses frequently cite the desirable at-
tributes of the person or thing being assesessed in the face of ‘calami-
ties’. The purohita (‘chaplain’71), for example, one of various appoint-
ees a king must make to his court, is described in the following way
(KA 1.9.9):
purohitam uditoditakula(cid:3)(cid:5)laü s(cid:2)ïge vede daive nimitte daõóan(cid:5)ty(cid:2)ü
c(cid:2)bhivin(cid:5)tam (cid:2)pad(cid:2)ü daivam(cid:2)nuù(cid:5)õ(cid:2)m atharvabhir up(cid:2)yai(cid:3) ca prati-
kart(cid:2)raü kurv(cid:5)ta ||
He [the king] should appoint a purohita whose conduct and family are
very exalted, who is well versed in the Vedas with their auxiliaries, in
divine signs, in omens, in the science of administration, and who can
rectify divine or human calamities through atharvan strategies.
The (cid:3)(cid:2)strins deeply appreciated the contingencies of a kingdom and
left little unconsidered in anticipating circumstances that might affect
its prosperity. Thus almost every aspect of the kingdom, from the
royal residence through to the characteristics of allies and enemies, is
subjected to this kind of analysis, frequently with reference to their
attributes ‘in crises’. The royal residence (antaþpura) should have es-
cape routes and hiding places for the purpose of counteracting calami-
ties, or for when a calamity has occurred ((cid:2)patprat(cid:5)k(cid:2)r(cid:2)rtham (cid:2)padi
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
section on the replenishment of the treasury. In support of Kangle’s view, section 5.2
prescribes increases in tax or the application of a special tax in order to replenish the
treasury in preparation for a time of distress, and then more extreme measures in the
case of distress (cf. Scharfe, Investigations, pp.161ff.). Cf. also Kangle’s note to 5.2.1,
p.296; and Scharfe, The State, pp.144f.
69 KA 3.4.7. For others examples, see 3.9.32, 3.11.13, 3.16.30
70 See page 55 note 56 above.
71 On the purohita in the KA see Scharfe, Investigations, pp.137f. On the basis of
the KA one could only agree with Lingat (The Classical Law, p.217) that ‘chaplain’ is
inadequate for the multiplicity of the purohita’s function, at least as we think of chap-
lains in contemporary times. Cf. Scharfe, The State, pp.112-18 for other references.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 59
ca);72 between settling land occupied by disunited people (bhinna-
manuùya) or men in bands ((cid:3)ren(cid:5)manuùya), the former is better be-
cause it is more profitable (bhogya), others cannot rouse the people to
rebellion (anupaj(cid:2)pya), but, on the other hand, such land is unable to
cope with calamities (an(cid:2)patsaha);73 and one of the many qualities of
elephants is their ability to protect in a crisis (vyasane tr(cid:2)õam).74
In the above examples ‘distress’ is referred to as one incidental fea-
ture amongst many other elements. But the KA also has chapters in
which crises ((cid:2)pad, vyasana) of one kind or another receive more de-
tailed examination. The table in FIGURE 6 provides a list of those sec-
tions where the notions of ‘distress’, ‘calamity’ or ‘disaster’ account
for a significant degree of the material, though it does not exhaust the
KA’s treatment of such matters. I have included all three kinds of di-
vision found in the KA: books, chapters and prakaraõas, ‘topics’.75 I
have also included the titles of book eight which devotes itself entirely
to the problem of the calamities (vyasana) of the state.
The KA’s predilection for analytical assessment—whether this be
the extent of a risk, or the ability of a king in any particular situation
to attain a certain goal, or some similar exercise—is again on display
in these chapters, as is suggested by the number of topic titles includ-
ing words like ‘consideration’ (cint(cid:2)) (108, 128) and ‘categories’
(varga). Once the calamity is identified the chapters tend to orient
themselves in one or more of the three ways mentioned earlier: avoid-
ing the crisis, overcoming the crisis or taking advantage of a crisis
when it occurs to another. In the following a general overview of the
KA’s ‘analytical’ technique is given, followed by a discussion of two
particular foci of its approach.76

75 The topic titles are found in KA 1.1.1, at the beginning of each chapter, and in
the colophons at the end of each chapter. On the titles, chapter and topic divisions,
which pose some problems, see L. Renou, “Les divisions dans les textes Sanskrits,”

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 61
A good point to begin with is the distinction in KA 8.1.2 between
calamities of divine (daiva) and human (m(cid:2)nuùam) origin.77 In the
former case, a calamity (vyasana) that befalls a constituent of the state
(prak(cid:8)ti) is due to bad luck (anaya), but it is due to bad policy (apa-
naya) in the latter.78 While divine calamities are enumerated a number
of times, there is no comparable list of those of human origin, though
to infer them from the copious material on calamities is not a difficult
matter, an obvious example being the various ‘conspiracies’ ((cid:2)pad)79
that spring from officers in outer regions and the interior (9.5). In fact
the latter’s connection to the distinction drawn in KA 8.1.2 is quite
explicit, since such conspiracies are said to arise from bad policy
(apanaya), precisely the stated origin of ‘human calamities’ in 8.1.2.80
KA 4.3, ‘countermeasures against calamities’ (upanip(cid:2)taprat(cid:5)-
k(cid:2)ra), contains the most extensive treatment of ‘divine calamities’. It
enumerates the ‘eight great dangers of divine origin’ (daiv(cid:2)ny a(cid:3)ñau
mah(cid:2)bhay(cid:2)ni): fire, floods (udaka), disease (vy(cid:2)dhi), famine (dur-
bhikùa), rats or mice (m(cid:6)ùika), wild animals (vy(cid:2)la), snakes (sarpa)
and demons (rakùas). KA 8.4.1 lists similar ‘divine afflictions’ (daiva-
p(cid:5)óana): fire, floods, disease, famine and epidemic (maraka). And
finally, 9.7.82 lists calamities ((cid:2)padaþ) caused by the gods (daiv(cid:2)d):
fire, floods, disease, epidemic (pram(cid:2)ra),81 panic (vidrava), famine
and demonical creation.82 Of this latter citation, Kangle’s says in a
note to his translation, “Strictly speaking fire, floods, etc. are p(cid:5)óanas
(8.4), hardly (cid:2)pads.” But he is clearly incorrect in thinking these terms
should necessarily designate different kinds of distressful situations.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
77 Cf. Wilhelm, “Calamities,” p.622 (mistakenly refers to 7.1.2 instead of 8.1.2).
78 This follows from 6.2.6: m(cid:2)nuùaü nay(cid:2)panayau daivam ay(cid:2)nayau || ‘Human
[acts] are good policy or bad policy, divine [acts] good luck or bad luck.’
79 On (cid:2)pad as conspiracy here, see Kangle, The Kauñil(cid:5)ya, vol.2, p.420.
80 9.5.1-2 saüdhy(cid:2)d(cid:5)n(cid:2)m ayathodde(cid:3)(cid:2)vasth(cid:2)panam apanayaþ|| tasm(cid:2)d (cid:2)padaþ
sambhavanti|| ‘Not using peace and so on [i.e. the ùaóguõya in book 7] as directed is
wrong policy. Due to this, conspiracies arise.’ Cf. also 9.7.1.
81 Literally ‘dying’, this must mean the ‘dying’ of people on a large scale, hence I
agree with Kangle (The Kauñil(cid:5)ya, vol.2, p.432) who take this as a synonym for
maraka. They are, of course, derived from the same root. Cf. Scharfe, Investigations,
p.94. On the ‘calamity of epidemics’, cf. Caraka Saühit(cid:2) 3.3; see also D. Wujastyk,
The Roots of Ayurveda, New Delhi: Penguin, 2003, pp.38ff.
82 Without explanation, Kangle (ibid.) says of (cid:2)sur(cid:5) s(cid:8)ùñi, “rats, serpents, spirits,
etc.”, perhaps in an effort to gloss the difference between the lists in 4.3.1 and here.
But then Wilhelm, “Calamities,” p.624 (who refers to this s(cid:6)tra as 9.7.72), cites the
commentator Gaõapati as giving the same explanation. Feasibly, however, it could
mean all kinds of demonic beings and hence may be synonymous with rakùas.
62 CHAPTER TWO
Words for ‘calamity’ are, rather, frequently used synonymously, as we
find in these three citations.83 However, the fact that there are three
different lists suggests the correctness of the view that the KA under-
went some transformation in its textual history.84 The treatment in 4.3
is by far the most comprehensive, the daivap(cid:5)óanas in 8.4 being
quickly passed over in eight s(cid:6)tras before the KA moves on to other
p(cid:5)óanas. Kangle thinks 4.3 a strange inclusion in Book 4, which is
concerned with kaõñaka(cid:3)odhana, a term he translates as ‘the suppres-
sion of criminals’, but which literally means ‘the removal of thorns’,
the broader connotation of which would be more accommodating to
4.3, a point Kangle himself makes.85 On the other hand, the other
chapters in this book clearly refer to criminal behaviour, which sup-
ports Kangle’s suspicion. Similarly both Kangle and Scharfe argue
that 9.7.82 is a redundant inclusion, treating a topic covered more
comprehensively elsewhere and being included in a chapter to which
it bears little direct relevance.86 The list in KA 9.7.82 is followed only
by a s(cid:6)tra that prescribes prostration before gods and br(cid:3)hmans as a
means to overcome these calamities, and then a stanza suggesting
(cid:2)tharvan rites and ‘undertakings by holy men’,87 means that are remi-
niscent of the requirement of the purohita, which we cited above
(p.58), to be able to act ‘against divine or human calamities through
atharvan strategies’.
The more thorough treatment of the topic in both chapters 4.3 and
8.4 is instructive for understanding the KA’s method. KA 4.3 exam-
ines various practical and ritualised ‘magical’ methods to prepare for
and counteract divine calamities, a responsibility that seems primarily
the king’s to manage if he is taken as the implied subject of 4.3.2,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
83 An error noted also by Wilhelm, “Calamities,” p.624. Cf. also KA 4.3.44 in
which the compound daiv(cid:2)patpratik(cid:2)rinaþ is clearly meant to be synonymous with
the title of the prakaraõa, upanip(cid:2)taprat(cid:5)k(cid:2)ra, and also with daiv(cid:2)ny aùñau mah(cid:2)-
bhay(cid:2)ni found in 4.3.1. In this case Kangle expresses no concern over the use of (cid:2)pad.
Similarly Kangle fails to note that in the p(cid:5)óanavarga of 8.4 all kinds of afflictions are
listed, not just the ‘divine’ such as drought and so on.
84 See e.g. Trautmann, Kauñilya and the Artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra, passim, esp. pp.174ff. Cf.
Scharfe, Investigations, p.76, who sees “… Kauñalya as an author on a par with
Vy(cid:3)sa, Agastya, N(cid:3)rada, etc., even if his character might be modelled after an histori-
cal person”.

which recommends that ‘he should protect the country from them’.88
KA 4.3.6, for example, says that in the rainy season ‘villagers at the
water’s edge’ ((cid:2)n(cid:6)pagr(cid:2)ma) should live away from the level of the
floods,89 should collect planks, bamboos and boats (4.3.7), and are
compelled to rescue those being carried away by the water under pain
of a fine (4.3.8-9). At the same time the king (or pradeùñ(cid:8)) must make
them worship the rivers on parvan (new and full moon) days and the
‘experts in the practice of magic’ (m(cid:2)y(cid:2)yogavidaþ) or ‘knowers of the
Veda’ should make spells against the rain (varùam abhicareyuþ). This
combination of practical measures, magical rites and worship, is typi-
cal for all of the calamities listed, which are treated one after the other,
except in the case of drought where worship is the only remedy given
(4.3.12).90 Occasionally there is a specific reference to spells delivered
by ‘knowers of the Atharvaveda’ (4.3.37, 40) and those who are ‘ex-
perts in the practice of magic’ (4.3.40, 44).
As already noted, the divine calamities in chapter 8.4 are dealt with
rather quickly. This chapter consists of three prakaraõas, ‘the cate-
gory of affliction’, ‘the category of hindrances’ and ‘the category of
misappropriations from the treasury’ (see FIGURE 6 above),91 the latter
two occupying just a s(cid:6)tra each (8.4.48 and 49 respectively). Begin-
ning with the daivap(cid:5)óanas, the chapter quickly progresses to other
kinds of afflictions. In a method typical of the KA, two p(cid:5)óanas are
compared to elucidate the worse of the two. A view attributed to ‘the
teachers’ ((cid:2)c(cid:2)rya) is put forward, followed by the opposing (correct)
view given by Kauñilya. Clearly many of these afflictions could be
considered calamities of human origin, as these examples indicate:

in arguing that janapada refers to the people and the land. The implied subject for
most of book 4 is the pradeùñ(cid:8), whose duty is the ‘removal of thorns’ (on whom see
Scharfe, Investigations, pp.168ff.), but, as Kangle notes, in 4.3 it often seems that the
king is meant to direct the operations himself. Even if it is the pradeùñ(cid:8), he does so at
the behest of the king.

‘Of thieves and forest tribes,92 thieves operate under cover of night and
always attack men’s bodies, rob hundreds of thousands [in money], and
enrage important men; [while] forest tribes, separated, operating in for-
ests on frontier borders, operate openly and conspicuously, and strike
only one area,’ say the teachers. ‘No,’ says Kauñilya. ‘Thieves rob only
the negligent, are few in number, stupid, easy to know and capture;
[while] forest tribes live in their own territory, are many in number and
courageous, fight openly, rob and strike areas, and have the qualities of
kings.’
This section’s inclusion of p(cid:5)óanas of both divine and human origin
indicates that for the king the first task is to assess the danger of the
‘calamity’ in order to counteract it, though for the countermeasures we
must look in other areas of the KA (e.g. 4.3). But we perhaps should
not conclude that these type of analyses merely function to provide
information of the sort ‘this is worse than that’ and descriptions of the
various qualities of each element. As Heesterman has suggested, there
is much to be learnt from the method itself in “logical argumentation
and the proper handling of discussion on questions of statecraft”.93
Rather than being a manual that thoroughly explores all contingencies,
the KA is pedagogical: it relates a method for dealing with whatever
contingency might arise. Thus the quotations from ‘the teachers’
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

probably ‘members of the forest tribe’, see Scharfe, Investigations, p.184.

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 65
should not necessarily be viewed as the actual views of other pre-
Kauñilyan authorities, as some seem to understand them,94 but rather
as devices facilitating the method.95
We see a similar method operating in 8.1, the first of the chapters
dealing exclusively with vyasana. The analysis in this case is of the
seven constituents of the state: the king (sv(cid:2)mi), minister (am(cid:2)tya),
country (janapada), fort (durga), treasury (ko(cid:3)a), army (daõóa) and
ally (mitra), outlined already in 6.1.96 Some statements just prior to
this analysis provide reasons for it being undertaken in the first place.
It begins in 8.1.1: ‘In the case of simultaneity of calamities, one
should march or guard oneself according to what is more practicable,
hence this consideration of calamities.’97 KA 8.1.2, which has already
been mentioned above (p.61), gives a basic taxonomy of both the
cause and origin of the calamity of a constituent, while 8.1.3 provides
a general definition of the ways a disaster can befall the constituents:
an ‘inversion of [their] qualities’ (guõapr(cid:2)tilomya),98 their non-
existence (abh(cid:2)va), a ‘great defect’ (pradoùa) in them, addictions
(prasaïga, presumably applies to humans only99) and afflictions (p(cid:5)ó(cid:2),
i.e. 8.4). An etymologising definition of vyasana follows in 8.1.4: ‘It
throws (vyasyati) a constituent (enam) out from its best state ((cid:3)reyas),
thus it is called vyasana.’100 A view from ‘the teachers’ is then cited,
according to which the calamity of each prior constituent is more seri-
ous than the latter, a view contradicted by Bh(cid:3)radv(cid:3)ja, beginning a
pattern that continues to the end of the chapter. Each constituent is
contrasted with the one before it and after it, first in a quote from a
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
94 E.g. Ghoshal, A History, pp.81ff. Some of the views may well have been those
of predecessors, or even contemporaries, of Kauñilya. But this seems to miss the fabri-
cated nature of these disputes, which is even clearer in other sections.
95 Cf. Scharfe, Investigations, pp.184-5, who does not, however, discuss the kind
of observation made by Heesterman.

98 The qualities (guõas) of each constituent are given in 6.1.
99 Kangle, The Kauñil(cid:5)ya, vol.2, p.383 note to 8.1.3. This possibly refers to the
vices of men (puruùavyasana), the topic of 8.3.
100 The antecedent of the pronoun enam is unclear. If it refers to prak(cid:8)ti, as I have
taken it, then this involves problems for gender. Kangle translates: “It throws a person
out from his good, hence it is called vyasana.” However, the passage clearly refers to
the constituents, and the constituents are not always people. The pronoun may perhaps
be understood to function deictically with the constituents listed in 8.1.5.
66 CHAPTER TWO
named sage which reverses the order found in 8.1.5, then in a counter
argument by Kauñilya, whose view, of course, is the correct one, reaf-
firming the order found in 8.1.5. This passage contains the elements
highlighted in the beginning of the discussion on the KA: the given
problem refers to a situation where both the king and his enemy are
experiencing a crisis, and hence by establishing whose is worse, the
king will know whether to march against his enemy and take ad-
vantage of whatever crisis has befallen him, or stay and protect him-
self against the enemy taking advantage of his own crisis. Even if it is
possible that these views may have been stated before by predecessors
of Kauñilya,101 the argument in the text is a fabrication, a ‘false dialec-
tic’. The fact that each comparison is enunciated by a different sage is
only the most obvious indication of this. The point is, rather, to pro-
vide Kauñilya with a platform to demonstrate not just the relative im-
portance of each constituent, but also the importance of each constitu-
ent in itself. Such an understanding is necessary, of course, in order to
appreciate both why one should protect or save one’s own constituents
from a crisis, and to assess whether an enemy’s crisis is worse than
one’s own. This, too, is an indication of the kind of thinking for which
the KA has often been compared to Machiavelli,102 in as much as an
enemy’s weakness is conceived as an opportunity for a king’s ad-
vancement;103 the rule of interstate relations so often seems to be ‘eat
or be eaten’, a recurring motif in Indian conceptions of politics.
The calamities of each of the constituents as laid out in 8.1 are dis-
cussed at various stages of the KA, and many of these are found
throughout book 8 which is concerned exclusively with the topic of
vyasanas. These analyses place in sharp relief the treatment of the
same set of problems in the texts on dharma. A crisis or situation of
distress is conceptualised in state terms, in its impact on the kingdom
as a whole and on its elements as part of that whole. The problem is
always considered in terms of expedience: how to survive if a crisis
has struck one’s own kingdom and how to gain if it strikes an-

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 67
other’s.104 Thus, as with so much else of the KA, the discussion of cri-
ses demonstrates a concern with the relations between stronger and
weaker kings, a concern it shares with the (cid:2)DhP; the KA analyses
both positions, of course, since it gives advice for a king in any of a
large number of possible scenarios.
Before turning to some specific instances in which the KA demon-
strates parallel concerns with the (cid:2)DhP, a brief discussion of KA 8.3
is in order, because it highlights some of the key differences between
the KA and other texts. This chapter is entirely devoted to the vices
that a king must avoid. But this is not expressed in terms of them be-
ing in breach of dharma, as might be expected in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras
or even in the Mbh, but because it threatens the kingdom. The chapter
begins by relating their origin: the vyasanas arise from anger (kopa)
and lust (k(cid:2)ma), and their cause is the absence of training in the sci-
ences (avidy(cid:2)vinaya).105 The seven vices (four from anger, three from
lust) are then analysed in the typically Kauñilyan ‘comparative’ and
‘dialectical’ mode that we have seen before. Two stanzas closing the
chapter nicely illustrate the point being addressed here (8.3.65-6):
asat(cid:2)ü pragrahaþ k(cid:2)maþ kopa(cid:3) c(cid:2)vagrahaþ sat(cid:2)m|
vyasanaü doùab(cid:2)huly(cid:2)d atyantam ubhayaü matam||

parityajen m(cid:6)laharaü v(cid:8)ddhasev(cid:5) jitendriyaþ||
Lust is the favouring of bad people, anger the suppression of the good.
Both are considered calamities (vices?) without end because of the mul-
titude of evils [that arise from them]. Therefore, a prudent [king] should
serve his elders and control his senses and avoid anger and lust, the
starting point of the calamities (vices?) which destroy his base.106
I have included the bracketed alternative to ‘calamity’ for vyasana to
indicate the inherent ambiguity in this term, since in both instances it
would make perfect sense translated as vice, though this would miss
the implication that the translation ‘calamity’ draws out: vices, espe-
cially when found in the king, are threatening to the kingdom. They
are, in fact, calamitous.

following the commentary Nayacandrik(cid:2).
68 CHAPTER TWO
Attention shall now be devoted to two topics which are of particular
significance because they are dealt with in a similar manner in both
the KA and the (cid:2)DhP. The first of these concerns the treasury (ko(cid:3)a),
and the second the KA’s attitude towards the weaker king. Both of
these elements are evident in the opening pra(cid:3)nas of the (cid:2)DhP.107 The
topic of the treasury (ko(cid:3)a) or wealth (dhana) creation forms much of
the content of three of the texts discussed below (RDhP 128, (cid:2)DhP
131 and (cid:2)DhP 134), while the problems incurred by the ‘weaker king’
are also a recurrent motif, as we shall see later, and in many ways
could also be seen as the problematic which informs the entire KA.
2.2.3 The treasury ‘ko(cid:5)a’
The importance of the treasury108 is underlined frequently in the KA.
Sutra 6.1.1 lists it among the seven constituents of the state, and later
it is stated that it should be acquired through dharma and be able to
endure a crisis even when there has been no income for a long period
of time (d(cid:5)rgh(cid:2)m apy (cid:2)padam an(cid:2)yatiü saheta).109 In his assessment
of the relative importance of the constituents in 8.1,110 Kauñilya argues
that a crisis (vyasana) of the treasury is more important than that of
the army, ‘for the army has its foundation in the treasury’ (ko(cid:3)am(cid:6)lo
hi daõóaþ).111 The treasury is the means (hetu) of dharma and k(cid:2)ma,
and promotes all material wealth (sarvadravyaprayojakatva).112 KA
2.8.1 states that ‘all undertakings precede from the treasury’ (ko(cid:3)a-
p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)þ sarv(cid:2)rambh(cid:2)þ).113 A crisis of the treasury is simply understood
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
107 See below, pp.190ff. and 211ff.

109 KA 6.1.10. I follow Kangle’s translation of (cid:2)yati as ‘income, revenue’, see
vol.2, p.316 and p.128 note to 2.16.12. Presumably it is connected with (cid:2)ya. On reve-
nue see also 2.6; 2.5.1-4 discusses the building of a treasury (ko(cid:3)ag(cid:8)ha), see especially
the last s(cid:6)tra, which states that the director of stores (saünidh(cid:2)t(cid:8)) should have a per-
manent treasury built for a time of distress on the edge of the country by those con-
demned to death (janapad(cid:2)nte dhruvanidhim (cid:2)padartham abhityaktaiþ k(cid:2)rayet). See
also Kangle’s notes (vol.2, p.72) on the vocabulary in this s(cid:6)tra. On this practice of
‘hoarding’, see Mabbett, Truth, Myth, pp.105f.

as ‘misappropriations from the treasury’ (ko(cid:3)asaïga),114 resulting, of
course, in its depletion. These misappropriations occur due to ‘the in-
ternal impediments of chiefs and the external impediments of enemies
and tribes’ ((cid:2)bhyantaro mukhyastambho b(cid:2)hyo ’mitr(cid:2)ñav(cid:5)stam-
bhaþ);115 the afflictions (p(cid:5)óanas) described in 8.4.1-46 (see above
pp.61ff.); misappropriation of its funds by chiefs (sakto mukhyeùu,
literally, ‘clinging to chiefs’); ‘weakness through exemptions’ (pari-
h(cid:2)ropahataþ); the treasury’s ‘dispersal’ or, perhaps, ‘squandering’
(prak(cid:5)rõo); ‘wrongful collection’ (mithy(cid:2)saüh(cid:8)taþ), and its being
‘seized by neighbouring kings or forest tribes’ (s(cid:2)mant(cid:2)ñav(cid:5)h(cid:8)ta).116
Furthermore, KA 2.8 provides a breakdown of the various ways in
which employees (yukta) cause the depletion of the treasury (ko(cid:3)a-
kùaya), and the fines and remedies against this.
Chapter 5.2, the prakaraõa ko(cid:3)(cid:2)bhisaüharaõam, ‘the replenish-
ment of the treasury,’117 details the various means by which a king
who is without a treasury (ako(cid:3)a), for whom ‘difficulties concerning
money have arisen’ (pratyutpann(cid:2)rthak(cid:8)cchra), should gather (saü-
g(cid:8)hõ(cid:5)y(cid:2)t) funds for the treasury. These measures become increasingly
more desperate and imaginative the further the chapter progresses.
Kauñilya begins with fairly mild measures. For example, the king
‘should demand a third or fourth share118 from a province, whether
large or small in size, that is not dependent on rains and yields abun-

117 There is some debate as to whether this passage refers to ordinary revenue rais-
ing or to emergency situations, for which see Scharfe, Investigations, pp.161ff.; Kan-
gle, vol.3 pp.189ff. I agree with both these scholars that it refers to an emergency
situation. See also Scharfe, The State, pp.144f.; U.N. Ghoshal, Contributions to the
History of the Hindu Revenue System, Calcutta, 1929, pp.167ff.; E.H. Johnston, “Two
Studies in the Artha(cid:5)(cid:3)stra of Kauñilya,” Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1929,
pp.97ff. Johnston says this “may be called an (cid:2)paddharma”, though it is not so called
here, and can only be so on reflection from the (cid:2)DhP and, less so, the MS, where the
connection is made explicit.
118 Cf. also MS 10.118; Hopkins, “The Social and Military Position,” pp.88ff.
Both Scharfe and Kangle follow Johnston, (“Two Studies,”) in taking this as an addi-
tional levy rather than an increase in tax, usually understood as ‘the sixth share’ (ùaó-
bh(cid:2)ga) of the king. On this and for other references see Scharfe, Investigations,
pp.161f. KA 2.1.36 says that any region within the kingdom that is ‘afflicted’ is ex-
empted from taxes.

dant crops; from a middling or inferior, according to yield’.119 Or, to
increase agricultural revenue, the state can attempt to stimulate the
economy by providing a new settler with grains, cattle, money and so
on.120 If these and other similar measures are not effective, ‘officers of
the administrator’ (sam(cid:2)hart(cid:8)puruùa) should take over the fields and
ensure their productivity (5.2.8-11). Similarly, the KA proposes in-
creasing levies on other sectors of the economy (5.2.17-29). But if
these fail, then he should ask town and country people (pauraj(cid:2)na-
pada) for contributions, first having ‘secret agents’ (yogapuruùa) offer
large amounts, providing the king with an example of the necessary
spirit of generosity with which he can induce others to follow.
Soon, however, the measures tend towards more extreme degrees
of deception and intrigue. Administrators should take for the treasury
the property of heretical groups (p(cid:2)ùaõóasaügha) or divine property
(devadravya)121 not used by br(cid:3)hmans (a(cid:3)rotriyopabhogya),122 and the
supervisor of temples (devat(cid:2)dhyakùa) should collect the treasuries of
temples in the fort (durga) and country (r(cid:2)ùñra). KA 5.2.39-45 sug-
gests various means of exploiting people’s religious sensibilities and
superstitions to convince them to give up their wealth, such as using
an agent ‘masquerading as a wise man’ (siddhavya(cid:9)jana)123 who, after
indicating the danger ‘from an evil demon in a tree demanding a tax of
one human being, should ward it off for the city and country people in
exchange for their money’.124 Various other agents, described in some
detail elsewhere (KA 1.11-12), are also recommended for amassing
wealth from different sources. An agent ‘masquerading as a merchant’
(vaidehakavya(cid:9)jana) ‘should amass wealth through deposits and loans
against the value of commodities, then [the king] should have him
robbed at night’.125 Similarly, he should loan or hire gold and silver

ornaments for sacrificial offerings (prahavaõanimitta),126 or take a
down-payment ((cid:8)õa) on goods he has displayed at a festival (sam(cid:2)je),
and then have them stolen during the night (KA 5.2.49-51). The most
devious means are reserved for those who are treasonous (d(cid:6)ùya) or
lack piety (adh(cid:2)rmika).127 Various methods which today might be
called entrapment are suggested in order to confiscate people’s wealth.
For example, ‘having seduced traitors with women pretending to be
honest, and having caught them in their very houses, they should take
all their property’.128 Other means involve playing two parties against
each other, as in 5.2.53-4: ‘when a dispute has arisen between families
of traitors, poison-givers should be dispatched to give poison; due to
that offence, the others should have their property taken’.129 And fi-
nally there are also a number of cases which involve simply the setting
up of a traitor for some kind of crime, as in 5.2.67, ‘while an agent
masquerading as a workman is doing work in a house, he should plant
the tools of a counterfeit coin maker or a thief; or an agent masquerad-
ing as a physician [should plant there] poison disguised as medi-
cine’.130 The point in these cases being, of course, to apprehend the
treacherous ‘offender’ and confiscate his wealth.
2.2.4 The weak king vs. the strong king
The problem posed for the weak king when faced by a strong king is
prominent in the (cid:2)DhP; many of its chapters and fables directly con-
cern it. Yet, while the (cid:2)DhP figures such a situation as an exemplary
case of crisis ((cid:2)pad), in the KA it constitutes one of many possible
scenarios within a larger conceptualisation that sees a king within a
nexus of relationships with other kings. The KA articulates this nexus
through the theory of the maõóala, in which neighboring kings are
analysed as either enemies or allies in relationship to a central king
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
126 On this I follow Scharfe rather than Kangle’s ‘on the occasion of a festive
party’, though see Kangle’s note to 1.10.9, vol.2, p.19.
127 While the d(cid:6)ùya is the object of the s(cid:6)tras from 5.2.52 through to 5.2.68,
5.2.69 makes these s(cid:6)tras applicable to an adh(cid:2)rmika as well.

(the vijig(cid:5)ùu, the king ‘who desires to conquer’), depending on their
strength, intentions and relationships to other members of the
maõóala.131 Even so, the KA clearly conceptualises the state of being a
weaker king as a situation of crisis in a way analogous to the (cid:2)DhP.
In a chapter on the ‘calamities of the king and his rule’ (rajar(cid:2)jya-
vyasana), KA 8.2.21-4 compares the merits of rule by a ‘weak king of
noble birth and a strong king of lowly birth’ (durbalo ’bhij(cid:2)to balav(cid:2)n
anabhij(cid:2)to r(cid:2)j(cid:2)); and in 12.1.3-4, which concerns the ‘weaker king’
((cid:2)bal(cid:5)yasa), Vi(cid:5)(cid:3)l(cid:3)kùa is reported to hold the view that, if attacked by
a stronger king, the weaker king ‘should fight with the mobilisation of
all troops’ (sarvasaüdohena bal(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü yudhyeta)132 ‘because courage
wards off a calamity’ (par(cid:2)kramo hi vyasanam apahanti).133 So while
the state of being a weaker king may be just one of the potential out-
comes of a nexus of relationships with other forces, it is obvious that
to avoid or extract oneself from this state was one of the goals of
n(cid:5)ti(cid:3)(cid:2)stra.134 As we saw in the comparative assessment of vyasanas in
KA 8.1 and in the words of Hartmut Scharfe, there was a “constant
struggle between self-preservation and expansion”.135 The KA, there-
fore, tends to speak of the weak (durbala, abala, h(cid:5)na(cid:3)akti, h(cid:5)na) king
as either the object of expansion (e.g. 6.2.16, 7.3.22, 7.10.26-7, 9.1.1),
or the subject of self-preservation, just as it does a king ‘in calamity’.
The KA deals with the topic of the weak king in a far more detailed
manner than the (cid:2)DhP, paying attention to a formidable range of vari-
able circumstances. This bears out the general distinction between the
(cid:2)DhP and the KA and, for that matter, between the latter and the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
131 See KA book 6. For discussions of the maõóala theory, which seems to have
multiple forms, and is perhaps a conflation of a number of different theories, see J.W.
Spellman, Political theory of ancient India: a study of Kingship from the earliest
times to circa A. D. 300, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964, pp.156ff.; Scharfe, Investi-

pp.248ff.; J.C. Heesterman, “Power, Priesthood, Authority,” in The Inner Conflict of
Tradition, pp.149f.; for cautionary remarks against understanding the maõóala theory
as representing a geographical situation as implied in the diagrams of Scharfe and
Spellman, see Mabbett, Truth, Myth, pp.38f. In my view, the maõóala theory ought to
be viewed as a pedagogical device.

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 73
RDhP as well. I will not attempt to describe in entirety the solutions
the KA suggests, but rather draw out the points I consider most salient
for the present purpose.
Emphasising the extent to which conflict between forces of unequal
and shifting power lies at the basis of the political vision of the KA,
the terms used to describe the actors are frequently compara-
tives—most often they apply to the stronger king, thus jy(cid:2)yas, bal(cid:5)yas,
balavattara, but occasionally also to the weaker, as with
(cid:2)bal(cid:5)yas—and, therefore, the manner in which to proceed is worked
out in the context of whether one is equivalent, weaker or stronger
(samah(cid:5)najy(cid:2)yas) in power when compared to other participants in the
conflict.136 The problems arising from encounters between these un-
equal forces are worked out within the context of strategy, and this is
most often expressed by one of two similar ideas: the group of four
strategies (up(cid:2)ya) or the group of six (ù(cid:2)óguõya). The former is first
found in KA 2.10.47-56 in the prakaraõa concerning edicts ((cid:3)(cid:2)sana),
and consists of ‘conciliation’ (s(cid:2)man), ‘generosity’ (upaprad(cid:2)na),
‘dissension’ (bheda) and ‘force’ (daõóa),137 while the latter has all of
book seven devoted to it (though, as we shall see, not to the exclusion
of the up(cid:2)yas), and consists of ‘treaty’ (saüdhi), ‘war’ (vigraha),
‘staying quiet’ ((cid:2)sana), ‘marching’ (y(cid:2)na), ‘seeking shelter’ (saü-
(cid:3)raya) and ‘duplicity’ (dvaidh(cid:5)bh(cid:2)v(cid:2)þ).138 There is some overlap be-
tween these two systems, though the application of the former is more
general, applying to internal policy as well as external.139 In this regard
we could cite the example of the crises ((cid:2)padaþ) discussed in KA 9.5-
7 (see FIGURE 6 above), at the end of which we find the four up(cid:2)yas
listed as the means to overcome them.140
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
136 E.g. KA 7.3.1-5. (Cf. MS 7.87.)
137 The four up(cid:2)yas are enumerated again in 9.6.56-61. Cf. also MS 7.107-9, 159,
198-200; RDhP 59.35 (adds upekù(cid:2), ‘indifference’), 69.23, 103.22 (cf. MS 7.198-
200), 104.35, 108.12 (cf. KA 9.5-7).
138 The ù(cid:2)óguõya is mentioned a number of times in the RDhP, e.g. 41.9, 57.16,
59.79, 82.29, 108.3, yet only enumerated in 69.64. Note that the up(cid:2)yas and the ù(cid:2)ó-
guõya occur in the same chapter on three occasions. Cf. also MS 7.160ff. On dvaidh(cid:5)-
bh(cid:2)va, which has caused some problems of interpretation and seems misunderstood
by Kangle, see Scharfe, The State, pp.208f.; and O. Botto, “Dvaidh(cid:8)bh(cid:3)va in the Kau-
ñil(cid:8)y(cid:3)rtha(cid:5)(cid:3)stra and in other texts,” in J. Ensink and P. Gaefke, India Maior (Con-

74 CHAPTER TWO
Material relating to this topic recurs through a number of the KA’s
chapters. While book 12, ‘on the weaker king’ ((cid:2)bal(cid:5)yasam), is of ob-
vious significance, material occurs elsewhere as well, though fre-
quently it is cross-referenced to book 12. KA 7.3.22 sets the priority
for a weaker king to seek a treaty (saüdhi), which, we shall later see,
bears a close relationship to some of the opening texts of the (cid:2)DhP:141
prav(cid:8)ttacakreõ(cid:2)kr(cid:2)nto r(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2) balavat(cid:2)balaþ |
saüdhinopanamet t(cid:6)rõaü ko(cid:3)adaõó(cid:2)tmabh(cid:6)mibhiþ ||
A weak [king] who is attacked by a strong king who has sent forth his
army, should quickly submit through a treaty with [the offer of] his
treasury, army, himself or territory.
Three different types of treaty are enumerated—through the surrender
of the army (daõóopanata), of the treasury (ko(cid:3)opanata) and of terri-
tory (de(cid:3)opanata)—which are then analysed further into subtypes.142
These treaties do not necessarily entail a final defeat, rather, in accor-
dance with the purpose of the ù(cid:2)óguõya mentioned above, the king
must strive to overcome his enemies and assume a more powerful po-
sition when the opportunity presents itself. They often, therefore, con-
tain a deceptive component.143
The requirement that a weakened king seek to recover his position
is evident also in the prakaraõa h(cid:5)na(cid:3)aktip(cid:6)raõam, ‘recoupment of
powers that have become weak’, which discusses the position of the
vijig(cid:5)ùu when attacked by his ‘confederated allies’ (s(cid:2)mav(cid:2)yika).144 If
he is ‘in a hurry because of hurt due to a calamity’ (vyasanopagh(cid:2)ta-
tvarita), then after making a treaty (saüdhi) through the surrender of
his army or treasury, he should counteract his weakness. The KA
analyses this ‘weakness’ into four different kinds, ‘weakness in fol-
lowers’ (pakùe h(cid:5)na), ‘in the power of counsel’ (mantra(cid:3)aktih(cid:5)na), ‘in
might’ (prabh(cid:2)vah(cid:5)na) and ‘in energy’ (uts(cid:2)hah(cid:5)na), and explains
how to redress each. In the first case he should create ‘a party of rela-
tives and allies’ (bandhumitrapakùaü) or an ‘unassailable fort’ (dur-
gam aviùahyaü); in the second, expand his quantity of wise men
(pr(cid:2)j(cid:9)apuruùa), or make contact with learned elders (vidy(cid:2)v(cid:8)ddha); in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
141 Especially SU 2 ((cid:2)DhP 129), see below pp.211ff.
142 KA 7.2.23-36. As Kangle notes, (cid:2)tmopanatasaüdhi is treated under daõóopa-
natasaüdhi.
143 E.g. KA 7.3.26, 30, 32, 33.
144 KA 7.14.
‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 75
the third, the welfare (yogakùema) of his subjects; and in the last, se-
cure the services of ‘heroic men from guilds, bands of thieves, forest
tribes, barbarians and secret agents who can do harm to enemies’
((cid:3)reõ(cid:5)prav(cid:5)rapuruù(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü coragaõ(cid:2)ñavikamlecchaj(cid:2)t(cid:5)n(cid:2)ü par(cid:2)pak(cid:2)ri-
õ(cid:2)ü g(cid:6)óhapuruù(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü ca). Then, ‘furnished with followers, counsel,
material wealth and an army’ (pakùeõa mantreõa dravyeõa ca balena
ca), he should again launch an attack against the enemy who had pre-
viously oppressed him (KA 7.4.12-27).
The following chapter, KA 7.15, develops a different strategy, the
‘taking of refuge’: ‘A weak king attacked by a strong king should seek
shelter with someone whose strength is greater than his own …’145 If
there is no one of greater strength with whom he can seek shelter, then
he should make an alliance with other kings or aristocracies
(saügha);146 and failing this he should find shelter in a fort (durga)
from where he can employ various means of destabilising and over-
coming the attacking king (KA 7.15.1-12). The substance of this chap-
ter shares an obviously close relationship to book 12 ‘on the weaker
king’ ((cid:2)bal(cid:5)yas). Book 12 begins in a similar manner to 7.15 and is
concerned, as it states in the first verse quoted from Bh(cid:3)radv(cid:3)ja, with
‘a weak king attacked by a stronger king’ (bal(cid:5)yas(cid:2)bhiyukto dur-
balaþ). After dismissing the views of both Bh(cid:3)radv(cid:3)ja, who recom-
mends being submissive ‘like a reed’ (vetasadharm(cid:2)),147 and
Vi(cid:5)(cid:3)l(cid:3)kùa, who prefers fighting despite the poor odds (see above page
72), Kauñilya reiterates the advice he gave in 7.15, to find shelter with
a more powerful king or seek out an impregnable fortress,148 for ‘one
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
145 KA 7.15.1 durbalo r(cid:2)j(cid:2) balavat(cid:2)bhiyuktas tadvi(cid:3)iùñabalam (cid:2)(cid:3)rayeta … The
king seeking shelter should act subserviently to the king providing the shelter, see
7.15.21-30.
146 On this notion, see Mabbett, Truth, Myth, pp.114f.; Scharfe, The State, pp.233f.
147 This simile, left unexplained here, and which also occurs at Pa(cid:9)catantra 3.59
(Edgerton ed.), is explained in a story found in RDhP 114 which relates a tale of how
a weak (durbala) king should behave towards a more powerful enemy (amitra ati-
v(cid:8)ddha). Of all kinds of foliage that grows in rivers, only reeds (vetasa) resist being
pulled to the ocean because they bend with the currents. Curiously, the second half of
the quote from Bh(cid:3)radv(cid:3)ja in KA 12.1.2, indrasya hi sa praõamati yo bal(cid:5)yaso na-
mati, occurs in a close parallel in RDhP 67.11 (as noted by Kangle, The Kauñil(cid:5)ya,
vol.2, p.462), etayopamay(cid:2) dh(cid:5)raþ saünameta bal(cid:5)yase | indr(cid:2)ya sa praõamate na-
mate yo bal(cid:5)yase || ‘By this strategy a clever (or: courageous?) king should submit to
a more powerful king, [for] he submits to Indra who submits to a more powerful
king.’ The strategy is the same as that found in the KA (one should bend to the de-
mands of the more powerful), yet the simile is expressed differently: wood (d(cid:2)ru)
which bends itself does not need to be heated, nor bent by another.

who always submits despairs of life’, and one fighting with a small
army (alpasainya) perishes ‘like one plunging in the ocean without a
boat’ (samudram iv(cid:2)plavo ’vag(cid:2)ham(cid:2)naþ s(cid:5)dati).149 He then describes
three different kinds of attacking king, and the measures with which
they are satisfied: the righteous conqueror (dharmavijayin) is satisfied
with submission (abhyavapatti); the greedy conqueror (lobhavijayin)
with wealth (artha); and the demonic conqueror (asuravijayin) only
with ‘land, goods, sons, wives and life’ (bh(cid:6)midravyaputrad(cid:2)ra-
pr(cid:2)õa).150 The RDhP too is aware of this taxonomy, and though it
teaches that the vijig(cid:5)ùu should be dharmic,151 it also considers, as we
will see in the (cid:2)DhP, the problem of the adharmic conqueror. From
this point on Book 12 discusses various means to either survive or
overcome the conqueror, topics introduced by KA 12.1.17-18:
teù(cid:2)m anyatamam uttiùñham(cid:2)naü saüdhin(cid:2) mantrayuddhena k(cid:6)ña-
yuddhena v(cid:2) prativy(cid:6)heta ||
(cid:3)atrupakùam asya s(cid:2)mad(cid:2)n(cid:2)bhy(cid:2)m svapakùaü bhedadaõó(cid:2)bhy(cid:2)m ||
When one of these is rising up, one should array oneself against him by
means of a treaty, by a diplomatic war, or through war by trickery. [He
should win over] the party of his (the conqueror’s) enemy through con-
ciliation and generosity, his (the conqueror’s) own party through dis-
sension and force.
Peace (saüdhi) is not always possible, and the KA therefore contains
sections on mantrayuddha, ‘diplomatic war’ (12.2.1-7152) and k(cid:6)ña-
yuddha, ‘war by trickery’ (at least 12.2.8ff., but probably 12.2-5 as
well153). But peace is the most desirable outcome, and the remainder of
chapter 12.1 suggests a number of ways to bring it about, ranging
from ‘injurious deeds’ (apak(cid:2)ra) to various kinds of treaties more or
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
149 Cf. KA 7.15.14, which expresses something similar using the simile of a moth
that falls into a flame, found also in the Pa(cid:9)catantra verse mentioned above (n.147).
150 KA 12.1.10-16.
151 RDhP 59.38-9 speaks of victory (vijaya) linked to dharma (dharmayukta),
wealth (arthayukta), and demonic ((cid:2)sura) victory. Cf. also RDhP 96 which concerns
victory by righteous means (dharmeõa vijaya) for the kùatriya eager to conquer (vi-
jig(cid:5)ùeta) another kùatriya, an obvious reference to the vijig(cid:5)ùu, as is made clear in 97
which continues this topic. RDhP 104 also distinguishes between the mild (m(cid:8)du) and
the harsh (t(cid:5)kùõa) enemy. Dharmavijaya is reminiscent, of course, of A(cid:5)oka.
152 This book is structurally problematic, causing Kangle to amend the colophons
in his addition, on which see the discussion by Scharfe, Investigations, pp.31f.
153 Kangle thinks the rest of the book, Scharfe (Investigations, p.32 n.50) only

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 77
less similar to those in 7.3.154 As in that earlier chapter, the point is for
the king to recover his position, hence the often somewhat deceptively
wrought treaties. The king should always protect his own self because,
in the end, the kingdom is nothing without the king; dead, he cannot
pursue the recovery of his position. As Malamoud has said, “he must
give up part in order to save (what remains of) the whole, and to give
up what is accessory, if need be, to preserve what is essential—the
essential, in a kingdom, being the king’s own person”,155 thus KA
12.1.32:
yat prasahya hared anyas tat prayacched up(cid:2)yataþ |
rakùet svadehaü na dhanaü k(cid:2) hy anitye dhane day(cid:2) ||
Whatever another might take using force he should give away through
any of the means. He ought to protect his body, not his wealth, for why
pine for wealth when it doesn’t last?156
2.3 Concluding remarks
The preceding discussion demonstrates the different approaches to the
problem of ‘distress’ or ‘calamities’ ((cid:2)pad, vyasana) in the KA and
the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition, approaches that are a consequence of the
particular orientations of each tradition. The KA attempts to ‘objec-
tively’ analyse the various situations that constitute a ‘calamity’ so
that a king may avoid them, arise from them or take advantage of
them at an enemy’s expense. This reflects the general royal obligation
in ancient Indian political thought for the king to establish the condi-
tions in which his kingdom can flourish, conditions which, from the
perspective of br(cid:3)hmaõic ideology, are measured by the extent that
they enable the king’s citizens to pursue the proper behaviour
(dharma) in keeping with their social class, the paradigm being, of
course, br(cid:3)hmans. On the other hand, the approach exemplified in the
dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition, with its roots going back to the earliest
dharmas(cid:6)tras, discusses the problem of (cid:2)pad ‘subjectively’: how can

154 See above p.74.
155 C. Malamoud, “On the Rhetoric and Semantics of Puruù(cid:3)rthas,” CIS, 15
(1981), pp.33f. Malamoud refers to Udyogaparvan 126.48, though the reference is
incorrectly given as 127.48, a verse found also in 37.16 of the same book.
156 This idea is expressed frequently in Indian literature, see L. Sternbach, “Quota-
tions from the Kauñil(cid:8)ya-Artha(cid:5)(cid:3)stra I,” JAOS, 88.3 (1968), p.515. It also has a paral-
lel in (cid:2)DhP 136.171-3. See also below p.215 for other instances.

individuals survive when forces beyond their control make the pursu-
ance of their normative occupations impossible. Paradoxically, while
the primary concern of this approach is to maintain the separation of
the social classes and their respective occupations, it achieves this by
allowing a conditional relaxation of this separation. Expressions of
both these approaches are found in the (cid:2)DhP.
Neither tradition especially reflects on the king’s conduct in ‘times
of distress’ specifically in terms of dharma, nor on any personal con-
sequences for the king in undertaking such conduct, conduct often
entailing what otherwise might be understood as nefarious behaviour.
Indeed, they are more likely to be critical of the king who does not
pursue such conduct, since this would entail an abnegation of his royal
responsibilties. In this regard, Kangle makes a valid point when he
questions the impression that “Many scholars” have of a “difference in
outlook between the R(cid:3)jadharma sections of the Sm(cid:7)ti and the Artha-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra in the matter of duties laid down for the king”.157 As an exam-
ple he cites Ghoshal who describes this difference by referring to the
concept of r(cid:2)jadharma in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras as “rules determined by
the ideal of the highest good of this individual” (i.e. the king), whilst
the KA conceives of the king’s conduct “primarily with reference to
the interests of the State”.158 Kangle proceeds to show that in both
cases the reverse can also be demonstrated, quoting examples from the
KA which tell us that by performing his duty the king attains heaven
(1.3.16, 3.1.41), and points out that the duties of the king in the sec-
tions dealing with r(cid:2)jadharma in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras refer little to his
‘highest good’, and rather more so to his duties concerning the state.
In this light, Derrett’s comments too are curious, when he refers to the
MS’s “allusive attempts to embrace learning from the artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra”,159
and elsewhere:160
One of the most striking features of Book VII [of the MS] is the au-
thor’s simple adherence to artha-(cid:5)(cid:3)stra technique until nearly the end of
his exposition, when, fearing that, if he added no caveant lectores, his
overall scheme would be spoiled, he inserted passages palliating the
picture of unethical opportunism he had already painted and subordinat-
ing his material to fundamental dharmic principles.

‘DISTRESS’ IN THE LITERATURE ON DHARMA AND ARTHA 79
It is unfortunate that Derrett has not more fully explored these views,
since it is unclear in what MS stanzas he detected “caveant lectores”,
or, indeed, what he means by “fundamental dharmic principles”. The
closing passages of the MS 7 do not, to my mind, ‘palliate’ anything,
they simply refer to the king’s daily activities rather than to issues of
state.161 Similarly, Biardeau refers to the “The discreet silence that
Manu makes on the multiple compromises of the king with impurity,
especially with that of war …”162 But, rather than being ‘discreetly
silent’ on the duties of kings and the rules for engagement in war,
which includes taking advantage of an enemy’s weaknesses and ma-
nipulating the conditions of peace (just like the KA), in comparison
with earlier dharma literature the MS is positively verbose on this
subject matter.163 As far as the conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic conception of
dharma expressed in the MS (and, indeed, the KA) is concerned, there
need not be any conflict between the various duties of the king—some
of which might otherwise be considered unsavoury—and “fundamen-
tal dharmic principles”. The MS does not acknowledge a conflict be-
tween the king’s duties and dharma per se, because in its terms there
is no conflict. The “fundamental dharmic principles” of the MS re-
strict the king’s dharma to a specific sphere of operation, just as they
do other conceptions of dharma, such as that of ascetics, householders
and the s(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõa dharmas that apply to everyone.164 This is not to
say, as Biardeau recognises, “that the problem is not posed”,165 but for
an exploration of this problem we have to look elsewhere, to the Mbh,
for example, where a conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic ideology of dharma, as
expressed formatively in the dharmas(cid:6)tras and classically in the MS,
comes into conflict with ‘newer’ conceptions of dharma, which the
MS has already begun to subsume within its sphere of br(cid:3)hmaõic ide-
ology.

80 CHAPTER TWO
The texts that make up the (cid:2)DhP reflect both these traditions of deal-
ing with problems of ‘distress’ or ‘calamity’. In reflecting, however,
the general ‘subjective’ viewpoint of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition, the
texts of the (cid:2)DhP do not contain those (cid:2)paddharma rules that are
typical of this tradition. These are found in the RDhP (see the table in
FIGURE 5 above). In the juxtapositions of its texts, the (cid:2)DhP com-
bines, rather, the political concerns that it shares with the KA with the
subjectivism of the dharma literature, along with refractions from
‘newer’ articulations of dharma (which are explored in the next chap-
ter). In the coalescence of its themes, and the anxieties they reveal, the
(cid:2)DhP embodies a rearticulation of a br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship in
terms of dharma, a rearticulation that reflects the broader problems of
kingship that the Mbh expresses. These problems and the conflict be-
tween different articulations of dharma, particularly as both are ex-
pressed through the figure of the dharma-king Yudhiùñhira, will be
explored in chapter four. The next chapter discusses the significance
of the concept of dharma for our understanding of the compound
(cid:2)paddharma and the particular collection of texts that forms the
(cid:2)DhP.
(cid:3)
CHAPTER THREE
DHARMA
Having discussed the intellectual and textual background to general
conceptual area denoted by (cid:2)pad and related terms in chapter two, this
chapter explores the other half of our key term, dharma, one of the
more complicated concepts in the history of Indian ideas. The notion
of dharma was deeply implicated in the intellectual struggles of the
post-vedic to early classical period in ancient India, a period which
sees the composition of the epics, the decline of the (cid:3)rauta sacrifice,
the rise of the heterodox religions of Buddhism, Jainism and (cid:2)j(cid:8)-
vikism, the beginnings of the various bhakti traditions, and the transi-
tion from ‘Br(cid:3)hmaõism’ to something closer to what we understand
today as ‘Hinduism’. Perhaps most intriguingly, it also sees the begin-
ning and rapid growth of the dharma literature, an enormously sig-
nificant event in the history of br(cid:3)hmaõic scholasticism.
This chapter investigates the history of the word dharma in order to
gauge the meaning and significance of the term through its develop-
ment into one of the most important concepts in the br(cid:3)hmaõic and
Hindu traditions. This analysis provides, firstly, a context in which to
explain Yudhiùñhira’s conflict over dharma, especially as it manifests
in the opening chapters of the (cid:6)P. This conflict, which is explored in
chapter four, forms the narrative frame of the (cid:2)DhP. Secondly, it pro-
vides a context in which to explain two related matters: the signifi-
cance of the term dharma in the compound (cid:2)paddharma, and the sig-
nificance behind the collecting together of a group of texts under the
rubric ‘(cid:4)paddharmaparvan’.
While on the one hand (cid:2)paddharma denotes behaviour that is in
some way exceptional, on the other it also suggests that this behaviour
is in some way legitimate. This sense of legitimacy is especially car-
ried by the word dharma. The compound (cid:2)paddharma first appears in
the MS and the Mbh.1 Its coining was an outcome of the rising signifi-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1 MS 1.116; 10.130 (cf. 9.56); Mbh 1.2.64, 198; 97.21, 26; 104.6; 146.26; 149.11;
2.69.19; 5.28.3; 154.6; 7.27.19; 12.80.8; 151.34, 262.18; 13.134.54.
82 CHAPTER THREE
cance of the word dharma, a significance that led to it becoming one
of the most important concepts in all Indian traditions, and that also
led to a concomitant broadening of its application. The central and
authoritative place dharma assumes within these traditions gave rise
to a tendency for debates over appropriate forms of behaviour to be
undertaken in terms of dharma and, accordingly, it became standard
practice to accommodate a set of ideas to the concept of dharma. This
chapter traces the development of dharma into this central and au-
thoritative position.
Section 3.1 surveys the development of what I shall refer to as the
conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic concept of dharma that crystallised in the
dharmas(cid:6)tras. Section 3.2 explores challenges to this conservative
model mounted by other traditions that we could loosely term ‘as-
cetic’, challenges which would have a profound effect on br(cid:3)hmaõic
conceptions of dharma already by the time of the MS. Section 3.3 dis-
cusses the usage of dharma in the edicts of A(cid:5)oka, because it repre-
sents an important counterpoint to its usage in the br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition,
and because it bears useful comparison to the way dharma is asso-
ciated with Yudhiùñhira, since in both cases we can perceive the shap-
ing influence of the new religious movements. The two usages of
dharma traced here—what we might term the ‘conservative br(cid:3)h-
maõic’ and the ‘ascetic’—became particularly important for the pres-
entation of dharma, and Yudhiùñhira’s relationship to dharma, in the
Mbh, a topic explored in the next chapter.
3.1 The origins of dharma: from dharman to dharma
It is a curious but important fact that a certain self-consciousness in
respect to dharma emerges quite late in the (br(cid:3)hmaõic) Indian tradi-
tion. Prior to the period of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, for example, there was
little effort to describe what exactly dharma designates, though the
word has a long history dating back to the »gveda, where it occurs in
a slightly different form and with a somewhat different meaning. It
has, indeed, become a cliché to evoke the near absence of discussions
of dharma in the literature preceding the dharmas(cid:6)tras.2 Sheldon Pol-

DHARMA 83
lock has recently questioned the merit of this, suggesting that dharma
originally belonged to the world of ritual, and hence that “the «world(cid:11)
outside of ritualism had originally little to do with dharma”.3 An
analysis of the word in vedic contexts suggests that there are problems
and merits with both of these views. While dharma certainly was used
in ritual contexts and, perhaps, even has its origins in early cos-
mogonic ritual myths, it was also relatively common for it to be used
outside of the confines of ritual, in contexts that might be termed ‘so-
ciological’, usages that are important indicators of the future direc-
tions that the concept of dharma would take. Yet it is true that, despite
its significant occurrences in both ‘sociological’ and ‘ritual’ contexts,
the word dharma was clearly not very central in the vedic period and
had only marginal conceptual importance. Vedic literature does not
typically explain its concerns in terms of dharma, nor does the word
dharma encode legitimacy in vedic literature with quite the same force
as it will in later times. While the dharmas(cid:6)tras represent a crystalli-
sation of all the usages of dharma in the vedic literature that preceded
it, they also represent a shift in world view that takes dharma from the
margins to the centre of br(cid:3)hmaõic thought, and with this shift there is
a corresponding expansion of its purview.4

84 CHAPTER THREE
3.1.1 Saühit(cid:3)s
Until recently5 the most substantial study tracing the semantic devel-
opment of dharma through the vedic period was by Paul Horsch.6 In
establishing its ‘mythic origin’ Horsch draws out the etymology of the
word from its verbal root (cid:2)dh(cid:8), ‘to hold, support’ from which the noun
of action dhárman and the noun of agency dharmán are derived,7 the
forms found in the »gveda. In vedic cosmogony, the verb plays a
similar role to other synonymous verbs, principally referring to the
supporting ((cid:2)dh(cid:8)) of the sky, the holding apart (vi-(cid:2)dh(cid:8)) of the earth
and sky, and the strengthening of the unstable, just-created cosmos.8
Much of this activity was attributed to Indra and Varuõa, though the
other gods sometimes played a role as well. Noting the great difficulty
the word has caused modern interpreters of the »gveda,9 Horsch main-
tains that the »gveda by and large retains the sense of the root in the
noun, especially in the cosmological myths, where it expresses the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
5 At the time when this chapter was written as part of the doctoral thesis upon
which this volume is based, there were few substantial secondary sources dealing with
the history of the word dharma (notwithstanding the comment of A. Kunst in “Use
and Misuse of Dharma,” in The Concept of Duty in South Asia, eds W.D. O’Flaherty
and J.D.M. Derrett, p.3, “hardly any topic has been more lavishly treated in books and
articles than that of dharma”). Since then a special edition of JIP (vol.32 nos 5-6,
2004) has appeared in which a number of prominent scholars have tackled various
aspects of its history. It is gratifying to see that some of the ideas presented here are
also dealt with in a number of these articles, which, however, also go far beyond the
scope of this section. References to some of these articles have been incorporated
where appropriate.

from comparison with Jarrod Whitaker’s recent translation published as “From Crea-
tion Myth to World Law: The Earl History of Dharma,” JIP, 32 (2004), pp.423-48.) In
n.1 Horsch announces his attention to return more fully to the subject in a book on
“Das vedische Weltgesetz”, which seems not to have appeared. Cf. H. de Willman-
Grabowska, “Evolution semantique du mot ‘dharma’,” Rocznik Orientalistyczny, 10

as the second stage of vedic cosmogony. Brereton (“Dhárman”) has adduced its pri-
mary signification as “foundation”.

meaning ‘support’ (Halt), or ‘prop’ (St(cid:10)tz).10 As an example he cites
RV 6.70.1cd:
dyμv(cid:2)p(cid:8)thivã váruõasya dhármaõ(cid:2)
víùkabhite ajáre bh½riretas(cid:2) ||
Sky and earth, ageless and abundant in sperm, were held apart with the
support of Varuõa.
In this case dhárman is the means by which this cosmic act is per-
formed. It “expresses the function of the verb”, and should be under-
stood metaphorically “in a dynamic-functional sense” rather than “as a
concretely serviceable support”.11 Once heaven and earth have been
separated in the act of creation, dhárman sometimes is the means by
which things may function within that opened up space, so in 1.160.1d
the sun moves between the sky and earth (‘the two bowls’) by virtue
of this support, stopping it from falling down,12 and in 10.65.5c Mi-
tra’s and Varuõa’s great creation (the sun) shines by dhárman.13 Or in
2.13.7ab it is the means by which things are kept apart (vi-(cid:2)dh(cid:8))
within this space, as when Indra distributes (vi-(cid:2)dh(cid:8)) over the land
(adhi dμne) plants that bear flowers (puùpíõ(cid:5)) and seeds (or fruits?

the space between earth and sky itself, and “wide expanse” in gen-
eral.14

former where she translates dhármaõ(cid:2) as ‘according to the laws of nature’, suggesting
that the sun itself has a ‘law’ which it obeys (cf. also Renou, “Sur deux mots,” p.160).
This understanding of dharma as a ‘natural law’ operating in the objective world is
objected to by Halbfass in India and Europe, p.315.

86 CHAPTER THREE
The ritual dharma is the reactualization and earthly analogue of the
original cosmogonic acts of ‘upholding’ and ‘holding apart’. Whatever
the functions of the ritual in Indian history may have been—its funda-
mental, though forgotten connection with cosmogony, and its commit-
ment to ‘upholding’ the space of the world, and to keeping the entities
in it apart from each other and in their appropriate identities, is beyond
question.
This relationship is evident in RV 1.164.50ab and 10.90.16, where the
sacrificial cosmogonic act performed by the gods is described as
dhárm(cid:2)õi prathamμni. Horsch translates this as “the first supports
(St(cid:10)tzen)”, and Halbfass as “the first ritual statutes or laws”,16 a differ-
ence suggesting the relationship between dharma, ritual and cosmog-
ony. If the ritual acts emulate the cosmogony, then these ritual acts are
the laws which establish and then support the world, maintaining its
order and divisions through the repetition of the cosmogonic act.
Elsewhere, the kindling of the sacrificial fire occurs in accordance
with the first laws (samidhyám(cid:2)naþ prathamμnu dhárm(cid:2)) which sup-
ported the universe in its first division.17 RV 10.90 is particularly in-
structive here because the cosmogonic sacrifice in this case involves
the initial creation and separation of the four social classes (varõas),
the description of the duties of which became synonymous with the
conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic notion of dharma, a relationship which would
become explicit in the mythic frame of the Manusm(cid:7)ti.
With the world’s ‘support’ and the order of the cosmos depending
upon the proper performance of the ritual on the human plane, dharma
first emerges into the domain of human behaviour. This movement
may explain how dhárman came to be transplanted into the broader
realm of social behaviour, a process which begins with the »gveda
and gathers pace from then on. To quote Horsch:18
… the originally concrete, mythic concept is generalised and from there
became an abstract expression. The props of the worlds and the ritualis-
tic ceremonies guarantee the ‘support’ and stability, the regularity and
duration of the cosmos: dhárman essentially becomes the foundation of

further examples of gods performing their cosmogonic and cosmological acts by vir-
tue of having a ‘support’ (dhárman).

DHARMA 87
order and lawfulness, thus a ‘law’ in general to which man has to com-
ply.
A case in point is the funerary hymn addressed to Varuõa in RV
7.89.5, ‘if we have unknowingly violated your laws, O god, do not
hurt us for that offence’.19 Other remarkable instances are also found
in RV 6.70.3c, 8.27.16c and 10.63.13b, which state that a man ‘repro-
duces himself through his offspring in accordance with the law’ (prá
prajμbhir j(cid:2)yate dhármaõas pári …), pointing already to its later ap-
plication in the dharma literature. As Horsch suggests, the production
of offspring has become man’s duty, through which he fulfils his so-
cial and ritual obligations, and perhaps, in accordance with its strict
etymology, a man establishes for himself a ‘support’ in this life.20
In the AV dhárman is still found as the instrument of a god, in par-
ticular in its connection with Varuõa. In AV 6.132, a love charm, love
(smará) and intense burning ((cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:3)uc(cid:2)na) are kindled in the man ‘by the
law of Varuõa’ (váruõasya dhármaõ(cid:2)). Here dhárman seems to have
not so much a cosmological consequence, but rather is a ‘divine law’
which can be invoked on the human plane in the pursuance of a de-
sired object. With the AV the transposition to the social plane has be-
come more pronounced than before. AV 12.1.45ab refers to ‘the earth
who bears people of varied speech and custom according to their place
of habitation’,21 and in a nuptial hymn, ‘by law you are my wife, I am

nian and Indo-European Studies Presented to Fransiscus Bernadus Jacobus Kuiper
on his Sixtieth Birthday, The Hague, Paris: Mouton, 1968, p.474), Horsch has pointed
to the similarity of this to p(cid:8)thagdharmavid in GDhS 28.49. While Gautama is refer-
ring to three different law ‘treatises’, as Horsch understands, significantly they both
suggest that dharma was subject to variation. Horsch follows a commentator, who
glosses the GDhS passage as saying that dharma varies according to school, status,
region and so on. The sense of the AV passage is also reflected in other dharmas(cid:6)tra
passages which refer to the dharmas of region (de(cid:3)a), caste (j(cid:2)ti) or family (kula), as
for example GDhS 11.20, (cid:2)pDhS 2.15.1, BDhS 1.2.6, VDhS 1.17 and 19.7. The no-
tion of kuladharma, customs that vary according to family, is also frequently found in
the g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras, e.g. (cid:2)pGS 6.16.7, 7.20.19, HGS 2.9.12, Bh(cid:3)GS 2.10.18, (cid:2)(cid:5)vGS
1.17.1; 1.17.18; in similar sense too are the compounds janapadadharma and gr(cid:2)ma-
dharma, ‘the customs of regions and villages’ in (cid:2)(cid:5)vGS 1.7.1. On these see below

your husband’.22 At the same time as the concept becomes progres-
sively more associated with the social sphere, a significant morpho-
logical change occurs whereby dhárman becomes dharma,23 as in the
funeral verse in which a wife is said to lie beside her dead husband
‘following an ancient law (or custom)’ (dhármaü pur(cid:2)õáü an-
up(cid:2)láyant(cid:5)).24 Whilst not discounting the possibility of a linguistic ex-
planation for this morphological change, Horsch suggests a semantic
reason: while the suffix -man emphasises the activity of the meaning
of the root, the abstract -a ending accords with the generalised abstract
sense of the word as ‘law’.25 It seems likely, however, that the two
forms existed side by side for some time. Hence, for example, in TS
1.7.7.1 and V(cid:3)jS 9.5d and 18.30 we find the form dharman employed
in tásy(cid:2)ü no deváþ savit(cid:2) dhárma s(cid:2)viùat, cited in the same form in
the latter’s br(cid:2)hmaõa (cid:6)B 5.1.4.4,26 while for the same formula K(cid:3)ñhS
13.14 and MaitrS 1.11.1 employ the form dhárma.27 Elsewhere the
two forms even exist side by side in the same formula, as in V(cid:3)jS 15.6
and (cid:6)B 8.5.3.3 prétin(cid:2) dhármaõ(cid:2) dhármaü jinva.28

ceding see Horsch, “Vom Schöpfungsmythos,” pp.44f.
23 Horsch (p.45) describes this as the “key innovation of the Atharvaveda …”
There are occurrences also in other saühit(cid:2)s, e.g.: SV(K) 1.537 (cf. RV 9.97.22
dhármani); V(cid:3)jS 15.6; 20.9e; 30.6; MaitrS 1.5.4; 1.5.11, 1.11.1; K(cid:3)ñhS 13.14; 15.6;

form.

tory of the Dharma: The Middle and Late Vedic Periods,” JIP, 32 (2004), pp.507-8

26 See also below p.91.
27 Perhaps this reflects dialectical/regional variation. MaitrS and K(cid:3)ñhS are west-
erly, while TS, V(cid:3)jS and (cid:6)B are more easterly; cf. M. Witzel, “Tracing the Vedic
dialects,” in C. Caillat (ed.), Dialectes dans les littératures indo-aryennes, Paris,
1989, pp.97-264.
28 Cf. MaitrS 2.8.8 préty(cid:2) dhármaõe dhárma jinva in which some manuscripts
give dhármaü for dhárma, see ed. L. von Schroeder, vol.2 p.112; also MaitrS 1.5.4
and 1.5.11 dhármo m(cid:2) dhármaõaþ p(cid:2)tu. The same formula can be employed in dif-
ferent forms even in the same text, e.g. K(cid:3)ñhS 17.7 dharmaõe tv(cid:2) dharma jinva;
K(cid:3)ñhS 37.17 dharmeõa tv(cid:2) dharmaü jinva. According to von Schroeder (ed. vol.1

DHARMA 89
3.1.2 Br(cid:3)hmaõas
When analysing the br(cid:2)hmaõas for references to dharma(n) we have
to distinguish between occurrences found in citations from the mostly
earlier saühit(cid:2) literature, and those which are not found in these
saühit(cid:2)s. The latter provide a more accurate reflection of whatever
semantic development may have occurred between the two classes of
literature, though sometimes the citations are reinterpreted in their
new contexts and thereby provide illuminating data as well. The ma-
jority of the references to dharma in the br(cid:2)hmaõas are, in fact, cita-
tions from the saühit(cid:2)s, and often in these instances it seems the
original meaning of ‘support’ or ‘foundation’ has been retained.29 The
non-citation occurrences of the word are less frequent, and in these the
form dharma predominates.30 Sometimes the formulas from a saühit(cid:2)
found in a br(cid:2)hmaõa are given the newer form dharma, as in TB
1.2.1.10a samidhyám(cid:2)naþ pratham(cid:10) nú dhármaþ which is also found
in RV 3.17.1a with the form dhárman, indicating both the extent to
which this new form has taken over and the once fluid nature of RV
mantras.31 Sometimes the two forms exist side by side, as in (cid:6)B
14.2.2.29, which concerns the Pravargya rite in which a pot containing
milk is heated until it is red hot, thereby representing the sun. In this
passage, dharman occurs in the mantra quoted from V(cid:3)jS 38.14,
while dharma is given in the br(cid:2)hmaõa’s interpretation. The sense
here is still ‘support’: the Mah(cid:3)v(cid:8)ra pot (the sun) is addressed with the
mantra ‘you are a well supporting support’ (dhárm(cid:2)si sudhárma)
since he is a support (dhárma) who shines, ‘for everything here he

29 E.g. in (cid:6)B 3.6.1.16 and JB 1.72 the pillar of the Sadas hut is erected with a for-
mula evoking the ‘firm support of Mitra and Varuõa’ in JB or ‘Mitra and Varuõa with
firm support’ in (cid:6)B (cf. TS 1.3.1.2; V(cid:3)jS 5.27; MaitrS 1.2.11; 3.8.9). The cosmogonic
symbolism, the earthly ritual analogue of the cosmogonic act, is quite clear. Cf. H.
Bodewitz, The Jyotiùñoma Ritual. Jaimin(cid:5)ya Br(cid:2)hmaõa I, 66-364. Introduction, trans-

TB 2.5.7.2; 3.11.1.20; 3.9.16.2.
31 For the RV mantra see n.17 above. As is well known the TB, like the TS, in-
termingles mantra and br(cid:2)hmaõa material (see J. Gonda, Vedic Literature (Saühit(cid:2)s
and Br(cid:2)hmaõas), Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1975, pp.324f., 350); this is an in-
stance of mantra. M. Witzel discusses the liberal treatment of RV mantras in non RV
traditions, especially in the saühit(cid:2)s, in “The Development of the Vedic Canon and
its schools: The Social and Political Milieu,” in M. Witzel (ed.), Inside the Texts, Be-
yond the Texts: New Approaches to the Study of the Veda, Cambrdge, Mass.: Harvard
Oriental Series, Opera Minora, 1997, pp.268ff.

supports, and by him everything here is supported’ (eùa h¸daü sárvaü
dh(cid:2)ráyaty eténedaü sárvaü dh(cid:8)tám). According to Horsch the desig-
nation of the sun as the ‘support’ here should be understood in a gen-
eral way, no longer in a strictly cosmological sense,32 probably be-
cause of its connection with the fecundity of the earth, or, more spe-
cifically, if van Buitenen is correct, with the crops following the mon-
soon.33
In the non-citation occurrences of dharma the tendency towards a
more sociological foundation to its meaning continues. In particular it
is implicated in the role of the king to maintain order and exercise ju-
risprudence.34 Often too it still retains a cosmological sense, even if
this sometimes has the character of a metaphor, or, rather, is due to the
magical connections typical of br(cid:2)hmaõa speculation. An illuminating
occurrence of dharma is found in (cid:6)B 11.1.6.24 which equates ‘the
waters’ with dharma.35 Horsch suggests that this returns to the notion
that the earth is founded on primordial waters, and hence sees in it the
mythic idea of ‘support’. But it is clear, as he understands also, that in
this context dharma has the sense of ‘law’ or ‘justice’: ‘Therefore
when the waters come to this world, everything here certainly occurs
according to the law; but when there is drought, the stronger then in-
deed seize the weaker, for the waters are the law.’36 The waters (i.e.
the rains) are equated with the ‘law’ because the rains determine the

32 Horsch, “Vom Schöpfungsmythos,” p.49. But cf. J.A.B. van Buitenen, The
Pravargya: an ancient Indian iconic ritual explained and annotated, Poona: Deccan
College, 1968, p.35 (cf. p.67): “This large god [i.e. the sun = the Mah(cid:3)v(cid:8)ra pot] is
eminently the creator as he expands himself in creation: here this penetration takes on
the form of an axis mundi, a pillar between heaven and earth.”

section in T(cid:2) parallel to the (cid:6)B 14.2.2.29 is found at 5.8.6. Also van Buitenen, The
Pravargya, pp.29ff.
34 A jurisprudential sense seems suggested in V(cid:3)jS 30.6 (and TB 3.4.2), concern-
ing the puruùamedha, in which ‘a member of the judicial administration’ (dhárm(cid:2)ya
sabh(cid:2)carám) is sacrificed to dharma, ‘the law’. See also W. Rau, Staat und Gesell-
schaft in alten Indien, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1957, p.81. These are, however,
apparently late texts (Gonda, Vedic Literature, p.330). Cf. now Olivelle, “The Seman-

prosperity of the earth, and this prosperity determines the degree to
which people are capable of following the ‘law’.37 This anticipates
later ideas too. Indeed, perhaps it expresses the very problem
(cid:2)paddharma is designed to address: in a time of distress, which may
indeed be a lack of rain,38 law and social order become difficult to
maintain. The order of causality in the (cid:6)B passage indicates that good
rains provide the foundation for the law. Later this relationship was
often reversed, and the non-performance of dharma was said to bring
about drought. Thus in VDhS 3.12 those kingdoms experience
drought in which the ignorant eat the food of the learned;39 and in
RDhP 91.34-8 drought and the general disorder of the seasons occurs
when the king neglects dharma,40 i.e. such neglect is a sign of a bad
king. This indicates a later shift in meaning: not only does dharma
‘support’, but it must also be ‘supported’.
The increasing association of dharma with kingship or political
power seems to be implied in the (cid:6)B’s presentation of the V(cid:3)japeya,
though this is not strictly a royal rite.41 (cid:6)B 5.1.4.4 cites V(cid:3)jS 9.5g (tás-
y(cid:2)ü no deváþ savitμ dhárma s(cid:2)viùat), which is understood to mean

man, “The symbolic significance of the number twelve in ancient India,” Journal of

Bh(cid:6)-bhojana: An Indian Conundrum,” BSOAS, 22 (1959), pp.117ff.
There was, however, always some ambivalence over whether the proper pursuance
of dharma created the state of the times, or the state of the times restricted the ability
of people to follow dharma. Thus the former is reflected in the idea that the king is
the ‘maker of the age’ (e.g. Mbh 5.130.15ff.; RDhP 70; 92.6; (cid:2)DhP 139.10; MS
9.301-2; cf. Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.3, pp.3 and 892), and the latter in the idea of kalivarjya,
according to which the ability of people to follow dharma deteriorates with each suc-
ceeding age. On this “causal ambivalence”, as Halbfass describes it (India and
Europe, p.318), see below p.112. Cf. Lingat, The Classical Law, pp.189ff., also below

‘thereon may the divine Savit(cid:7) impel our patron of the sacrifice’ (tás-
y(cid:2)ü no deváþ savit(cid:2) yájam(cid:2)naü savat(cid:2)m). Since the text does not
elaborate, it is unclear from the context of the (cid:6)B if anything other
than the meaning of ‘support’ is intended, though it is perhaps not
conveying any of the cosmological sense, rather just ‘support’ in gen-
eral. Gonda suggests that it “creates the impression of a metaphor,
because the author no doubt perceived some features that a support
and his patron have in common”.42 The patron of the V(cid:3)japeya is
someone who desires power or pre-eminence.43 The equation Yaja-
m(cid:2)na = dhárman suggests in part that such a person (who must often
have been a king) has a special relationship with dharma; assuming a
position of political power has with it certain responsibilities in re-
spect to the social order, just as the king is also a patron of the major
sacrifices which seek to guarantee the prosperity of a kingdom and its
people, and therefore he is in some sense the ‘support’ of the people.
There are, however, clearer associations between the king and
dharma. In the AB’s discussion of the R(cid:3)jas(cid:4)ya (royal consecration),
parallel passages first describe the mah(cid:2)bhiùeka (‘great anointing’) of
Indra (8.12) and then the mah(cid:2)bhiùeka of a king (8.17), clearly indi-
cating in the process that Indra is the divine counterpart of the king.44
Once Indra and the king are seated on the throne, the Vi(cid:5)vedevas in
the case of Indra, and the ‘king-makers’ (r(cid:2)jakart(cid:8)) in the case of the
king, proclaim (among other things) that ‘the guardian of dharma has
been born’.45 Clearly this is an early depiction of the role of the king
as the individual who has particular responsiblity for the preservation
of dharma, an idea so prominent in the epics. (cid:6)B 5.3.3.9, which also
concerns the R(cid:3)jas(cid:4)ya, has a similar association, evoking the special
relationship that Varuõa has with dharma as dharmapati: an oblation
made of barley (yavamáya), called a v(cid:2)ruõá, is offered to Varuõa, the
lord of the dhárma, thereby he makes the king the lord (páti) of
dhárma, and so people come to him in matters of law (dhárma

upayánti).46 In this case the jurisprudential implications appear obvi-
ous. Similarly, in a ceremony in the TB’s account of the A(cid:5)vamedha
which makes the Y(cid:3)jamana the overlord (ádhipati), the Adhvaryu ad-
dresses the horse with ‘homage to the overlord’, and then says the
‘overlord is dhárma’ and ‘gains dhárma’ by these words.47 In this re-
gard the difficult passage in JB 3.231 should also be mentioned, in
which the kingdom is equated with dharma, and through this the king
is said to be dharma as well.48 All of this reminds us that the king was
considered to be the very centre of the br(cid:3)hmaõic world, the “cosmic
pillar” as Heesterman has suggested in his study of the R(cid:3)jas(cid:4)ya,49 and
hence the connection with the earlier senses of dharma are still clearly
visible.
While these are striking references for the special association of the
king with dharma, and the developing notion of dharma as ‘law’, and
hence as pertaining to the conduct of people, they tell us little about
the actual content of dharma. But in this direction there is a striking
passage found in (cid:6)B 11.5.7.1. Someone who studies and teaches the
Veda (sv(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)yapravacané) becomes concentrated in mind, indepen-
dent, acquires wealth everyday, sleeps peacefully, becomes his own
best medical practitioner, restrained in his senses, focused on only one
object, acquires fame (yá(cid:3)as), his intelligence increases (praj(cid:9)μ-
v(cid:8)ddhi) and he enables the ripening (‘cooking’) of the world (loka-
paktí). In turn his growing intelligence (práj(cid:9)(cid:2) várdham(cid:2)n(cid:2)) brings
(abhiníùp(cid:2)dayati) to the br(cid:3)hman four dhármas: the status of a br(cid:3)h-
man (brμhmaõya), the proper mode of conduct (pratir(cid:6)pacary(cid:2)), fame
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
46 Cf. (cid:6)B 5.3.3.11, in which V(cid:3)jS 9.39 is muttered ((cid:2)jap) evoking Varuõa to pro-
duce in the king the powers of the dhármapati.

(yá(cid:3)as) and the ‘cooking’ of the world (lokapaktí).50 The world (or, the
people of the world) which is being ‘cooked’ (pácyam(cid:2)na) serves the
br(cid:3)hman in return with four dhármas: worship (arc(cid:2)), generosity
(dμna), and the inviolability of his property (ajyeyát(cid:2)) and life
(avadhyát(cid:2)). Significant developments are evident in this passage.
Horsch observes that the abstract notion of law is broken up into nu-
merous specific ‘concrete factors’, a semantic development he sug-
gests is fundamental for the use of the word in Buddhism.51 Yet it is
also significant for the development of the sense of the term in the
br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition. Law is becoming duty, and there is a clear diver-
gence between the activities and characteristics of one social group,
the br(cid:3)hmans, and the activities of other people, ‘those who are being
cooked’; the relationship between them is reciprocal and complemen-
tary—the sacerdotal and pedagogic role of one entitles him to certain
privileges conferred on him by the others. Such a description would
not at all be out of place in the dharma literature.
3.1.3 Upaniùads
As with the br(cid:2)hmaõas, dharma does not have a central role in the
older upaniùads either. In reference to these texts, Horsch asserts: “In
the foreground … everywhere operates the idea of the constancy and
the universality of the law, which at the same time has validity for the
entirety of natural occurrences and for the individual.”52 In support of
this he cites two examples, B(cid:2)U 2.5.1153 and MNU 22.1. Halbfass
would seem to have Horsch in mind when he suggests, “Citations in-
tended to support a universal cosmological interpretation of dharma
are often taken out of context,” referring in particular to the latter of
the above examples.54 In fact, as Halbfass points out, both of Horsch’s
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
50 This passage is the starting point for an important essay by C. Malamoud,
“Cooking the World,” in Cooking the World, Delhi: OUP, 1996, pp.23-53.

Translation, Oxford: OUP, 1998.
54 Halbfass, India and Europe, p.316. Halbfass cites T(cid:2) 10.79, the MNU is of
course the tenth book of the T(cid:2). The relevant passages are on pp.130ff. of J. Varenne,
La Mah(cid:2) N(cid:2)r(cid:2)yaõa Upaniùad, Paris, 1986. Against understanding dharma in the
sense of “universal cosmic laws”, cf. also Halbfass’ comments (pp.314ff.) on (cid:8)ta and
dharma. Many authors, including Horsch, argue that the latter concept takes over
(cid:3)
DHARMA 95
examples occur in contexts of “stereotyped recurrent phrase[s]”: in
B(cid:2)U 2.5.11 dharma occurs as subject in the eleventh of fourteen
identical passages in which only the subject alters; and in the MNU
example it is the sixth of twelve. One could only agree with Halbfass,
therefore, that neither of these instances provides decisive evidence
for Horsch’s assertion.55 Indeed, the MNU passage describes dharma
as the pratiùñh(cid:2), the ‘support’, of the entire world (vi(cid:3)vasya jagataþ)
which, as Halbfass notes, S(cid:3)yaõa takes to mean rather mundane activi-
ties, such as the provision of wells and water reservoirs.
Rather, reflecting some of the developments already found in the
br(cid:2)hmaõa passages discussed above, what we tend to find in the few
examples of dharma in the older upaniùads are applications of the
word suggesting an incipient phase in the development of the conser-
vative notion of br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma as it would come to be presented
in the oldest dharmas(cid:6)tras. B(cid:2)U 1.4.14 clearly refers to the social
application of the term, hinting again at jurisprudential ideas. Brah-
man created the royal power (kùatra), the vi(cid:3) (the common people)
and the (cid:3)audra varõa in order to become more fully developed (vyab-
havat), but, not becoming so, it created dharma, ‘the ruling power of
the ruling power’ (kùatrasya kùatra). Echoing (cid:6)B 11.1.6.24 (cited
above), through dharma a weaker man can appeal to a stronger man,
just as through a king. Dharma is also equated with truth (satya),
therefore it is said that when one speaks the truth one speaks dharma,
and vice versa. As Horsch notes,56 the significance of this passage lies
in its recognition of the authority of the law. Dharma stands above the
power of the king, and people can appeal to it for justice, just as one
might appeal to the king. It is now independent of any other factor, yet
clearly associated with the creation and separation of the four varõas.
CU 2.23.1 is connected to the kinds of duties later found in the
dharma literature:

from the former. See also M. Biardeau, “Études de mythologie hindoue: Cosmogonies
puraniques II,” Bulletin de l’Ecole Française d’Extrême-Orient, LV (1969), p.99.
55 One might add the problem of drawing conclusions for the upaniùads in general
from the MNU, a late upaniùadic text.

There are three types of persons whose torso is the law. The first is de-
voted to sacrifice, vedic study and gift giving. The second to austerity
alone. The third is a celibate student of the Veda living at his teacher’s
home—that is to say, who is settling himself down permanently in his
teacher’s house. All these gain worlds earned by merit. A person who is
steadfast in brahman attains immortality.
In an important study, Olivelle challenges the tendency of both mod-
ern and traditional scholars to find in this passage the basis of the
(cid:2)(cid:3)rama system,57 though he still sees in it the “same type of theologi-
cal thinking and classification that finally gave birth” to that system,58
which is in fact a much later phenomenon. For us there are two sig-
nificant aspects to this passage. First, different ways of leading a life
(for the whole of that life, as Olivelle points out) are designated as
dharma, a designation that is unusual for vedic literature. Second,
these dharmas are contrasted with another soteriological option: those
who are ‘steadfast in brahman’ attain immortality. Olivelle demon-
strates that brahman in this passage refers to the syllable Oý.59 The
activities referred to as dharmas in this passage are discussed else-
where without that designation (e.g. B(cid:2)U 4.4.22; 6.2.16); sig-
nificantly, then, it demonstrates that the word dharma now denotes
these traditional ‘duties’. But the semantic range is still restricted, in
as much as, if Olivelle’s argument for this passage is accepted, the
activities called dharmas are distinguished from the last option (i.e.,
brahman), a distinction very much reflected in the early dharma lit-
erature as well, as we shall see below. It is revealing for the history of
the word dharma that while in CU 2.23.1 those who are brahma-
saüstha are contrasted with those whose activities are designated as
dharmas,60 later the former shall also be designated as dharma, as for
example in Mbh 12.262.27ff.61 This is a further example of the man-

ner in which the scope of the use of the word dharma expanded as the
word itself assumed greater validating significance. While in the CU it
is no issue to contrast dharma, considered as particular kinds of tradi-
tional religious pursuits, with another soteriological pursuit which is
not designated as a dharma, by the time of the Mbh, very similar ar-
guments about different theological and soteriological options are con-
trasted as different dharmas.62
TU 1.11 contains a similar occurrence of dharma. In 1.11.1, after
the completion of his vedic study, a student is told to ‘speak the truth,
practice dharma, do not neglect your private recitation of the Veda’
(satyaü vada| dharmaü cara| sv(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)y(cid:2)n m(cid:2) pramada), which is
repeated again slightly differently, ‘do not be neglectful of dharma’
(dharm(cid:2)n na pramaditavyam).63 The context clearly indicates that
dharma here must mean something very much like the duties pertain-
ing to the student’s varõa and his responsibilities as a householder.64
1.11.4 also has an interesting formulation in which the student is told
that if he has a doubt (vicikits(cid:2)) concerning a rite (karman) or a prac-
tice (v(cid:8)tta),65 or if his practices are subject to criticism (abhy(cid:2)khy(cid:2)ta),
he should consult br(cid:3)hmans ‘devoted to the law’ (dharmak(cid:2)ma) who
can make a judgement (saümarùina) in the matter. Furthermore, as
they act ((cid:2)v(cid:8)t) he should act ((cid:2)v(cid:8)t). These kinds of statements would
seem to anticipate formulations in the dharma literature which give a
central position to the learned ((cid:3)iùña) and to those of good conduct in
matters pertaining to dharma.66
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
62 Cf. also Olivelle, on BDhS 2.11.9-11 and CU 2.23.1, in his “Renouncer and re-
nunciation,” p.89.
63 R. Smith suggests these latter gerundive formulations are ‘post Buddhist’ com-
mentaries on the former imperative constructions. See his “On the Original Meaning
of Taittir(cid:8)ya Upaniùad 1.11.1-4,” in D. Sinor (ed.), American Oriental Society Middle
West Branch Semi-Centennial Volume, Bloomington, Indian University Press, 1969,
pp.211-16.
64 He is also implored not to cut off the family line (praj(cid:2)tantuü m(cid:2) vyavac-
chets(cid:5)þ). Procreation is of course one of the central duties of the householder.
65 Karma and v(cid:8)tta here should probably be understood as subsets of dharma, the
former indicating rites, the latter all the duties and practices pertaining to the student’s
varõa-directed life style.
66 Cf. TU 1.11.2-3 …y(cid:2)ny asm(cid:2)kaÁ sucarit(cid:2)ni|t(cid:2)ni tvayop(cid:2)sy(cid:2)ni||no ita-
r(cid:2)õi|… ‘you should revere those good practices of mine, not other kinds of prac-
tices’. In the dharmas(cid:6)tras cf. e.g. (cid:2)DhS 1.20.8; 2.29.13-14. By the time of BDhS
(1.1.4ff.) and VDhS (1.6) the conduct of the learned ((cid:3)iùña) is referred to as a ‘source
of dharma’ (dharmam(cid:6)la).
Witzel, “The Development,” p.331, describes this TU section as a “dharmas(cid:4)tra in
nuce”, a description that would not be out of place if applied to some of the other
(cid:3)
98 CHAPTER THREE
A number of other more obscure instances of dharma in the older
upaniùads represent greater difficulties for ascertaining their contribu-
tion to an understanding of its meaning and importance. Horsch iden-
tifies a lingering element of the old cosmological idea of dharma as
‘support’ in the rather enigmatic B(cid:2)U 1.5.23. Beginning in 1.5.21
with the delcaration that it is ‘an analysis of the observances’ (ath(cid:2)to
vratam(cid:5)m(cid:2)üs(cid:2)), this passage establishes a homology between the
body and the divine world.67 First it gives an explanation for why all
the vital functions—speech, sight, hearing and so on—are called
pr(cid:2)õas, ‘breaths’: only the central breath (madhyamaþ pr(cid:2)õaþ) resists
death, which has the guise of weariness. Because of this superiority
the other vital functions become forms of this central breath and are
called pr(cid:2)õa too. The text then moves to the divine sphere
(adhidaivata). Among the deities, Wind (V(cid:3)yu) is identified as the
‘central breath’ (madhyamá pr(cid:2)õá), because it does not disappear like
the other deities (1.5.22). Then follows the verse: ‘from which the sun
rises, and into which it sets’ (yata(cid:3) codeti s(cid:6)ryo ’staü yatra ca gac-
chati) ‘the gods made it dharma’ (taü dev(cid:2)(cid:3) cakrire dharmaü). The
pronouns in this instance refer to pr(cid:2)õa, a fact made clear in a com-
mentary interceding these two passages,68 and the context further indi-
cates that pr(cid:2)õa must mean the ‘central breath’ (madhyama pr(cid:2)õa)
already cited. Horsch says the pr(cid:2)õa “is praised as the supporting,
strengthening power”, and adds that in B(cid:2)U 2.2.1 pr(cid:2)õa is called
sth(cid:6)õ(cid:2), “the sacrificial or supporting post of the world”.69 However,
the latter passage does not directly support the former, since the pr(cid:2)õa
identified there with the sth(cid:6)õ(cid:2) is not the same as the madhyama
pr(cid:2)õa with which 1.5.23 is concerned. In fact, in 2.2.1 this madhyama
pr(cid:2)õa is itself supported by the pr(cid:2)õa the text identifies with sth(cid:6)õ(cid:2).70
In his recent translation of the upaniùads, Olivelle says dharma in
B(cid:2)U 1.5.23 refers to “ritual and moral laws”.71 However, it is not en-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
instances of dharma in the upaniùads that have been discussed already. Cf. Olivelle,
“The Semantic History,” p.501: “appears ... like a remnant of an old G(cid:7)hyas(cid:4)tra ...”.
67 Already stated in 1.4.17, in which the ritual is ‘interiorised’, see also Heester-
man, “Brahmin, Ritual, and Renouncer,” p.39.

DHARMA 99
tirely clear how something as broad as this can be established from the
immediate context, though it may not be entirely out of the question.
Nor is Horsch’s assertion completely unlikely that there is some con-
nection to the cosmological notion of dharma, despite the incorrect
equation of this particular pr(cid:2)õa with sth(cid:6)õ(cid:2). It is evident, for exam-
ple, that breath ‘supports’ life; the ‘central breath’ (i.e. actual breath-
ing) is clearly given in the text as the basis or foundation of the other
vital functions (pr(cid:2)õas). But there is yet something of greater conse-
quence. The passage continues, ‘indeed it is so today as tomorrow’ (sa
ev(cid:2)dya sa u (cid:3)va), seemingly explained in its own commentary on this
passage as ‘what indeed they (i.e. the gods) undertook then, they do
even today’ (yad v(cid:2) ete ’murhy adhriyanta tad ev(cid:2)py adya kurvanti).72
In emulation of the gods a man ‘should undertake a single observance’
(ekam eva vrataü caret), breathing in (pr(cid:2)õy(cid:2)t) and breathing out
(ap(cid:2)ny(cid:2)t) thinking ‘may evil death not capture me’ (nen m(cid:2) p(cid:2)pm(cid:2)
m(cid:8)tyur (cid:2)pnavad). One should pursue this to the end to win both union
with and the same world as the deity. This breathing emulates the
gods in their own cosmic endeavours. Perhaps in this sense madhyama
pr(cid:2)õa as dharma can be understood as a kind of ‘ritual law’: a vow to
breathe in this devoted manner. The usage of dharma in this passage
may well be an echo of the »gvedic pratham(cid:2)ni dharm(cid:2)ni (see above
p.86): just as the first cosmogonic sacrifice constitutes the ‘first ritual
laws’ which are then emulated on the human plane in each sacrifice,
so here man emulates the gods who first made the central breath (i.e.
the wind) the law and, hence, in observing the vow of breathing in the
described manner, observe the ‘law’ instituted by the gods in their
creative act. We thus return to something like Olivelle’s original as-
sertion. But rather than ‘ritual and moral laws’ in general, perhaps it
designates a particular observance (vrata) as a ritual law (dharma).73
Horsch has suggested that a number of instances of dharma indi-
cate that merit is attached to its performance.74 Thus in both B(cid:2)U
4.4.5 and CU 7.2.1 dharma is coupled with its antonym adharma.75 In
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
72 One might wonder at the significance of the use of the verb (cid:2)dh(cid:8) here.
73 It is worth noting too that vrata and dharma seem to be used synonymously in
GGS 3.1.27 and 3.3.55, see below p.108 n.116. On the convergence between dharma
and vrata, see also Lubin, “Vratá Divine,” p.569 and n.19.
74 Cf. Horsch, “Vom Schöpfungsmythos,” p.53.
75 Rarely found elsewhere in vedic literature (outside of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, which,
of course, are not Veda qua Veda), e.g. V(cid:3)jS 30.10; TB 3.4.6.1; (cid:6)B 5.2.4.13. Cf.
Olivelle, “The Semantic History,” pp.493-4.
100 CHAPTER THREE
B(cid:2)U 4.4.5 the (cid:2)tman, amongst other groups of opposites, is said to
consist (-maya) of dharma and adharma; and in CU 7.2.1 speech
(v(cid:2)k) makes known, also amongst other groups of opposites, dharma
and adharma. Clearly Horsch is correct to note the ‘meritorous’ asso-
ciations of these references, since they obviously indicate ‘good be-
haviour’ and ‘bad behaviour’ and the ‘righteousness’ and ‘unrigh-
teousness’ that consequently attaches to the person. In the B(cid:2)U pas-
sage someone whose actions are good (s(cid:2)dhuk(cid:2)rin) is good (s(cid:2)dhu),
and someone whose actions are bad (p(cid:2)pak(cid:2)rin) is bad (p(cid:2)pa); and in
the CU, speech must be venerated because it makes known the differ-
ence between dharma and adharma, for without speech people would
not know their proper duty, and they may perform adharma out of
ignorance.76 The meanings we can attribute to these applications are
quite abstract however. The actual referents of dharma or adharma,
that is, the actual types of activities considered good and bad, are not
made clear, though we could perhaps surmise from the other instances
of dharma in these texts, and from the list in which it occurs (which
appears much like a catalogue of br(cid:3)hmaõic lore), that it is something
not far from the legalism and duties, the moral and ritual laws, of con-
servative Br(cid:3)hmaõism. The moral tenor of the passage, however, can-
not be questioned. In this light CU 2.1.4 is interesting too: s(cid:2)dhavo
dharm(cid:2)þ, ‘good dharmas’, are said to come to ((cid:2)+(cid:2)gam) a person and
fall to his share (upa+(cid:2)nam), who ‘venerates the S(cid:3)man chant as
good’ (s(cid:2)dhu s(cid:2)mety up(cid:2)ste). The attribution of s(cid:2)dhu to the dharmas
here is part of the word play involved with s(cid:2)man and s(cid:2)dhu,77 yet it is
interesting that it expresses the idea that ‘good dharmas’ are earned
through ‘good’ ritual activity. The notion that dharma can be earned is
not very common in the older literature, though it becomes so later.78
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
76 Cf. V(cid:3)jS 30.10 and TB 3.4.6.1 in which in the puruùamedha a deaf man is said
to be sacrificed to adharma (ádharm(cid:2)ya badhirám). Is this because he is incapable of
hearing dharma and hence cannot know it?
77 Olivelle, The Early Upaniùads, p.538.
78 While in the dharmas(cid:6)tras following dharma or its opposite adharma has con-
sequent merits or benefits (such as heaven), the actual expression of dharma as
‘earned merit’ is quite rare. This seems to be the sense, for example, in GDhS 11.11
where a king is encouraged to maintain his subjects in their varõas and (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas in
keeping with their respective dharmas (11.9-10) for he has ‘a portion of their merit’
(dharmasya hy aü(cid:3)abhag bhavati …). A related example, suggesting a reciprocity in
the performance of dharma, the consequences of which then attach to the person,
occurs in VDhS 5.8, where Indra, after killing the three headed son of Tvaùñ(cid:7), is ma-
hattam(cid:2)dharmasaübaddha, ‘filled with enormous guilt’ (cf. VDhS 3.6 and BDhS
(cid:3)
DHARMA 101
These rare instances may suggest an equivalent semantic shift or em-
phasis beginning to shape the meaning of dharma, reflecting broader
trends in the upaniùads which incorporate serious considerations of
the moral consequences of ‘acting’, and an increasing self-
consciousness in defining the merits of performing ritual activities,
particularly as these issues are expressed in the theory of karma.79
If these developments reveal certain new trends in the application
of dharma, it must still be admitted that dharma is of little signifi-
cance in the older upaniùads, and that when it does occur, it is re-
stricted to something like the traditional duties of conservative Br(cid:3)h-
maõism, not unlike the way it is used in the dharma literature. There
seems to be a clear distinction expressed between these notions of
dharma and some of the ‘new’ ideas found in the upaniùads. It is not
until the KU, for example, that these new ideas are actually called
dharma as well.80 In KU 1.21, in the dialogue between Naciketas and
Death, the (cid:2)tman doctrine is said to be ‘not easily understood, it is a
subtle dharma’ (na … suj(cid:9)eyam aõur eùa dharmaþ), repeated in simi-
lar terms in 2.13 (dharmyam aõum). This is quite remarkable, espe-
cially since this ‘doctrine’ (dharma) is further described as Oý, the
syllable brahman (2.15-16ff.), precisely what CU 2.23.1 contrasts to
dharma.81 The matter is further complicated, however, when KU 2.14
seems to contrast the (cid:2)tman theory to the pair dharma and adharma in
answering the question, what is ‘different from dharma and different
from adharma’ (anyatra dharm(cid:2)d anyatr(cid:2)dharm(cid:2)d). In this case, the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1.1.11 where the reciprocity is expressed in terms of p(cid:2)pa, ‘evil’). Instances of this
usage seem to multiply in MS, usually in reference to an individual’s dharma growing
((cid:2)v(cid:8)dh—2.121; 8.83; 9.111; saü+(cid:2)cin—4.238; 4.242) or disappearing ((cid:2)h(cid:2)—8.74).
MS 8.304 contains the same passage as GDhS 11.11, expressed in terms of dharma
and adharma. In the Mbh it is quite common to see dharma as the object of the verb
(cid:2)(cid:2)p, so that one ‘obtains dharma’. In Manu this is found only once in 11.23, which
expresses something very similar to GDhS 11.11 and MS 8.304, but is probably an
adaptation of the idea of tax as ‘a sixth portion’ since it is in this context that it is
found. Similar constructions are not found in the s(cid:6)tras at all. Such subtleties in the
application and consequent meaning of dharma require further scholarly attention. Cf.
recently M. Hara, “A Note on the Phrase Dharma-Kùetre Kuru-Kùetre,” JIP, 27.1-2
(1999), pp.49-66.

BCE.

102 CHAPTER THREE
‘subtle doctrine’ appears to transcend dharma and adharma, which, if
I understand this correctly, must mean something like the traditional
rituals, laws and duties, and their opposites, of Br(cid:3)hmaõism.82
Later, in KU 4.14, dharma seems to be used in the latter sense
again, where it is also opposed to the (cid:2)tman theory. This passage
draws a contrast between the unity of the (cid:2)tman theory, and the diver-
sity lying at the basis of all wrong conceptions of the truth:
yathodakaü durge v(cid:8)ùñaü parvateùu vidh(cid:2)vati|
evaü dharm(cid:2)n p(cid:8)thak pa(cid:3)yaÁs t(cid:2)n ev(cid:2)nu vidh(cid:2)vati|| 4.14
yathodakaü (cid:3)uddhe (cid:3)uddham (cid:2)siktaü t(cid:2)d(cid:8)g eva bhavati|
evaü muner vij(cid:2)nata (cid:2)tm(cid:2) bhavati gautama|| 4.15
Just as water that has rained down on rough ground runs hither and
thither down the mountain, so one who sees the laws as distinct runs
hither and thither after those very laws. Just as pure water poured into
pure water becomes the very same, so becomes the self of a discerning
sage, Gautama.
The Buddhist influence scholars sometimes perceive in this passage
has been discussed and suitably rejected by Horsch.83 The plural of
dharma surely refers to the various ritual, social and moral obligations
that a member of br(cid:3)hmaõic society must pursue, as the analogous
instances of n(cid:2)n(cid:2)dharma and p(cid:8)thagdharma found elsewhere would
seem to indicate.84 What must be further noted, however, is that this
understanding of dharma is contrasted with another view in 4.15, the
unity implied in the (cid:2)tman theory. The phrasing in 4.14 even suggests
the idea that there is in fact only one true dharma, thus one might
paraphrase: ‘he who sees the laws as distinct, rather than as one…’
This seems to be suggested in the earlier references to the (cid:2)tman the-
ory as ‘the subtle dharma’, which stands over and above the various
rules and obligations (dharmas) of the social world, that is to say,
paraphrasing again, what is ‘other than dharma and adharma, is in
fact the subtle dharma which the (cid:2)tman theory encapsulates’. Such
passages indicate that significant changes have occurred to the refer-
ential scope of dharma. Its normative and binding quality remains in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
82 Cf. Horsch, “Buddhismus und Upaniùaden,” p.474 n.51. The issue, however, is
not transparent, cf. Olivelle, The Early Upaniùads, p.606, note to KU 2.13.
83 “Buddhismus und Upaniùaden,” pp.472-5. Oddly enough, however, the other
references to dharma in KU 1.25, 2.13-14 are not entirely unlike the Buddha’s use of
the word when he describes the entirety of his teaching as ‘the dhamma’.
84 See above p.87 n.21.
DHARMA 103
its abstract application; yet, as it becomes a contested term in disputes
over religious and social values, its referent(s) come to be debated as
well. No longer is it simply assumed that the traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic
understanding of the multiplicity of duties, obligations and laws as
encompassed by dharma are to be tacitly accepted as the authoritative
pronouncement of dharma. The word dharma itself is beginning to
assume the capacity to confer legitimacy, and so, when fundamental
questions are being posed, and past assumptions tested, the question
itself becomes, ‘what is dharma?’
3.1.4 (cid:6)rauta- and g(cid:7)hya-s(cid:4)tras
As with the br(cid:2)hmaõas, some of the instances of dharma found in the
(cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras—texts concerned with a description of the actual proce-
dure of the (cid:3)rauta sacrifices85—are contained in citations from the
saühit(cid:2) literature, or sometimes also from the br(cid:2)hmaõas (e.g. (cid:6)B
13.4.3.14 in (cid:2)(cid:5)v(cid:6)S 10.7.9 and (cid:6)(cid:6)S 16.2.28-30). Indeed these citations
would probably account for all instances of the ‘older’ form dharman
found in this genre.86 But there are also other instances of dharma
found in these texts in a seemingly increasing quantity as the genre
develops. The sense is always rather restricted in comparison with the
expansion of meaning encountered in later literature, such as Manu or
the Mbh, or even in the dharmas(cid:6)tras.
In almost all of these non-citation instances of dharma in the
(cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras, the meaning is something like ‘rule’, ‘ritual rule’, ‘ele-
ments of the sacrifice’ or the ‘characteristics’ of an element in the sac-
rifice. In the B(cid:6)S, considered one of the oldest (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras,87 dharma
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
85 For this genre see J. Gonda, The Ritual S(cid:6)tras, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz,
1977; L. Renou, “Sur le genre du s(cid:4)tra dans la littérature sanskrite,” Journal Asi-
atique, 1963, pp.165-216.
86 E.g. V(cid:6)S 1.2.1; B(cid:6)S 2.18.3; 9.11.1; Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S 1.24.5; 11.11.1; (cid:2)p(cid:6)S 1.23.1;
6.19.1; 12.19.5; 13.8.1-2.
87 V(cid:6)S is considered as old if not older than the B(cid:6)S, and both have much in
common with the br(cid:2)hmaõa literature (see Gonda, The Ritual S(cid:6)tras, pp.522f.; W.
Caland, “Eine zweite Mitteilung (cid:10)ber das V(cid:3)dh(cid:4)las(cid:4)tra,” Acta Orientalia II (1924),
pp.145f. (Kleine Schriften, pp.280f.); A. Parpola, “On the Jaimin(cid:8)ya and V(cid:3)dh(cid:4)la
Traditions of South India and the P(cid:3)õóu/P(cid:3)õóava Problems,” Studia Orientalia, 55
(1984), p.22; Renou, “Sur le genre,” pp.179ff.). A full text of V(cid:6)S has yet to be pub-
lished. From a survey of those parts edited by Caland in the Acta Orientalia (Kleine
Schriften, pp.268-541), and of the recent edition of sections 1.1-4 by M. Sparreboom
and J.C. Heesterman, V(cid:3)dhula has few instances of dharma. Vi(cid:5)va Bandhu’s Vaidika-
pad(cid:2)nukrama-ko(cid:3)a gives only three, one of these (1.2.1) is certainly a mantra citation
(cid:3)
104 CHAPTER THREE
rarely occurs outside of citations and, when it does, tends to be found
in books considered later additions.88 Notable is 24.37.3, atha haika
(cid:2)c(cid:2)ry(cid:2) ek(cid:2)da(cid:3)a dharm(cid:2)n pa(cid:3)ubandha uts(cid:2)dayanti ‘now some teach-
ers do not allow these eleven dharmas in an animal sacrifice’. The
following list of different elements of the sacrificial performance
makes clear that what is meant here is both actual objects used in the
sacrifice as well as individual rites within the sacrifice,89 for example,
‘adding fuel to the fire’ (agnyanv(cid:2)dh(cid:2)na), ‘the taking of the vows’
(vratop(cid:2)yana), ‘the two (cid:2)jyabh(cid:2)ga offerings’ and the taking of
‘Viùõu’s steps’ (viùõukrama).90
A quite different connotation is meant, however, in another rather
curious, and presumably late, stanza from Baudh(cid:3)yana’s pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta
section (29.8):
a(cid:3)raddh(cid:2) paramaþ p(cid:2)pm(cid:2) p(cid:2)pm(cid:2) hy aj(cid:9)(cid:2)nam ucyate|
aj(cid:9)(cid:2)n(cid:2)l lupyate dharmo luptadharmo ’dhamaþ sm(cid:8)taþ||
Lack of faith is the greatest evil, for evil is said to be ignorance; due to
ignorance dharma is violated; one whose dharma has been violated is
considered vile.91
For this genre of literature this is an unusual use of the word dharma
and, in many respects, is typical of later uses of the word.92 Though it
is set in a ritual context, this usage seems to imply not merely ritual
rules and implements, but probably also the whole set of social and
ritual laws which is the duty of a member of br(cid:3)hmaõic society to
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
(= RV.3.17.1a; TB.1.2.1.10a). For interesting comments on the B(cid:6)S’s development of
the s(cid:6)tra genre, see Witzel, “The Development,” pp.316f.
88 See Gonda, The Ritual S(cid:6)tras, p.516, citing W. Caland, Über das rituelle S(cid:6)tra
des Baudh(cid:2)yana, Abhandlungen f(cid:10)r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, XII band No.1,
Nendeln: Kraus, 1966 (11903), pp.6-7.
89 Cf. (cid:2)p(cid:6)S 1.10.18 aupasane (cid:3)rapaõadharm(cid:2) homa(cid:3) ca, ‘the rites of cooking and
offering [take place] in the householder fire’.
90 Much the same sense is probably meant in 24.2.1 p(cid:8)thakp(cid:8)thagdharm(cid:2)þ. In
(cid:7)rautako(cid:3)a (Poona: Vaidika Saü(cid:5)odhana Maõóala, 1962) vol.1 pt.2, p.945, R.N.
Dandekar gives ‘varied equipment’ for this, but does it mean rather all the integral
elements of the sacrifice?
91 This follows an explanation of how to perform the Agnihotra in times of dis-
tress ((cid:2)pad), which conforms to the treatment of the topic of (cid:2)pad in the dharma lit-
erature. It concludes with the statement that this exceptional manner of performing the
Agnihotra should not be undertaken by someone without faith ((cid:3)raddh(cid:2)), which pro-
vides the setting for this (cid:3)loka.
92 Luptadharma seems quite rare. It is also found in MS 8.226 (luptadharma-
kriy(cid:2)), Mbh 1.119.7 (luptadharmakriy(cid:2)c(cid:2)ro); 16.8.28 (aluptadharma), and R(cid:3)m
5.53.16 (luptadharm(cid:2)rthasaügraha).
DHARMA 105
maintain. Similarly, the moral tenor of the verse is unusual. These in-
dications, along with its metre and context, suggest its lateness.
The instance of dharma in B(cid:6)S 24.37.3 is, therefore, more typical
of its application in the (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras. A similar usage of dharma, and
one which is especially typical of later s(cid:6)tras,93 is when certain char-
acteristics, rules or elements of one rite are said to apply to another
rite.94 Often this refers to the situation in which the rules or character-
istics of an archetypal (prak(cid:8)ti) rite are said to apply to its ektypes
(vik(cid:8)ti). Thus it is said that the dharmas of the new and full moon sac-
rifices apply to all vegetal (iùñi) and animal (pa(cid:3)abandhu) sacrifices.95
Sometimes this kind of use refers to a particular element of a sacrifice,
such as an oblation, which retains or gains the characteristics
(dharma) of the corresponding element from another rite.96 On occa-
sion it seems to indicate simply ‘rite’, as in (cid:2)(cid:5)v(cid:6)S 12.8.2 where
dharma has the adjective pr(cid:2)k(cid:8)ti, thus ‘base rite’.97 Sometimes it
would seem that rules of behaviour or usage are intended, as in (cid:2)(cid:5)v(cid:6)S
12.8.1 sattridharm(cid:2)þ, ‘the rules for the participants in the sattra’ or
(cid:6)(cid:6)S 1.1.24 sarveù(cid:2)m (cid:8)ggaõ(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü dharmo ‘the rule for all groups of
(cid:8)cs’.98 The compound dharmam(cid:2)tra, which becomes common in the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
93 According to Caland, “Eine zweite Mitteilung,” p.145 (Kleine Schriften, p.280)
Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S, (cid:2)p(cid:6)S, H(cid:6)S, Vaikh(cid:6)S and to a certain extent M(cid:6)S belong together as a group
in their description of the rites and their style.
94 Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S 7.6.7; 7.6.9; (cid:2)p(cid:6)S 12.7.15-16; 21.3.3; 21.3.10; (cid:2)(cid:5)v(cid:6)S 2.1.24; (cid:6)(cid:6)S
9.27.6; 13.20.11; K(cid:6)S 1.6.12; 4.3.4; 5.11.3; 12.1.1; 13.1.1; 15.9.28. Similarly Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S
1.1.9 and M(cid:6)S 1.1.1.7 declare that the dharmas described for the Full-moon or New-
moon sacrifices apply to both, or are identical. Cf. Olivelle, “The Semantic History,”
pp.501-2.
95 Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S 6.15.5; K(cid:6)S 4.3.2. Of course such a rule enables the brevity of the s(cid:6)tra
form—a characteristic that became more prominent as the genre developed—since it
reduces the need to repeat rules for each new description of a sacrificial performance.
The Soma and Full- and New-moon sacrifices were paradigms for all non-pa(cid:3)u-
bandha sacrifices from a very early period, see Witzel, “The Development,” p.272.
96 Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S 6.15.7; 6.15.12; K(cid:6)S 4.3.16; 4.3.19; 5.8.17; 6.10.17. On similar usages
in M(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3), cf. F.X., Clooney, “The Concept of Dharma in the M(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3) S(cid:4)tras of

later PMS and K(cid:6)S,99 occurs (for the first time?) in (cid:2)p(cid:6)S 19.21.4
dharmam(cid:2)traü (cid:3)rapaõam, ‘cooking is merely a ritual rule’, that is, in
this case the cooking of the offered substance (a hundred k(cid:8)ùõalas) is
not to take place, as it would if the format of the model iùñi rite was
followed to the letter.100
Bh(cid:3)(cid:6)S 9.18.4 contains an interesting usage that may indicate a
broader sense of the term. This passage poses the question, ‘How
should an oblation be recognised as defiled?’ (kathaü duùñaü havir
vidy(cid:2)t):
yad (cid:2)ry(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü dharmaj(cid:9)(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü dharmak(cid:2)m(cid:2)n(cid:2)m abhojan(cid:5)yam na tena
dev(cid:2)n yajeta |
What should not be eaten by (cid:2)ryas who know dharma and are devoted
to dharma, with that one should not offer a sacrifice to the gods.
I have already passed comment above on a passage from the TU that
has much in common with this.101 There are similar passages to this in
other (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras too,102 but Bh(cid:3)radv(cid:3)ja alone makes reference to
dharma. Whether one understands this simply to indicate ‘ritual rules’
or the broader sense of ritual and social rules is not clear, though the
latter seems quite likely. As ever, the ‘social’ and ‘ritual’ seem impli-
cated in each other. It clearly lends itself to being interpreted along the
lines of what Hacker calls the ‘empirical’ nature of dharma, which
becomes important as an epistemic and hermeneutic principle in the
dharmas(cid:6)tras:103 the question of what is proper conduct is adjudicated
through observing the behaviour of particular people who have as-
sumed a position of socio-cultural privilege.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
99 On its numerous occurrences in the PMS, see Clooney, “The Concept of
Dharma,” pp.183f. Its frequency in the K(cid:6)S may be due to its close relationship to the
PMS (see references in n.121 below).

DHARMA 107
If the use of dharma in the (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras is relatively uncommon and
generally restricted in sense, in particular in the earlier s(cid:6)tras,104 then
it is somewhat more surprising how little a role dharma plays in the
g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras, texts which, as has often been noted, share much in
common with the dharmas(cid:6)tras, particularly in their concern for the
saüsk(cid:2)ras.105 A typical example of the use of dharma in these texts is
in the fairly common compound kuladharma, which is used when cer-
tain rites are allowed to vary according to the custom of the family.106
Similar in sense are the compounds janapadadharma, ‘the customs of
regions’, and gr(cid:2)madharma, ‘the customs of villages’, found at
(cid:2)(cid:5)vGS 1.7.1. While occasionally dharman/dharma is found in mantra
citations, which sometimes have vedic origins,107 and on other occa-
sions do not,108 these rarely contribute to an understanding of how the
word was used or understood in these texts.109 These citations account
for every instance of the form dharman in the g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras (though not
all have this form), a fact which may indicate the antiquity even of the
citations not found in the extant Vedas.110
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
104 It is notable how much more common dharma is in a late s(cid:6)tra like K(cid:6)S (see
below n.123).

107 E.g. Bh(cid:3)GS 3.13, cf. T(cid:2) 10.67.1 (MNU 19.2d). Other usages recall vedic con-
texts, as when Varuõa is evoked as dharmapati in (cid:6)GS 4.14.2, cf. above p.93 and
n.46. The mantra in PGS 2.11.12 (found also in slightly different form in B(cid:6)S
8.18.16; (cid:2)(cid:5)v(cid:6)S 6.12.12; (cid:6)(cid:6)S 8.10.1; V(cid:3)itS 23.15; (cid:2)p(cid:6)S 13.18.2; M(cid:6)S 2.5.4.13) is
cited as a »c (cf. Oldenberg’s note to his translation).
108 E.g. (cid:6)GS 3.3.8; (cid:2)pMP 2.15.10 ((cid:2)pGS 7.17.6); PGS 3.4.18, all variants of the
same formula (see n.110 below); and used in the upanayana, mitras tvam asi dhar-
maõ(cid:2) (cid:6)GS 2.3.1; HGS 1.5.10b; (cid:2)pMP 2.3.12 ((cid:2)pGS 4.10.12); JGS 1.12.29. Accord-
ing to Bloomfield this is found also in the Mantra Br(cid:2)hmaõa (1.6.15d) with the vari-
ant karmaõ(cid:2) for dharmaõ(cid:2).
109 The sense of the pr(cid:2)j(cid:2)ptya marriage mantra in (cid:2)(cid:5)vGS 1.6.3 (saha dharmaü
caratam iti pr(cid:2)j(cid:2)patyaþ; 1.4.25 in T. Ganapati Sastri’s ed.) clearly suggests the broad
sense of all br(cid:3)hmaõic social and ritual laws. Cf. BDhS 1.20.3; GDhS 4.7; MS 3.30;
YS 1.60.
110 On this see Renou, Les Écoles, p.42; Gonda, The Ritual S(cid:6)tras, pp.565ff., esp.
p.571. Could there be a deliberate attempt at archaism in these mantras? (cid:6)GS 3.3.8 is
one of two formulas which includes the form dharman but is not found in the Vedas.
Its equivalent in (cid:2)pMP 2.15.10 ((cid:2)pGS 7.17.6) has dharma, while in the PGS version
dharma is the first member of a compound.
These mantras are reminiscent of the erection of the pillar in the Sadas hut (noted
above n.29 p.89) with the ‘firm support’ (dhruveõa dharmaõ(cid:2)) of Mitra and Varuõa.
In this case the central post of the house is erected with a formula that describes the

108 CHAPTER THREE
Uses outside of these instances are quite seldom, particularly in the
older g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras.111 (cid:2)(cid:5)vGS 1.7.12 is typical of many of the instances
found in the (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras: eùo ’vad(cid:2)nadharmaþ, ‘this is the rule for
the portion cut off [from the oblation]’. The same text contains a ref-
erence (3.4.4) to dharm(cid:2)c(cid:2)ryas ‘teachers of dharma’, but, as Hopkins
has suggested, this is likely to be a later insertion, given that it also
refers to the Bh(cid:2)rata and the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, and that it is a variation
from a parallel passage in (cid:6)GS 4.10.3 which makes no mention of any
of these despite its overall similarity prior to and after the members of
the list in question.112 Elsewhere, there is a rare reference to adharma
in GGS 3.1.15 in which at the beginning of the god(cid:2)navrata113 the stu-
dent is told ‘Obey your teacher except in improper (non-dharmic)
conduct’ ((cid:2)c(cid:2)ry(cid:2)dh(cid:5)no bhav(cid:2)nyatr(cid:2)dharmacaraõ(cid:2)t). Injunctive in-
stances of dharma are rare. One such case may be (cid:6)GS 2.16.2, a (cid:3)loka
concerning the proper conduct towards a teacher ((cid:2)c(cid:2)rya), father
(pit(cid:2)) and friend (sakh(cid:2)) which ends with the declaration iti dharmo
vidh(cid:5)yate ‘this is established as dharma’. Gonda has noted that 2.16.1
and 3 are both found in the MS,114 and that this fact along with their
(cid:3)loka metre and their position at the end of the section suggest that
they are late inclusions.115 Finally, GGS 3.1.27 calls the list of duties
to be performed by the student undergoing the one year god(cid:2)navrata
as nityadharma ‘obligatory duties’,116 a usage that would clearly not
be out of place in the dharma literature.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
‘chief post’ (sth(cid:6)õar(cid:2)ja) as ‘the law’ (dharma). The post and the law stand in a meta-
phorical relationship to each other.
111 Like the late K(cid:6)S, the later g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras, such as the (cid:2)gniGS and the K(cid:3)ñhGS,
tend to use the word more frequently, with somewhat different usages (note e.g. the
frequency of the stereotyped phrase dharmo vy(cid:2)khy(cid:2)taþ in K(cid:3)ñhGS 66.1, 67.1, 68.1
and 69.1).

115 The Ritual S(cid:6)tras, p.607, though they are not, he suggests, necessarily bor-
rowed from the MS: “The probabilities are … that (cid:6)(cid:3)ïkh(cid:3)yana quoted from floating
sayings ascribed to Manu [as in 2.16.1] and … reproduced rules of conduct that …
may have belonged to widespread oral traditions.”
116 This is probably synonymous with nityavrata. Cf. e.g. GGS 3.3.55 in which the
student who learns the jyeùñh(cid:2)s(cid:2)mans must undertake obligatory vows (nityavrata)
such as not having sex with a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra woman, not eating bird flesh and so on. A conver-
gence between vratá and dhárman seems to occur as early as the »gveda, see e.g.
Lubin, “Vratá Divine,” p.569 and n.19.
DHARMA 109
3.1.5 Towards the dharmas(cid:4)tras
It is apparent from this brief survey, that in both the (cid:3)rauta- and
g(cid:8)hya-s(cid:6)tras, the literature which both precedes and/or was composed
at a similar time to the early dharmas(cid:6)tras,117 dharma, while not un-
important, had none of the central significance of later times. Its most
typical application in the (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras clearly has ‘normative’ implica-
tions, and thus can be seen to have something in common with other
usages. However its scope is clearly restricted and any usage having
wider implications seems not to be part of the oldest sections of these
texts. The restriction in meaning in the g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras is of a different
order. Here, rather than having the prescriptive force that becomes
more and more common in the dharma literature, it is primarily de-
scriptive. Accordingly, it is often said a rite may vary according to a
custom (dharma) of a region, a usage that appears already in the
AV.118
To return to the initial point of departure which began this survey, two
main points must be stressed: i. within the br(cid:3)hmaõic world, a thor-
ough description of social duties, obligations, customs and laws, be-
yond (but not excluding) the ritual sphere, was not of concern until the
very late vedic period, in the second half of the last millenium BCE;
ii. the word dharma first became significant in conferring conceptual
legitimacy on codes of behaviour at around the same time or later. The
significant moment in the br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition registering both these
developments was the rise of a new genre of literature, the dharma-
s(cid:6)tras.
While the literature preceding the dharmas(cid:6)tras had only a limited
purview, and therefore gives only a glimpse of the broader social
world—which the br(cid:2)hmaõas and (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras especially leave be-
hind—and also gives only rare expression to the idea of dharma, the
dharmas(cid:6)tras can, however, be considered to draw upon many of the
traits of the usage of dharma in this earlier literature. The dharma-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
117 While the general chronology of (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tra-g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tra-dharmas(cid:6)tra is ac-
cepted amongst scholars, it is not a rigid chronology, rather considerable overlap is to
be expected between each genre (Gonda, The Ritual S(cid:6)tras, pp.471, 554f.).
118 See p.87 and n.21 above. Such usages corroborate Lariviere (“Dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stra,
Custom, ‘Real Law’ and ‘Apocryphal’ Sm(cid:7)tis,” JIP, 32 (2004), pp.611-27) and
Wezler (“Dharma in the Veda and the Dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stras,” JIP, 32 (2004), pp.629-54),
who argue that the dharma of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra was originally based on ‘custom’.
110 CHAPTER THREE
s(cid:6)tras represent a combination, extensive development and codifica-
tion of all those elements of dharma occurring in the literature preced-
ing (and, in part, co-originating with) them: the idea of ‘customs’ evi-
dent already in the AV, and later in the g(cid:8)hyas(cid:6)tras; the application of
dharma in respect to ritual in the (cid:3)rautas(cid:6)tras, which has precedence
as far back as the RV; the ‘duty lists’ evident in the (cid:6)B and early
upaniùads; and its association with jurisprudence and the administra-
tion of society, especially when combined with aspects of kingship in
the br(cid:2)hmaõas and upaniùads (and also V(cid:3)jS). All the while dharma
maintains its normative and binding character, something evident al-
ready in its use as the ‘instrument’ of various gods, particularly Va-
ruõa, in the saühit(cid:2) period, when they are called on to exercise their
divinity.
It might be said that the relative insignificance attributed to dharma
in the literature prior to the dharmas(cid:6)tras is only to be expected. The
concerns of these texts were restricted to the ritualism of the sacrifice
and therefore they do not offer a complete picture of vedic society.119
The ‘socially’ oriented rules and laws typical of the dharmas(cid:6)tras,
therefore, found little place in these texts.120 This in itself is worth re-
marking upon: there was very little formal codification of social rules
prior to the period of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, though it seems, if we take in
the limited occurrences of the word in the br(cid:2)hmaõa literature, or
even the AV, that this social aspect was already partly developed in
respect to dharma. Yet, perhaps more significantly, the restricted us-
age of the word requires attention too, in as much as the ritual de-
scribed in the saühit(cid:2)s and br(cid:2)hmaõas is not explained or understood
in terms of dharma. For almost the entire vedic period, dharma is not
the key gauge of legitimacy, as it is later. It is worth noting, by con-
trast, the centrality that the word has in the opening s(cid:6)tras of Jaimini’s
PMS, a text which grows out of the tradition of the kalpas(cid:6)tras, and in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
119 Cf. J. Gonda, Change and Continuity in Indian Religion, Delhi: Munshiram
Manoharlal, 1985 (11965), p.200.
120 Such rules and laws, however, were not entirely absent from earlier texts, see
e.g. S. Jamison, The Ravenous Hyenas and the Wounded Sun. Myth and Ritual in
Ancient India, Ithaca/London: Cornell University Press, 1991, pp.212-21, who sug-
gests that “a legal code of fairly rigid formulation must have been in existence and
well-known already at the time of the composition of early Vedic prose” (p.221). It is
interesting, however, that the passages she discusses do not employ the word dharma.
DHARMA 111
particular the (cid:3)rauta- and dharma-s(cid:6)tras.121 The concern of the PMS is
the exegesis of vedic ritualism, and, in doing so, to justify the Veda as
the single authority on dharma. PMS 1.1.1 describes its purpose as
dharmajij(cid:9)(cid:2)s(cid:2), an ‘inquiry into dharma’, and dharma is then defined
in 1.1.2 as ‘the object indicated by vedic injunction’ (codan(cid:2)lakùaõo
’rtho dharmo).122 By this stage, then, vedic ritualism is defined in
terms of dharma. To learn the Veda and come to an understanding of
its purpose is now to come to an understanding of dharma.123
If we pay attention to the way in which the word is used in the
dharmas(cid:6)tras themselves, it always seems to refer to some specific
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
121 A. Parpola, “On the formation of the M(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3) and the Problems concerning
Jaimini with particular reference to the teacher quotations and the Vedic schools,”
WZKS, 25 (1981), pp.164f., 171f.; Clooney, “The Concept of Dharma,” pp.176f. The
PMS especially rises out of the paribh(cid:2)ùa sections of the kalpas(cid:6)tras according to
Renou in L. Renou and J. Filliozat, L’Inde Classique, tome 2, Paris: J. Maisonneuve,
1985, p.9; for another view cf. Parpola, ibid., pp.171f. The date of the PMS has yet to
be settled, though most scholars lean towards the last centuries BCE.
122 The similarity between these s(cid:6)tras and the opening s(cid:6)tra of VDhS, as Olivelle
has noted in The Dharmas(cid:6)tras, p.390, is surely not by chance: ath(cid:2)taþ puruùa-
niþ(cid:3)reyas(cid:2)rtham dharmajij(cid:9)(cid:2)s(cid:2)| On these two PMS s(cid:6)tras see also Clooney, “The
Concept of Dharma,” pp.179f. and passim.
S.C. Chakrabarti, in “On the Transition of the Vedic Sacrificial Lore,” IIJ, 21
(1979), p.186, makes the odd statement (in regard to a comment by A. Parpola, The
(cid:7)rauta-S(cid:6)tras of L(cid:2)ñy(cid:2)yana and Dr(cid:2)hy(cid:2)yaõa and their commentaries. An English
translation and study, Helsinki, I 1968, p.59) that “the earliest record” of dharma-
jij(cid:9)(cid:2)sa “goes back to the Yajurveda-Br(cid:3)hmaõa period”, apparently basing this on the
appearance of the word m(cid:5)m(cid:2)üs(cid:2) in these texts. This is surely a case of reading back
into an earlier period what one finds in a later period. There is no occurrence of such a
compound in the br(cid:2)hmaõas and, indeed, as discussed, dharma seems to occur there
in a less ritualistic context than in the s(cid:6)tras. That the inquiry into the meaning of the
ritual is understood to mean an inquiry into dharma is a later expression that indicates
the rise in significance of the word dharma.
123 Cf. Halbfass, India and Europe, p.325, “The treatment of dharma in the P(cid:4)rva-
m(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3) is more significant [than other ‘Hindu’ dar(cid:3)anas] and has had a greater
historical impact. Here, ‘orthodox’ Hinduism found its most uncompromising expres-
sion. In a sense, its major ‘philosophical’ achievement is its method of shielding the
Vedic dharma from the claims of philosophical, i.e., argumentative and universalizing
thought, its demonstration that it cannot be rationalized or universalized within the
framework of argumentative and epistemologically oriented thought, and its uncom-
promising linkage of dharma to the sources of the sacred tradition and the identity of
the Aryan.”
It is notable that in the K(cid:6)S, a text that post-dates and is influenced by Jaimini (see
A. Parpola “On the formation of the M(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3) and the Problems concerning Jaimini
with particular reference to the teacher quotations and the Vedic schools (part II),”
WZKS, 25 (1994), pp.293-308), the instances of dharma outside of vedic citations
seem to multiply, e.g. 1.6.12; 1.8.7; 4.3.2; 4.3.4; 4.3.16; 4.3.19; 4.12.16; 5.8.17;
5.11.3; 6.10.17; 7.2.21; 8.2.19; 9.5.10; 12.1.1; 13.1.1; 15.9.28. On dharma and the
M(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3) cf. also Wezler “Dharma in the Veda,” p.633.
112 CHAPTER THREE
type of behaviour which has consequences especially for society and,
usually only implicitly, for the cosmos. This has been eloquently de-
scribed by Halbfass:124
Dharma … is neither a “natural” order immanent in the subsistence of
the world nor an “objective” transcendental order and lawfulness. In-
stead, it is the continuous maintaining of the social and cosmic order
and norm which is achieved by the Aryan through the performance of
vedic rites and traditional duties.
The old cosmological idea of dharma as a principle of ‘support’ is
therefore not absent from these developments.125 It is, however, quite
incorrect to say, as many scholars do, particularly when they assume
dharma takes over the idea of (cid:8)ta, that dharma is ‘cosmic order’ it-
self.126 Rather, it finds its expression in the rigidly codified behaviour
of individuals who support the social order by performing the duties
incumbent upon them according to this code. Thus the pathology of
dharma is expressed through the intermixture (saükara) of either
varõa or dharma.127 While the cosmic consequences of this remain
only barely implied in the early dharmas(cid:6)tras, which spare little space
for things cosmic at any rate, in Manu it is made quite explicit. This is
especially so in the first book which contains the cosmogony that
forms the mythic frame of the MS. The creation of the cosmos in-
volved the distinguishing (vi+(cid:2)vic) of the various activities (karman)
of each product of that creation (1.26ff., 41ff.). In a reprisal of the Pu-
ruùas(cid:6)kta (RV 10.90), this includes the four varõas (1.31, 87ff.)
which are assigned separate activities (p(cid:8)thakkarm(cid:2)õi) ‘for the protec-
tion of this entire creation’ (sarvasya asya … sargasya guptyarthaü).
Manu further says that the performance of ‘rites to the gods’ ‘supports
this movable and immovable [creation]’ (bibhart(cid:5)daü car(cid:2)caram).
There is, however, a somewhat ambivalent symbiosis between dharma
and its upholding, thus in MS 8.15 it is said ‘dharma destroys if it is
violated, and preserves if it is preserved’ (dharma eva hato hanti
dharmo rakùati rakùitaþ). As Halbfass has suggested, this “‘causal

This fear is expressed in other ways as well, thus in BDhS 1.2.13 the regions which lie
on the borders of (cid:2)ry(cid:2)varta (see below p.115) are full of peoples of ‘mixed birth’
(saük(cid:5)rõayonayaþ).
DHARMA 113
ambivalence’ … is highly significant. Dharma itself is that upholding
which is incumbent on qualified men; but it is also the condition under
which such upholding is possible. It protects its protectors.”128
The dharmas(cid:6)tra genre, which for the first time affords centrality
to the word dharma and to the various rules which make up dharma,
indicates the beginning of quite a new period in br(cid:3)hmaõic reflection.
This view is reinforced by other changes which this genre heralds. The
rules contained within the dharmas(cid:6)tras represent a break from the
strict school alignment found in both the vedic period and the (cid:3)rauta-
and g(cid:8)hya-s(cid:6)tras since, for the most part, they are deemed applicable
to all regardless of vedic (cid:3)(cid:2)kh(cid:2), a feature they share with some other
ved(cid:2)ïgas.129 Furthermore, only three of the dharmas(cid:6)tras are actually
contained within the school-based kalpas(cid:6)tras: (cid:2)pastamba, Hiraõya-
ke(cid:5)in (which is in all cases based closely on (cid:2)pastamba) and Bau-
dh(cid:3)yana. The Gautama and Vasiùñha dharmas(cid:6)tras are not connected
with a kalpas(cid:6)tra and only loosely with a (cid:3)(cid:2)kh(cid:2).130 These texts mark,
as Olivelle has said, “the emergence of eponymous literature … the
ascription of treatises to eminent persons of the mythical past”.131
While the beginning of the dharma literature with the dharmas(cid:6)tras
marks a change of direction in the br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition, and the proper
beginning of the development of dharma into becoming the central
category of Br(cid:3)hmaõism/Hinduism, this does not mean that these texts
use the word dharma with the expansiveness typical of the later pe-
riod. Indeed, in comparison with later times, its meaning is still sub-
ject to some restriction, a restriction indicating its capacity to confer
legitimacy, but a legitimacy tied to an assertion of br(cid:3)hmaõic identity
intimately bound up with conservative Br(cid:3)hmaõism. The free applica-
tion of the word dharma in the Mbh, by characters such as Yudhi-
ùñhira, to kinds of behaviour outside of strict br(cid:3)hmaõical norms

Authority of the Veda in India,” JAAR, 60 (1992), p.64. That is not to say that they

respects, and take some effort to record different points of view, see Olivelle,

would probably seem quite strange to the authors of these texts.132 For
the br(cid:3)hmans who composed the dharmas(cid:6)tras, dharma encompassed
the social world of activity, of obligations and of sacrifice, and at its
very centre was the g(cid:8)hastha, the householder who alone could main-
tain the fire which is the locus of the g(cid:8)hya rites and who could be the
patron of the opulent (cid:3)rauta rites. Consequently, the renunciant tradi-
tions, which frequently questioned these aspects of the br(cid:3)hmaõic
world view, were viewed with considerable diffidence, particularly in
the early dharmas(cid:6)tras.133 Over a period of time there was a great ex-
pansion in the application of the word, a process perhaps given impe-
tus by and, we could speculate, probably existing in a dialectical rela-
tionship to, its adoption by the Buddhists,134 and in which other figures
such as the Emperor A(cid:5)oka figured large.
The adoption of the concept for use in other contexts, along with
the rapid geographic expansion of br(cid:3)hmaõic culture, may perhaps be
behind a number of self-conscious attempts in the dharma literature to
establish the epistemological and hermeneutical foundations of
dharma. This can be seen, for example, in what Hacker has described
as the “radically empirical” nature of dharma,135 the demarcation of
‘the conduct of the (cid:2)ryas’ as its standard and source of authority.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
132 Note, for example, (cid:2)DhS 2.26.14, in which a king should exempt ‘ascetics de-
voted to the law’ (tapasvina(cid:3) ca ye dharmapar(cid:2)þ) from taxes. This implies that there
were, of course, ascetics not devoted to dharma. Dharma in this case must mean pre-
cisely those rules and obligations described in the s(cid:6)tras, i.e. what I am calling ‘the
conservative’ notion of br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma. Accordingly, Yudhiùñhira’s proposal to
renounce because of dharma, explored in the next chapter, would mean for the au-
thors of these texts precisely that he would have become an ascetic not devoted to
dharma, since it would have involved the willful abrogation of his svadharma.
133 The situation is different however in the last two books of BDhS, which are
considered later additions. Olivelle convincingly argues this also for 2.17 and 2.18.
Cf. Olivelle, Dharmas(cid:6)tras, p.127 and the references there to B(cid:10)hler and Kane; and
on BDhS 2.17-18 the same author “Renouncer and renunciation,” pp.87f. and The
(cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, New York, Oxford: OUP, 1993, pp.86ff.
134 According to Olivelle’s most recent datings (The Dharms(cid:6)tras, pp.xxvi-xxxiv;
see above p.37 n.4), all of the dharmas(cid:6)tras would be post-Buddhist. If his dates are
accepted, it may be that the founding of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra genre with the dharma-
s(cid:6)tras was a reclamation of a concept that had its origins in Vedism but which was
given new weight and range by the Buddha. Cf. now Olivelle, “The Semantic His-
tory,” pp.504-6.
135 “Dharma im Hinduismus,” pp.98f. Houben (“To kill or not to kill,” p.112, and
n.11) has rightly criticised this terminology. Hacker’s important point, however, was
to draw attention to the fact that this conception of dharma was based on the observed
conduct of specific kinds of people. See also Lariviere, “Dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stra, Custom,” and
Wezler, “Dharma in the Veda.”
DHARMA 115
Thus (cid:2)pDhS 1.20.7-8 asserts that ‘the activity which the (cid:2)ryas praise
is dharma, that which they reproach is adharma. One should engage
in conduct the like of which is unanimously approved in all regions
among (cid:2)ryas who have been properly trained, are elderly, self pos-
sessed, who are neither greedy nor deceitful.’136 Similarly, BDhS 1.2.9
and VDhS 1.8-10 (cf. also MS 2.17ff.) designate (cid:2)ry(cid:2)varta as the re-
gion where authoritative dharma and conduct ((cid:2)c(cid:2)ra) are found.137
But the relationship of dharma to the Veda posed problems too.
The lack of attention the Vedas pay to rules of a social and juridical
orientation (as opposed to simply rules for the sacrifice, saüsk(cid:2)ras
and so on) as presented in the dharma literature did not go unnoticed
by the authors of that literature. Among contemporary scholars, this
has, of course, been famously acknowledged by Renou, as well as oth-
ers.138 (cid:2)pastamba states in his opening s(cid:6)tras (1.1.1-3) that his con-
cern is ‘customary laws’ (s(cid:2)may(cid:2)c(cid:2)rik(cid:2)n dharm(cid:2)n), the authority
(pram(cid:2)õa) for which is founded upon what is agreed upon among
those who know dharma (dharmaj(cid:9)asamaya) and upon the Veda. The
other dharmas(cid:6)tras provide a far more rigid criteria: for Gautama
dharma is based on the Veda, the sm(cid:8)ti and customs of those who
know the Veda;139 Baudh(cid:3)yana articulates a graded criteria, firstly
‘dharma is taught in each Veda’, ‘secondly it is based on the tradition,
and thirdly on the practices of the learned’;140 and for Vasiùñha dharma
is ordained in the Veda and tradition, and when these fail, upon the
practices of cultured people.141 There is, then, an increasingly insistent
attempt to base the authority of dharma on the Veda. But if dharma in

actual practice is based on custom, on empirically observed phe-
nomena, but is ‘theologically’ derived from the Veda,142 and in most
cases can be demonstrably shown to have nothing to do with the
Veda, then how is this apparent tension resolved?143 In order to ac-
count for this, and to derive all dharma from the Veda, (cid:2)pastamba
proposes an important hermeneutical principle, the idea of the ‘lost
Veda’, which is inferred from the existence of the actual customs
found among people.144 The definition of the (cid:3)iùña, already noted as
one of the sources (m(cid:6)la) of dharma in both Baudh(cid:3)yana and Va-
siùñha, is important in this regard too. Thus for Baudh(cid:3)yana the (cid:3)iùñas
are those who have ‘studied the Veda and its supplements in accor-
dance with dharma, know how to draw inferences from them, and are
able to give cause with reference to vedic texts’.145
These hermeneutical principles suggest that, if the codification of
the dharmas(cid:6)tras represents the assembling together of all br(cid:3)hmaõic
ideas in respect of dharma, at the same time there were other forces at
work which posed a threat to those engaged in this process. We will
now briefly describe some of these forces, the influence of which
would be felt increasingly in the dharmas(cid:6)tras and, eventually, in the
ideological struggle between Yudhiùñhira and his family with which
we shall soon be concerned, a struggle that forms the narrative frame
to the (cid:2)DhP.

142 Cf. Olivelle, Dharmas(cid:6)tras, p.xxxix, and n.135 above.
143 The problem is further complicated, as Olivelle has noted (Dharmas(cid:6)tras,
pp.xl-xli): if purveù(cid:2)m and mahat(cid:2)m in (cid:2)pDhS 2.13.7 and GDhS 1.3 respectively
refer to persons mentioned in the Veda, then the s(cid:6)tras do not even sanction all things
found therein, the strength of those men, and the weakness of men of later times, be-
ing given as the reasons that the ‘transgressions of law’ (dharmavyatikrama) and ‘vio-
lence’ (s(cid:2)hasa) of the men of former times are not sanctioned for later ages. Such
thinking has been taken as the foundation for the kalivarjya theory of the decline of
the ages, see e.g. R. Lingat, “Time and Dharma (on Manu I, 85-86),” CIS, 6 (1962),
pp.7-16, esp. pp.9ff. For an alternative view, however, see Rocher, “The Introduction

3.2 The crisis and renewal of Br(cid:2)hmaõism:
the ascetic and the g(cid:7)hastha
Yudhiùñhira, we shall shortly see, expresses his desire to lead a non-
violent life in terms of dharma. What, then, is this dharma? And from
where does it arise? Whilst the conservative tradition of dharma was
being developed in br(cid:3)hmaõic circles which focused on the house-
holder (g(cid:8)hastha)—the hub around whom the vedic world re-
volved—at much the same time other traditions were emerging which
shifted their focus away from the previously dominant ideology of the
sacrifice. In the current section we will briefly review some of these
developments, the reaction to them in the conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic tra-
dition of dharma, and some of the historical circumstances which
seem to have accompanied or precipitated their rise. There has been
much material produced on these aspects of the Indian tradition, hence
there will be no need to treat them in great length here.
At least since Dumont’s famous article “World Renunciation in In-
dian Religions”,146 scholars have discussed the contrasts, tensions and
complementarities between the renunciant and ‘in-the-world’ elements
of Indian culture. Whilst not completely ignoring the historical cir-
cumstances of the rise of renunciation, and the initial response in br(cid:3)h-
maõic circles, Dumont highlights the integration of renunciation or
asceticism into Br(cid:3)hmaõism and its later manifestations in Hinduism,
and the dialogue between the householder and the ascetic once this
integration had been achieved.147 I am concerned here, however, with
the specific context that saw the rise of these new movements and, in
particular, with the conflicts which their emergence brought about
within the conservative folds of Br(cid:3)hmaõism itself.
At around the middle of the first millenium BCE great changes were
taking place in northern India.148 This period saw the growth of ur-
banisation in the emerging cities and states along the Ganges and Ya-
muna rivers and surrounding areas, accompanied by an increasingly

centralised distribution of political power,149 and greater sophistication
in technology (particularly in the use of iron) and administration.150 At
the same time various groups were emerging which often defined
themselves in opposition to Br(cid:3)hmaõism. The most famous of these,
of course, came to be known as the religions of Buddhism and Jain-
ism. But even within Br(cid:3)hmaõism new movements are clearly dis-
cernible in the doctrines articulated in the upaniùads, the earliest of
which predate the earliest P(cid:3)li (Buddhist) texts,151 even though, in
their earliest examples, they very much grew out of the br(cid:2)hmaõas,
constituting a re-imagining of the world view contained in those texts.
These movements, which placed an emphasis on individualism and
renunciation, seem to have been associated with the new urban envi-
ronments which were able to generate a surplus in order to support
them, since frequently the mendicant pursuits they engaged in were
not economically productive in themselves.152
These new movements represented a new set of values that stood in
opposition to the institution of the sacrifice and, significantly, placed
into question the central figure of br(cid:3)hmaõic ideology, the house-
holder (g(cid:8)hastha). The wandering ascetic came to be an exalted figure
who lived in the wilderness outside the village. Or else, as in Bud-
dhism, renunciation was institutionalised in the creation of monastic
communities. The effect, nevertheless, was the same; both renuncia-

dent, for example, in the monastery found at Kau(cid:5)(cid:3)mb(cid:8), see Erdosy, Urbanisation,

DHARMA 119
tion per se and the monastic environment excluded the possibility of
the householder’s life. Typically, this renunciation involved a new
understanding of ‘life in the world’ (saüs(cid:2)ra) as something to be es-
caped from. The old goal of sacrificial behaviour, heaven (svarga),
was superseded by a new soteriological goal, liberation from the
world into which one was continually reborn (mokùa, nirv(cid:2)õa).
Alongside these new developments the new ethical doctrine of karma
(karman) also arose, the idea that performing actions bound one to a
continuing cycle of rebirths. Since in the vedic world view the sacri-
fice was the action par excellence, this created a conundrum for the
householder, for his ritual activity came to be seen as the cause of his
bondage to the world; hence, later, renunciation in the br(cid:3)hmaõic tra-
dition came to mean especially the renunciation of ritual activity.153
Other developments would further problematise the vedic sacrifi-
cial tradition. The various renunciant movements gave primacy to
celibacy, thereby problematising another main feature of the house-
holder’s life, his duty to marry and procreate.154 Furthermore, the idea
of ahiüs(cid:2), ‘non-injury’, which was to become a prominent feature of
both Buddhism and Jainism, but was a central tenet of all renunciant
traditions, questioned the actual killing of animals in the sacrifice,155
even if ahiüs(cid:2)’s vedic or non-vedic origins are disputed.156 The con-
sequences of these new values, especially that of ahiüs(cid:2) and the
karma theory, would be even more pronounced for kùatriyas, for, as
Gombrich has pointed out, if “violence is always wrong, this calls into

question the traditional role performance of the kùatriya, the legitimate
use of force”.157
If in Buddhism and Jainism the sacrifice was rejected as a worth-
while soteriological pursuit, the same could not be said for the early
upaniùads. Yet often these texts also presented an alternative path that
stood in distinction from the sacrifice. Thus the much discussed pas-
sage found in a number of upaniùads which contrasts the ‘way of the
gods’ (devay(cid:2)na) with ‘the way of the fathers’.158 In the former those
who live in the wilderness and pursue austerities do not return, while
in the latter those who live in villages and sacrifice are reborn again
and again. When this passage is repeated in later upaniùads the rejec-
tion of the efficacy of the sacrifice becomes even more radical.159
It is often suggested that the challenge to br(cid:3)hmaõic orthodoxy of
these new upaniùadic ideas is reflected in their being placed in the
mouths of kùatriyas or kings. For Olivelle, who notes also the simi-
larly ‘noble’ origin of the Buddha and Jina, this seems to be in order
to align these new doctrines, and the br(cid:3)hmans who preserved them,
with the urban-living nobility, and thereby distinguish them from the
‘old world’ of vedic knowledge, the locus of which is the village.160
One could equally say that the sympathy of the politically and eco-
nomically powerful nobility would have had obvious benefits too. For
Bronkhorst, on the other hand, it indicates that these ideas are in fact
non-vedic in origin, and their putatively noble conception is a strategy
which aims not to alienate br(cid:3)hmaõic orthodoxy by making the teach-
ers of these ideas come from the only group comparable in power to
br(cid:3)hmans. He also suggests that the “Vedic garb” of some of these
ideas, and the desire to describe them with “Vedic terminology”, per-
form similar functions.161

(1995), pp.162-4.
DHARMA 121
Though there is yet to be a consensus on the origins of renunciant
asceticism—scholars dividing between those who see these move-
ments as developments external to vedic religion and others who see
them as orthogenetic developments out of the vedic sacrificial ideolo-
gies162—and though the upaniùads and later dharma literature to some
extent accommodate these new ideas and movements,163 it is quite
clear that the earliest dharma literature viewed the new movements
with considerable animosity, even in those cases where they were ac-
cepted as valid pursuits. A less than favourable attitude towards what
Bronkhorst calls ‘vedic ascetics’ is already evident in a passage from
AB 7.13, which criticises them for avoiding their procreative duty.164
The critical attitude of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, however, is far more pro-
nounced, no doubt partly due to the growing influence of these
movements at the time when the dharmas(cid:6)tras were being composed,
as also to the particular orientation of the dharma texts, which, for the
first time in br(cid:3)hmaõic scholasticism, pay close and systematic atten-
tion to the wider social sphere. Indeed, it would seem that the
dharmas(cid:6)tras betray the great difficulties that conservative br(cid:3)hmans
were having with the new changes that were occurring around them.
In this regard it is worth noting that the dharmas(cid:6)tras exhibit a certain
distrust of the urban environments which accompanied the rise of the
new movements. (cid:2)pDhS 1.32.21 instructs br(cid:3)hmans not to enter cities
(nagara), and BDhS 2.6.31 and 33 say that a ‘righteous man’ (dh(cid:2)r-
mika) lives in a village (gr(cid:2)ma), while living in a city (nagara) would
render him incapable of attaining his spiritual accomplishments (sid-
dhi). Similarly, GDhS 16.45 and VDhS 13.11 suggest that vedic reci-
tation should be suspended in cities (nagara).165
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
162 For an overview, see J. Bronkhorst, The Two Sources, who speaks of vedic and
non-vedic ascetics (not always without problems). Heesterman has in particular pre-
sented the position that asceticism is an orthogenetic development from the vedic
religion, e.g. “Householder and Wanderer,” CIS, ns. 15 (1981), pp.251-71 and
“Brahmin, ritual, and renouncer”.
163 It is worth noting in this respect that while the upaniùads are considered part of
the vedic tradition, in the words of Bronkhorst, The Two Sources, pp.61f.: these “new
doctrines that make their appearance in the early Upaniùads—and which, I propose,
were borrowed from non-Vedic currents—did not radically change the Vedic tradi-
tion. The Upaniùads remained, quite on the contrary, marginal.” See also his com-
ments beneath this citation.

122 CHAPTER THREE
Even though both the GDhS and BDhS166 give a limited account of
renunciation in their discussions of the (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas, both reject it as an
option. While it appears that the GDhS acknowledges the existence of
four (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas, which include bhikùu and vaikh(cid:2)nasa, two words that
denote different forms of ascetic practice, Gautama reports this view
as the opinion of others (eke).167 Once he has briefly given an account
of each (cid:2)(cid:3)rama, he asserts that there is really only one, the house-
holder, because it alone is ‘explicitly prescribed’ (pratyakùavidh(cid:2)n(cid:2)d)
in vedic texts.168 (Proto-) Baudh(cid:3)yana gives an account of the (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas
in the context of discussing the householder. His rejection of the
(cid:2)(cid:3)ramas, which includes the v(cid:2)naprastha and parivr(cid:2)jaka, two other
common designations of ascetics, is more strident even than Gau-
tama’s, for he asserts that there can be no division of dharma whatso-
ever. Indeed he attributes such a view to the demon Kapila. For Baud-
h(cid:3)yana, the householder is also the only (cid:2)(cid:3)rama, since the others do
not provide for procreation.169 Baudh(cid:3)yana’s argument also involves
some interesting vedic hermeneutics. In his initial description of the
position of those ‘some’ (eke) who assert the fourfold division of
dharma (2.11.9), a vedic text (TS 5.7.2.3) is cited speaking of the
‘four paths leading to the gods’, thereby supposedly supporting the
position on the division of dharma (2.11.11-12).170 Baudh(cid:3)yana re-
sponds, however, that there is no vedic text supporting this position
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
166 I speak here of the earliest sections of the BDhS up to 2.16, what Olivelle calls
‘proto-Baudh(cid:3)yana’, see above p.114 n.133. The dharmas(cid:6)tras’ formulation of the
(cid:2)(cid:3)ramas is not that of the classical system, as Olivelle has shown, rather they are life-
time options adopted after the student period. See P. Olivelle, “The notion of (cid:2)(cid:3)rama
in the Dharmas(cid:4)tras,” WZKS, 18 (1974), pp.27-35; Olivelle, The (cid:4)(cid:3)rama System.
167 GDhS 3.1. For Gautama’s position, see Olivelle, “Renouncer and renuncia-
tion,” pp.85ff.; The (cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, pp.83ff.; Bronkorst, The Two Sources, pp.30ff.,
who also discusses the meaning of bhikùu and vaikh(cid:2)nasa.
168 GDhS 3.36 (see Olivelle’s note to this s(cid:6)tra). Even in his account of the four
(cid:2)(cid:3)ramas he says (3.3) ‘the householder is the source of the others, because there is no
procreation among them’ (teù(cid:2)ü g(cid:8)hastho yonir aprajanatv(cid:2)d itareù(cid:2)m).
169 BDhS 2.11.27, cf. n.168 above. Olivelle, “Renouncer and renunciation,”
pp.88ff.; The (cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, pp.86ff.; Bronkhorst, The Two Sources, pp.33ff.
Gombrich suggests that the parivr(cid:2)jakas the BDhS alludes to are Buddhists, espe-
cially in 2.11.21 and 26, see “The Buddha’s Book of Genesis?”, IIJ, 35 (1992), p.173,
and “The Earliest Brahmanical Reference to Buddhism?” in P. Bilimoria and J. N.

170 The text is somewhat confusing here, since the argument of the p(cid:6)rvapakùa is
interrupted by the uttarapakùa with a statement that seems to belong at 2.11.29; see
Olivelle, Dharmas(cid:6)tras, p.387 (for 1.11.29 and 1.11.25 read 2.11.29 and 2.11.25 re-
spectively).

(ad(cid:8)ùñatv(cid:2)t) and, therefore, that this citation must refer to the four dif-
ferent kinds of rites, the vegetal, animal, soma and ghee offerings
(2.11.9-10, 29). This is indicative of the nature of the debate. Since the
perception is that the traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic way of life is being threat-
ened, Baudh(cid:3)yana repeatedly reasserts, through vedic citations, the
importance of knowing the Veda (2.11.31), procreation (31, 33, 34)
and sacrifice (32, 33, 34), all of which constitute the very ideological
foundations of br(cid:3)hmaõic prestige culture.
In both of these texts renunciation falls outside the scope of
dharma. This is not the case however with the (cid:2)DhS and VDhS, both
of which accept the validity of the (cid:2)(cid:3)rama system (as it was then), and
therefore accept those forms of asceticism that could be contained
within its scope. But (cid:2)pastamba still takes a rather defensive position
against ascetics. This is evident, for example, when he rejects the type
of parivr(cid:2)jaka who abandons the Veda, seeks the self ((cid:2)tman) and
attains peace (kùema) when he achieves insight (buddha), because this
is opposed by the scriptures ((cid:3)(cid:2)stras).171 (cid:2)pastamba also asserts the
equality of the (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas against those celibates ((cid:6)rdhvaretas) who ar-
gue that their mode of life is superior, and in so doing he reclaims the
right of ultimate authority for the Veda, and reasserts the necessity to
perform the proper rites and to have children (2.23.3ff.).172 (cid:2)pastamba
seems to reveal a more equivocal position, preferring the householder
but also accepting some form of the (cid:2)(cid:3)rama system (though not all
forms of asceticism) and stating the equality of the (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas.
By the time of Vasiùñha, which is clearly the latest of the dharma-
s(cid:6)tras, much of the heat has gone out of the debate concerning the
validity of the (cid:2)(cid:3)rama system. Indeed, as Olivelle has discussed, it is
in Vasiùñha that the (cid:2)(cid:3)rama system is properly integrated into a
dharmas(cid:6)tra for the first time.173 Yet even in the VDhS there is a cer-
tain defensiveness that leads Vasiùñha to assert the householder’s su-
premacy over the other (cid:2)(cid:3)ramas, a supremacy based in one instance
on the fact that he alone offers sacrifices (8.14-17). Furthermore, in
his description of the parivr(cid:2)jaka, the most severe of the ascetics he
discusses, it is said that he may abandon all ritual activity (sarva-
karm(cid:2)õi), yet must never abandon the Veda (vedam … na sann-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

refers to Buddhists.

yaset).174 This defensiveness is still evident in a later dharma text like
the MS, which also asserts on a number of occasions the superiority of
the householder (3.77-8, 6.87-90), despite the fact that this text ac-
cepts and spends considerable space describing various ascetic life-
styles.175 It is also at this time that the ‘classical’ model of the (cid:2)(cid:3)rama
system is beginning to take form as successive life stages, thereby
ameliorating the challenge of the ascetic modes of life to the house-
holder by assigning the ‘ascetic’ period of a person’s life to what ef-
fectively amounts to retirement in old age.
The tensions between these different ways of pursuing religious
goals took a long time to be worked through, and probably never en-
tirely disappeared. Nor should their gradual synthesis be understood as
a simple linear progression leading to their mutual absorption in which
both were contained in a single world view. Rather, one might imag-
ine a more complex scenario where the issues at stake were continu-
ally revisited and reassessed, and either option was reasserted as su-
perior against the other. The reasons for such historical fluctuation
must of course be equally complex. Undoubtedly political changes
must have played their part; thus, for example, the assumption to rule
of the br(cid:3)hman (cid:6)uïgas after the fall of the Mauryas, who had shown
great sympathy towards the newer movements, saw a resurgence of
the traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic sacrificial tradition.176 Such fluctuation is
also behind, I believe, the various responses to or rationalisations of
the tensions between these two positions found in the Mbh. One such
case is the (cid:6)P episode, discussed below, that forms the background to
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s instruction of Yudhiùñhira (and hence to the (cid:2)DhP); another
may be found in the discussions of prav(cid:8)ttidharma and niv(cid:8)ttidharma
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
174 VDhS 10.4.
175 Manu however does not always present a unified position in respect to ascetics.
In 5.89 he places ‘those who live among ascetics’ (pravrajy(cid:2)su tiùñhat(cid:2)m) on a par
with ‘those who commit suicide’ ((cid:2)tmanas ty(cid:2)gin(cid:2)ü) and ‘those who are born in vain
(impotent?) and from mixed classes’ (v(cid:8)th(cid:2)saükaraj(cid:2)t(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü) as among those for
whom libations (udakakriy(cid:2)) should not be offered.
176 Apparently also related to the formation and final redaction of the vedic texts,
see Witzel, “The Development,” pp.326ff., 331f. However, in “Post-Mauryan States
of Mainland South Asia (c. BC 185-AD 320),” in Allchin, The Archaeology, p.312, D.
K. Chakrabarti notes that there is barely a “reduction of Buddhist structural activities”
in this period. Shailendra Bhandare (“Numismatics and History: The Maurya-Gupta
Interlude in the Gangetic Plain,” in P. Olivelle (ed.), Between the empires: society in
India 300 BCE to 400 CE, New York: OUP, 2006, 67-112) has recently questioned
the existence of a (cid:6)uïga dynasty.
DHARMA 125
found later in the MDhP; and another again in K(cid:7)ùõa’s teachings to
Arjuna in the BhG.177 It may be that these different responses reflect
different historical situations, but it may be also that at any one time
there were various attempts to resolve the same fundamental tensions.
All are different responses addressing similar issues arising from the
tensions first encountered between the ‘man in the world’, who is ex-
emplified in the br(cid:3)hmaõic textual tradition of the dharmas(cid:6)tras by
the paradigm of the g(cid:8)hastha, and the renouncer of the newly emer-
gent ascetic traditions.
The hesitant incorporation of the ascetic, renunciant traditions within
the sphere of dharma in some of the dharmas(cid:6)tras brings into relief
the two developments I am trying to trace here: the rise of dharma as a
word that confers conceptual legitimacy on the one hand, and the ten-
sion between the traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic world view and the new ‘as-
cetic’ movements on the other. These two developments background
Yudhiùñhira’s crisis in the (cid:6)P and, subsequently, the br(cid:3)hmaõic model
of kingship loosely articulated in the (cid:2)DhP. A further source which
clarifies the issues at stake is the inscriptions of the great Mauryan
emperor A(cid:5)oka. This is because his ideology seems heavily influenced
by many of the values most vigorously pursued by these new move-
ments, and also because of the particular ways in which he uses the
word dharma, which is perhaps a key moment in the rise of the con-
cept to a central status within the various Indian intellectual and reli-
gious traditions.
3.3 A(cid:3)oka
It would be difficult to underestimate the importance of A(cid:5)oka and,
perhaps more precisely, his inscriptions, for the history of ancient In-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
177 And, of course, the systemising of varõ(cid:2)(cid:3)ramadharma into a sequential series
of life stages is another attempted resolution to the same problem. It is interesting in
this regard to note that in Olivelle’s view this rapprochement did not come from tradi-
tional br(cid:3)hmans, but rather from the proponents of the new movements who were
seeking legitimacy by being included within the sphere of dharma, see especially The
(cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, pp.94ff.
126 CHAPTER THREE
dia.178 Being the oldest, firmly datable, large body of writing yet found
in the Indian subcontinent, they provide a valuable source for the be-
ginnings of writing, the dialects of middle Indo-Aryan languages, the
history of the Mauryan empire and A(cid:5)oka’s own life.179
Given that one of the many challenges epic studies faces is identi-
fying the historical circumstances out of which the Mbh arose and to
which it responds, it is perhaps not surprising that a number of schol-
ars have attempted to read different aspects of the Mbh against A(cid:5)oka
and his inscriptions.180 There are at least two instances in which Ar-
juna’s crisis in the BhG has been read against the background of
A(cid:5)oka’s edicts, particularly in respect of the latter’s own supposed
crisis after the Kaliïga war.181 Both of these studies, however, have a
tendency to overstate the parallels between the two. Keller rightly per-
ceives that in the BhG it is the “content of the notion of dharma which
is at stake”, yet overstates the case in suggesting that, “Arjuna’s think-
ing betrays the influence of an ethic of non-violence.”182 Rather, what
is striking about the BhG, and this is particularly so in comparison to
Yudhiùñhira’s crisis that we shall explore below, is that Arjuna ex-
presses his conflict over dharma in terms that reflect its understanding
in conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic contexts. Arjuna is not so much worried
about killing in general, but specifically killing his own family mem-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
178 I must thank Patrick Olivelle for some pointed suggestions for this section and,
indeed, for the subject matter of dharma in general. In particular, he generously pro-
vided me with a list of the occurrences of dharma in A(cid:5)oka’s inscriptions.
179 Recent evidence suggests the use of writing in Sri Lanka at least a century be-
fore A(cid:5)oka, see S.U. Deraniyagala, The Prehistory of Sri Lanka, Colombo: Dept. of
Archaeological Survey, Gov. of Sri Lanka, 1992, pp.739-50; R.A. Coningham and
F.R. Allchin, “The Rise of Cities in Sri Lanka,” in Allchin, The Archaeology,
pp.176ff.; for a brief, recent overview in which this new evidence is discussed in the
context of H. Falk’s and O. von Hinuber recent studies, see R. Salomon, Indian Epi-
graphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-
Aryan Languages, New York, Oxford: OUP, 1998, pp.10-14. I exclude, of course, the
Harappan seals, which, it has recently been argued, do not represent writing at all; see
S. Farmer et al., “The Collapse of the Indus-Script Thesis: The Myth of a Literate
Harappan Civilization,” Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies, 11.2 (2004), pp.19-57.

the Buddha and Jina to ahiüs(cid:2).
DHARMA 127
bers, teachers and friends.183 The particularly familial character of his
conflict is brought to bear in the first chapter of the BhG in a passage
repeatedly underlining the conservative nature of his concerns. Fight-
ing, he worries, will lead to the destruction of his family (kula), the
‘eternal family laws’ (kuladharm(cid:2)þ san(cid:2)tan(cid:2)þ) will fall; and with
dharma destroyed adharma will overcome the family, its women will
become corrupted, leading to the intermixture of the classes (varõa-
saükara).184 Varõasaükara is, of course, precisely what the teachings
of the dharma literature are very much concerned with avoiding.
A more promising subject of comparison with A(cid:5)oka would be
Yudhiùñhira, since it is the horror of killing itself and the harsh reali-
ties of kingship which provoke Yudhiùñhira’s peculiar response to his
responsibilities. Yudhiùñhira has indeed been fruitfully compared with
A(cid:5)oka by Sutton and Fitzgerald,185 who have both suggested that the
character of Yudhiùñhira was conceived as a response to A(cid:5)oka. Like
A(cid:5)oka, Yudhiùñhira’s characterisation in the Mbh draws on ideas bor-
rowed from the newer religious movements. For Fitzgerlad, the
Yudhiùñhira of the beginning of the (cid:6)P “in his attempt to renounce the
kingship and go to the forest, was deliberately scripted by the authors
of the epic to represent what they saw to be wrong with the Mauryan
emperor A(cid:5)oka”.186 In the following I will not read Yudhiùñhira against
A(cid:5)oka as directly as Sutton and Fitzgerald. What I shall do is draw
attention to two particular aspects of A(cid:5)oka’s edicts which bear on the
history of the usage of the word dharma in significant ways. The first
is the frequently noted moral temper of the message, which bear some
influence from the various movements of the previous couple of cen-
turies, in particular from Buddhism; and secondly to the particular
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
183 BhG 1.25ff. Cf. M. Biardeau, “The Salvation of the King in the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,”
CIS, 15.1-2 (1981), p.93.
184 See especially 1.37ff. The ‘conservative’ nature of Arjuna’s distress is further
pronounced in his concern for his ancestors, who fall down because their (cid:3)r(cid:2)ddha
rites would be discontinued with the death of those who would perform them (1.42
patanti pitaro hy eù(cid:2)ü luptapiõóodakakriy(cid:2)þ).

Tensions of the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,” Religion, 27 (1997), pp.333-41; Fitzgerald, “The
Mokùa Anthology,” p.151; The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.114-39; “Making Yudhiùñhira

186 “Making Yudhiùñhira,” pp.64-5. Fitzgerald (ibid.) goes on to suggest that it was
“to purge and refute” A(cid:5)oka’s rule that was “the principle (sic) purpose for the crea-
tion of the first generation of our written Sanskrit Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata.”
128 CHAPTER THREE
way in which A(cid:5)oka, as part of his general emphasis on ethics, used
the word dharma (dhaüma), a usage which represents a significant
moment in the word’s history.
The ‘dhaüma’ campaign outlined in A(cid:5)oka’s edicts has received
much scholarly attention.187 In these edicts A(cid:5)oka heralded, with a
considered rhetoric, what he wanted others to believe was a new era.
The edicts portray A(cid:5)oka self-consciously separating himself from his
own previous conduct and from that of his predecessors and, in so do-
ing, they unquestionably adopt a moral tenor to convey the apparent
novelty of A(cid:5)oka’s reign, a novelty emphasised by repeated assertions
that A(cid:5)oka’s descendents should also conduct themselves in the same
manner.188 The word A(cid:5)oka used to describe and legitimise this new
message was, of course, dhaüma (dharma). To begin to delineate his
sense of the term I will cite some examples of these two aspects of
A(cid:5)oka’s rhetoric: his separation of himself from his past, and his de-
lineation of something apparently quite new. It should be emphasised
that the focus here is on A(cid:5)oka’s rhetoric, the relationship of which to
historical realia is another question altogether.189
The most famous example of this kind of tendency in respect to his
own behaviour is found in the thirteenth rock edict, which expresses
his remorse at the terrible destruction wrought during the Kaliïga war,
fought in the ninth year of his reign and projected as a significant turn-
ing point in his life.190 In reflecting upon the suffering he caused,
A(cid:5)oka proposed a new way of conquest, conquest by dhaüma (dhaü-
mavijaya),191 which his descendents should regard as the ‘only kind of
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
187 I have used the additions of E. Hultzsch (Inscriptions of A(cid:3)oka, Varanasi: In-
dological Book House, 1969) and P.K. Andersen (Studies in the Minor Rock Edicts of
A(cid:3)oka, Freiburg: Hedwig Falk, 1990). Textual examples follow, for no particualar
reason, the Girnar edicts. For an overview of the edicts, see now H. Falk’s A(cid:3)okan
Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography, Mainz am Rhein: Verlag
Philipp von Zabern, 2006.
188 Cf. Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.119: “... A(cid:5)oka’s edicts represent a
remarkably aggressive policy of attempting to shape the thinking and behaviour of his
subjects.”
189 Cf. Gregory Alles, The Iliad, the R(cid:3)m(cid:3)yaõa, and the Work of Religion, Penn-

191 Dharmavijaya is also found in (cid:6)P 59 and 96, and KA 12.1.10ff. Though it is
not clear that they are precisely the same idea in each of these occurrences, it is curi-
ous that while many scholars assume the KA dates from the time of Candragupta

conquest’. The instrument of persuasion in this ‘conquest’ was ideol-
ogy rather than force. There are, however, less dramatic, but no less
significant, examples of his desire to distinguish himself from the past.
RE I announces A(cid:5)oka’s intention to reduce and eventually discon-
tinue the killing of animals in his kitchen; RE IV delivers an oppro-
brium on the ‘killing of animals, the hurting of living beings, discour-
tesy to relatives, br(cid:3)hmans and (cid:3)ramaõas’ in times past, and declares
A(cid:5)oka’s intention to promote the opposite through his ‘instruction on
dhaüma’ (dhaüm(cid:2)nusasñi), repeated in similar fashion in the Greek-
Aramaic RE from Kandahar;192 RE V and PE VII announce the estab-
lishment of the post of dhaümamah(cid:2)m(cid:2)ta, an officer appointed to
promulgate A(cid:5)oka’s dhaüma, an innovation apparently based upon
but distinguished from the administrative post of the mah(cid:2)m(cid:2)ta,
which presumably had existed previously;193 similarly PE VII de-
scribes the pillar edicts bearing his message dhaümathaübhas, ‘pil-
lars of dhaüma’, as opposed to sil(cid:2)thaübhas, those pillars not in-
scribed with his message of dhaüma but only relating events, such as
the Rummind(cid:12)(cid:8) and Nigal(cid:8) S(cid:3)gar pillars, or on which his message had
not yet been inscribed, as is said on MRE I;194 RE VI announces his
intention to better expedite administrative affairs, which ‘did not exist
before’ (na bh(cid:6)tapurva), in order to promote the ‘welfare of all the
people’ (sarvalokahita), for which purpose he inscribed the inscription
on dhaüma (dhaümalip(cid:5)); RE VIII announces his intention to replace
the pleasure tours (vih(cid:2)ray(cid:2)t(cid:2)) of the past, in which kings pursued
‘hunting and other such pleasures’, with ‘dhaüma tours’ (dhaüma-
y(cid:2)t(cid:2)); RE IX suggests that the various ceremonies (maügala) people
practice (some of which sound very much like the saüsk(cid:2)ras) bear
little fruit (apaphala), and hence should be replaced with dhaüma-
maügala, consisting primarily of respectful conduct towards others, a
prominent motif of his edicts.
While it is quite probable that we may never finally answer how
much A(cid:5)oka took from Buddhism, it could hardly be doubted the ex-
tent to which he must have been influenced by his being a lay follower
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
Maurya, and therefore use it to reconstruct Mauryan history, few if any then consider
the consequences of it containing a supposedly A(cid:5)okan idea like dharmavijaya.

of it, and by the ethics contained in the Buddhist teachings. The ethi-
cal import of the edicts is everywhere apparent. One could cite, for
example, the repeated injunction to be respectful towards br(cid:3)hmans,
(cid:3)ramaõas, parents, teachers, elders, servants and slaves (e.g. RE III,
IV, V, IX, XI, XIII, MRE II, PE VII); the banning of hunting and fish-
ing, the reduction in the killing of animals for food, his appeal to an
abstention from hurting (avihiüsa) all animals and human beings (e.g.
RE I, III, IV, V, XI, PE II, V, VII); his apparent banning of capital, as
suggested by Norman;195 his religious forbearance (e.g. RE VII,
XII),196 evident especially in the unique PE VII of Delhi-Topra, but
indicated also by his repeated appeal to act respectfully towards br(cid:3)h-
mans and (cid:3)ramaõas (see above), and his donating of caves to the (cid:2)j(cid:8)-
vikas in the Bar(cid:3)bar Hill cave inscriptions. If this emphasis on an ethi-
cal mode of life, which is intimately connected to his understanding of
dhaüma, bears some relationship to the Buddha’s own teachings, it
probably is not correct to say, however, that it was to the Buddha’s
dhamma to which A(cid:5)oka generally referred.197 A(cid:5)oka’s use of the
word, rather, seems to be a ‘secular’ reflection of the many move-
ments which had arisen in the previous couple of centuries, and thus
was designed to appeal beyond the concerns of any specific religious
persuasion, as must have been necessary given the extensive geo-
graphic reach of his inscriptions and the cultural diversity that must
have been found within their compass.198 That A(cid:5)oka was acutely
aware of the context in which he introduced his message of dharma,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
195 “A(cid:5)oka and Capital Punishment,” Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1975,
pp.16-24.
196 On the other hand, A(cid:5)oka’s intolerance towards the killing of animals and, it
seems, the sacrifice of animals (RE 1), certainly would have caused difficulties for the
religious practices of many ‘vedic’ br(cid:3)hmans, who, presumably, still engaged in the
(cid:3)rauta rites. Similarly, as already noted, he disapproved of numerous minor rites in
RE IX. Cf. Alles, The Iliad, pp.65, 172 n.52; Fitzgerald, “Making Yudhiùñhira,” pp.78,
81-3; Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.120-1. Falk has recently suggested (A(cid:3)okan Sites,
pp.55-7) that the geographical sites of MRE I, an edict containing an appeal to the
merit of Buddhist practice, were strategically located to reach large crowds during
(non-Buddhist) religious festivals.
197 Only rarely does it refer to the Buddha’s dhamma, as in the so called Bair(cid:3)ñ-
Calcutta edict (the edict comes from near Bair(cid:3)ñ in Rajasthan but is now housed at the
Asiatic Society in Calcutta).
198 Thus Thapar, A(cid:3)oka, p.309: “His ideas on dhamma borrow from the current
debate but are set within an imperial framework. … Dhamma as he defines it, was an
ethical principle with an appeal to the broadest social spectrum.” Cf. Hacker,
“Dharma im Hinduismus,” pp.93f. In private correspondence, Patrick Olivelle sug-
gested that A(cid:5)oka used dharma like “ ‘family values’ is used in American politics”.
DHARMA 131
in which the very idea itself was being contested, seems to be indi-
cated in PE II in which he asks, ‘Dharma is good, but of what does
dhaüma consist?’199
This brings us to the specific way that the word dhaüma is used in
A(cid:5)oka’s edicts. To someone well versed in the way dharma occurs in
traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic texts like the dharmas(cid:6)tras and -(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, and
even in the epics, the edicts of A(cid:5)oka represent a remarkable contrast.
The dharma texts frequently qualify the meaning of dharma by apply-
ing it to a particular group within society, whether this be ‘horizon-
tally’ according to region or family (e.g. de(cid:3)a- or kuladharma) or ‘ver-
tically’ according to social class or function (e.g. varõadharma, j(cid:2)ti-
dharma, (cid:2)(cid:3)ramadharma, r(cid:2)jadharma, svadharma, etc.). Accordingly,
it is often found as the last member of a compound. When in these
texts a particular attribute of dharma is meant to apply to everyone,
this must be specified, as it quite often is. In the A(cid:5)okan edicts, how-
ever, dharma is never qualified in this way at all. Rather, while it is
obviously qualified according to the kinds of behaviour considered
‘dharmic’, these are portrayed as generally binding; what is con-
sidered ‘proper conduct’ is never restricted by regional or social cate-
gories. This lack of specificity is reflected in the actual use of the
word, for it is quite remarkable that of all the occurrences of dhaüma
in A(cid:5)oka’s edicts there is only one occasion in which it is the last
member of a compound, and in this instance, from the Calcutta-Bair(cid:3)ñ
edict, it refers to the Buddha’s teaching as saddhaüma, the true
dharma, an obviously different case. On the other hand, there is a
striking proliferation in A(cid:5)oka’s edicts of compounds with dhaüma as
their first member; rather than it being qualified, therefore, it is in fact
the qualifier.200 Certain activities, people or events are considered to
be dharmic, and by this it is meant that they are ‘generally good’ in a
sense with clear moral implications. For A(cid:5)oka dharma points towards
a universal ethic that everyone must always strive towards; proper
conduct in this understanding is proper conduct for all.

132 CHAPTER THREE
In the next chapter, we shall see how Yudhiùñhira articulates his own
conflict over dharma, a conflict that revolves around the two broad
traditions we have explored in this chapter: the ‘conservative’ br(cid:3)h-
maõic conception of dharma, and the various challenges to this con-
ception from non-br(cid:3)hmaõic circles. The tension between these two
traditions more and more came to be expressed through a debate over
dharma itself, as the concept of dharma was becoming central to all
debates concerning what constituted proper conduct. Consequently, to
legitimise any kind of conduct it was necessary to demonstrate that
that conduct was dharmic.
One of the starting points of this chapter was to provide some
grounds for explaining the coining of the term (cid:2)paddharma, and for
the collection of texts in the (cid:2)DhP. We can now see that the shift of
dharma to the centre of br(cid:3)hmaõic self-expression, a shift that began
with the dharmas(cid:6)tras, and gathered pace thereafter, was decisive for
both these issues. While, on the one hand, the compound (cid:2)paddharma
reflects a growing tendency to use the word dharma to indicate the
legitimacy of the ideas it appends to,201 on the other hand, the collect-
ing of texts into the (cid:2)DhP partly reflects a concern to seek legitimacy
for the contents of these texts in terms of dharma—particularly in re-
gard to those expressing political contingencies. The need to legiti-
mise political conduct in terms of dharma is especially felt in the con-
text of Yudhiùñhira’s distress at the outcome of the war in the opening
chapters of the (cid:6)P, an episode that represents both the narrative and
discursive context of the (cid:2)DhP. While Yudhiùñhira’s crisis and confu-
sion over dharma provides a narrative reason for the introduction of
the type of instructions the texts of the (cid:2)DhP relate, the deliverance of
these texts by the divinely sanctioned Bh(cid:8)ùma to the heroic king
Yudhiùñhira—who bridges the divide between a legendary past and a
present represented by his descendent Janamejaya, a divide marked by
the great war of the Mbh—gives the texts of the (cid:2)DhP their authority
as sm(cid:8)ti.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
201 Note, by way of contrast, the use of the compound (cid:2)patkalpa in the GDhS (see
above pp.40f.), which shows that the coining of (cid:2)paddharma in (probably) the MS
and Mbh to refer to the same set of rules was the result of an expansion in the usage
and applicability of dharma and the ‘superceding’ of older collective terms for rules,
such as ‘kalpa’.
(cid:3)
CHAPTER FOUR
YUDHIúòHIRA AND THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE
(cid:4)PADDHARMAPARVAN
The previous chapter traced the development of a conservative, br(cid:3)h-
maõic conception of dharma from its inception to its crystallisation in
the dharmas(cid:6)tras, and the antithesis of such a conception in non-
br(cid:3)hmaõic traditions. This chapter will now explore how these two
conceptions were debated in the Mbh and, especially, their internalisa-
tion in the character of Yudhiùñhira.1 Both the diversity and ambiva-
lence of the Mbh’s presentations on dharma, and Yudhiùñhira’s own
prominent position in these presentations, are well acknowledged in
studies of the Mbh.2 Yudhiùñhira is uniquely suited as the conduit
through which to explore issues pertaining to dharma, since he bears a
special relationship to the concept through his divine father, Dharma,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1 Cf. Fitzgerald, “Making Yudhiùñhira,” and The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.79-142,
who refers to ‘older’ and the ‘newer’ conceptions of dharma. A useful summary of
dharma in the Mbh is found in N. Sutton, Religious Doctrines in the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,
Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2000, pp.318ff., though I have certain reservations about
his use of the terms ‘morality’ and ‘ethics’, as, for example, when he divides ‘ritual
ethics’ from ‘moral ethics’. By ‘ritual ethics’ Sutton seems to be speaking about what
I am calling the ‘conservative’ notion of dharma, and he contrasts this with
Yudhiùñhira’s ‘moral ethics’. But I would hesitate before designating these differences
in this way. There seems to be no reason to believe that following one’s svadharma
did not imply a moral decision, in which priority was given to a specific social order;
in fact, in almost all (classical, i.e. post-vedic) uses of the word dharma, morality,
ethics, and virtue always seem to be implicated. The very fact that the debate centres
on different applications of the same word should point to the conclusion that the
debate is about ‘what constitutes ethical or moral behaviour?’ not about a choice be-
tween a way of acting that is conclusively moral or immoral (or amoral). Even in Eng-
lish the words ‘morality’ and ‘ethics’ so often seem implicated in each other. To my
mind Sutton’s use of the terms decides the issue for us, whereas what is the most
moral way of living is exactly the question that has to be resolved.

134 CHAPTER FOUR
and his status as the dharma king, the dharmar(cid:2)ja. This chapter offers
an exposition of the opening chapters of the (cid:6)P, the post-war scene in
which Yudhiùñhira expresses his profound regret at the outcome of the
war, and his consequent desire to renounce the kingdom and adopt the
violence-free life of an ascetic. This episode is important for our un-
derstanding of the (cid:2)DhP because it provides its narrative frame and,
in doing so, articulates the ideological context out of which the (cid:2)DhP
arises. Yudhiùñhira’s grief ((cid:3)oka) and his resolve to renounce provide
the narrative context in which the great teachings of the subsequent
didactic corpora take place. It necessitates that Yudhiùñhira be taught
about all aspects of ruling and dharma, how they relate to each other,
and, indeed, that ruling is dharma.
Before beginning, it will be useful to briefly summarise the find-
ings of the previous chapter. The first of the two senses of dharma
brought into focus by Yudhiùñhira’s crisis is indebted to what might be
called a ‘conservative’ tradition of dharma, a tradition espoused by
br(cid:3)hmans especially in the dharma-s(cid:6)tras and -(cid:3)(cid:2)stras. In this usage
dharma refers to the particular duties of each class (varõa), sometimes
referring to the entirety of these duties, sometimes to a particular sub-
set of them (for example, in any context, dharma may refer to just
kùatriyadharma, or any of the other varõadharmas, etc.); fundamen-
tally, it is an internally differentiated set of rules that maintains order
within (cid:2)rya society, forming the essential identity of each individual
member of that society, and is centred upon the sacrificing house-
holder (g(cid:8)hastha).3 It should be noted, however, that while I call this
idea of dharma ‘conservative’, the early dharmas(cid:6)tras, in which, at
least in the br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition, dharma was explored in any great
detail for the first time, are in a significant way a ‘new’ development.
Br(cid:3)hmaõic literatures prior to the dharmas(cid:6)tras show neither a great
concern to explore dharma, nor give dharma a central place in their
terminology.
The second use of the term, which frequently stands as the antithe-
sis to what is required by this ‘conservative’ tradition, emphasises the
absolute merit of particular kinds of behaviour that preclude, paradig-
matically in respect to kùatriyadharma and r(cid:2)jadharma, the possibility
of some elements of varõadharma. Arguments about what constitutes
proper behaviour begin to exhibit a certain dissatisfaction with the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
3 Halbfass, India and Europe, pp.320-21.
THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE (cid:2)PADDHARMAPARVAN 135
conduct warriors and kings must undertake in order to fulfil their
dharma, such as, of course, violence. Hence they often highlight par-
ticular attitudes, such as (cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)amsya (gentleness, absence of cruelty)
and ahiüs(cid:2) (non-killing). Sometimes, notably in the Mbh, these take
on characteristics that imply a universal ethic, in complete distinction
from the ‘conservative’ tradition.
4.1 The Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata, dharma, Yudhiùñhira
The (cid:6)P beings with Yudhiùñhira in a state of great agitation. Most of
the warriors from the great war are dead and the Kauravas are van-
quished. But the cost of victory has been great, and the continuance of
the lineage has only just been salvaged from the aftermath of A(cid:5)va-
tth(cid:3)man’s wrath. Yudhiùñhira is on the banks of the Bh(cid:3)g(cid:8)rath(cid:8) with
the survivors from the war, performing the obsequies for the dead
warriors and preparing to remain there for a month in order to be puri-
fied, his ‘mind entirely confounded with grief’ ((cid:3)okavy(cid:2)kulacetana).4
The sage N(cid:3)rada approaches and says to Yudhiùñhira, ‘you’ve won
this whole earth righteously’,5 ‘intent upon the duties of a warrior, do
you rejoice, P(cid:3)õóava? … Now that you’ve obtained this prosperity, I
hope that grief doesn’t torment you.’6 This passage juxtaposes two
points that on the face of it may seem in conflict. The first is N(cid:3)rada’s
description of Yudhiùñhira’s winning of the earth as an act performed
righteously, dharmeõa; that is, the acts which caused the destruction
of his kin accorded with dharma, and hence were just and lawful. The
second is the emphasis he places on Yudhiùñhira’s kùatriya status and
the fulfillment of his royal obligations: Yudhiùñhira, who has won the
earth, is ‘devoted to his warrior duties’ and thereby he wins ‘prosper-
ity’ ((cid:3)r(cid:5)), the royal resonance of which further emphasises the obliga-
tory nature of his actions. With Yudhiùñhira’s duty now performed and
his goal properly gained, N(cid:3)rada ‘hopes’ that Yudhiùñhira rejoices in
his accomplishment. This juxtaposition of conduct necessarily involv-
ing violence (and, as we know from the events of the war, duplicitous

behaviour) with dharma is deliberately provocative and ironic.7 How
is it, indeed, that such a grand slaughter could in any way be regarded
as ‘righteous’? And what, precisely, has Yudhiùñhira won? N(cid:3)rada’s
juxtaposition of ‘rightesousness’ and ‘warrior dharma’ is groundwork
for the arguments that follow, and provokes Yudhiùñhira to seek an-
swers to his royal conundrum. For it is exactly this issue, the relation-
ship of royal and kùatriya duties to morality, to a notion of ‘goodness’,
and the questioning of what exactly is dharma, and hence of the whole
conservative foundation of the ‘system’ of dharmas, that will consume
Yudhiùñhira in the following sections, as it has elsewhere in the epic.
Even though he has subjugated the whole earth, Yudhiùñhira is far
from happy: ‘A heavy grief dwells in my heart’ (me mahad duþkhaü
vartate h(cid:8)di) for ‘through covetousness [I] have brought on this hor-
rific destruction of [my] relatives’ (k(cid:8)tv(cid:2) j(cid:9)(cid:2)tikùayam imaü mah(cid:2)ntaü
lobhak(cid:2)ritam). He is so pained that victory appears to him ‘like de-
feat’ (ajay(cid:2)k(cid:2)ro).8 Feeling great shame at the consequences of his ac-
tions, it is of no comfort to Yudhiùñhira that these actions rescued the
earth from the corrupt disorder of Kaurava rule, or that, by the reckon-
ing of some, his victory was brought about in accordance with dharma
and that he was merely following his own proper behaviour, kùatriya-
dharma.
There is yet a further reason for Yudhiùñhira’s grief. His mother
Kunt(cid:8) has kept a secret from him: the identity of his brother Karõa,
who numbers among the dead.9 Yudhiùñhira now mourns his brother,
listing his great qualities in a passage that reads like a pra(cid:3)aüs(cid:2), in-
tensifying the sense of regret and loss. Though Karõa died at Arjuna’s
hands, Yudhiùñhira was implicated in his death through his recruiting
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
7 With thanks for Alf Hiltebeitel for pointing out some limitations to my earlier
analysis of this section; see also Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, p.66. Cf.
Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.678-9, noting that N(cid:3)rada’s words are remi-
niscent of those he spoke to Yudhiùñhira at Mbh 2.5.7ff.
8 (cid:6)P 1.14-15.
9 Kunt(cid:8) apprises her sons of Karõa’s true identity at Mbh 11.27.6ff. All of Kunt(cid:8)’s
sons were born through the agency of a boon Kunt(cid:8) had acquired which permitted her
to call upon a god at anytime to father sons upon her. Before she is wed, however,
Kunt(cid:8) is overcome with curiosity and, unable resist testing out the boon, summons the
sun-god S(cid:4)rya. Karõa is the result. But, not being married, Kunt(cid:8) secrets him away,
and he is brought up as a low-caste s(cid:6)ta. For an overview of Karna’s life, see the in-
troduction to A. Bowles, Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata. Book 8, Karna (Karõaparvan), Volume 1,

THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE (cid:2)PADDHARMAPARVAN 137
of (cid:6)alya to destroy Karna’s ‘fiery energy’ (tejas), thereby rendering
him easier to kill. Guilt now recoils on Yudhiùñhira and he blames
himself: ‘Ignorant [of his true identity], coveting rule, I caused him to
be killed in battle; this burns my limbs, like fire a pile of cotton.’10 He
relates a précis of the episode in which Kunt(cid:8) revealed to Karõa his
identity and tried, unsuccessfully, to turn him to the P(cid:3)õóavas cause.11
Significantly, Karõa’s loyalty to Duryodhana is taken as indication of
his honourable qualities, for it would have been ‘ignoble, cruel, and
ungrateful’12 to side with the P(cid:3)õóavas, and people would have said
Karõa feared Arjuna (1.29). The emphasis on Karõa’s good qualities
reinforces Yudhiùñhira’s problems with the outcomes of his apparently
dharmic behaviour. His regret and grief, accentuating the tragic loss
and waste that inevitably accompanies war, is underscored with pow-
erful language in which the imagery of fire is prominent:13
tena me d(cid:6)yate ’t(cid:5)va h(cid:8)dayaü bhr(cid:2)t(cid:8)gh(cid:2)tinaþ |
karõ(cid:2)rjunasah(cid:2)yo ’haü jayeyam api v(cid:2)savam||
Because of this [understanding that Karõa was his brother], my heart
fiercely burns, for I murdered my brother. Partnered by Karõa and Ar-
juna, I could even have conquered V(cid:3)sava [Indra].14
And so he asks N(cid:3)rada how all this came to be.
In attempting to relieve Yudhiùñhira of his guilt and distress,
N(cid:3)rada narrates to Yudhiùñhira various deeds from Karõa’s life (chs 2-
5), a life that is at once brilliant and tragic and which he summarises
in the final (cid:3)lokas of chapter five (11-14):

Because of the curse of the br(cid:3)hman and of the great R(cid:3)ma, due to the
boon granted to Kunt(cid:8) and the magic of Indra, due to Bh(cid:8)ùma’s con-
tempt in calling him half a warrior in sum and due to (cid:6)alya destroying
his fiery energy and due to the counsel of K(cid:7)ùõa, Karõa Vaikartana, the
equal of the sun in radiance, was killed in battle by the wielder of
G(cid:3)õó(cid:8)va who had obtained the divine weapons of Rudra, the king of the
gods (Indra), Yama, Varuõa, Kubera, Droõa and the great K(cid:7)pa. In this
way, your brother was cursed and deceived by many. This tiger among
men need not be mourned, for he met his death in battle.
This attempt fails, however. Yudhiùñhira’s pain is not relieved; rather,
quite the reverse is the case. The following quite short chapter de-
scribes a scene overwhelmed with grief. The ironic implications of
Yudhiùñhira’s crisis is suggested again in the opening stanza, which
describes the ‘divine sage’ (devarùir) N(cid:3)rada ‘falling silent’ while the
‘royal sage’ (r(cid:2)jarùi) Yudhiùñhira is ‘immersed in grief’ (cid:3)okapari-
plutaþ. As a divine sage N(cid:3)rada presumably has a profound under-
standing of the compromises and consequences involved in the acqui-
sition and maintenance of royal power, and how these relate to
broader moral questions; but Yudhiùñhira, though a ‘royal sage’, can-
not forgo the very human dimension of the war and the destruction
that his royal commands have brought about. It begs the question, in
what sense is Yudhiùñhira sagely in royal affairs?
Seeing ‘the hero depressed, bowed down, pained, his breathing like
a snake’s, and his eyes shedding tears’,15 Kunt(cid:8), herself distressed, her
‘body seized by grief’ ((cid:3)okapar(cid:5)t(cid:2)ïg(cid:5)) and her ‘mind distraught with
sadness’ (duþkhopahatacetan(cid:2)), approached Yudhiùñhira to appease
his sorrow. ‘You should not grieve for him’ (nainam (cid:3)ocitum arhasi),
and then with more insistence, ‘destroy this sorrow’ (jahi (cid:3)okam).16
Kunt(cid:8) relates her and S(cid:4)rya’s attempts to apprise Karõa of his identity
and unite him with his brothers, thereby offering mitigating (divine)
circumstances that might lift the heavy weight of blame with which
Yudhiùñhira burdens himself; but, ‘seized by time’ (k(cid:2)lapar(cid:5)ta), Karõa
resolved to stay with the Kauravas. This effort to soothe Yudhiùñhira

also fails, and his grief becomes yet further intensified, his eyes filling
with tears and his mind becoming ‘confounded with grief’ (vy(cid:2)kula-
cetanaþ).17 With his grief reaching greater intensity, the epic authors
emphasise Yudhiùñhira’s close relationship to dharma, calling him
dharmar(cid:2)ja, the dharma king, and dharm(cid:2)tm(cid:2), the soul of dharma,
once again rhetorically foregrounding the contrast between Yudhi-
ùñhira’s own perception of dharmic behaviour and the events which
precipitated his success in the war. The chapter continues in much the
same vein. Finally, in the concluding verses of the chapter, Yudhi-
ùñhira’s anguish, brought to a crescendo, is generalised to apply to all
those lost in the war, reminding us that his remorse over Karõa’s death
is emblematic of his distress at the whole disaster and, in particular,
his own role in it (6.11-12):18

Remembering his sons, grandsons, relatives and friends, the king’s
heart shuddered, his mind sick. Hs body overtaken by grief like fire en-
veloped in smoke and oppressed by burning distress, that reflective king
then became utterly despondent.
The phrase nirvedam akarod, translated above as ‘became utterly de-
spondent’, can also be taken to mean ‘became indifferent’, a sense
suggestive of Yudhiùñhira’s frequent response to what he regards as
repugnant royal responsibilities. This is brought to bear in the very
next chapter, which begins with two (cid:3)lokas that again underscore his
debilitation. His ‘mind confounded with grief’ ((cid:3)okavy(cid:2)kulacetana),
‘burning with sadness’ (duþkhasaütaptaþ) he grieved ((cid:3)u(cid:3)oca) for
Karõa, then, ‘engrossed in his sadness and grief’ ((cid:2)viùño duþkha-
(cid:3)ok(cid:2)bhy(cid:2)ü), ‘wan with grief’ ((cid:3)okakar(cid:3)ita), he laments to Arjuna

If we had been mendicants in the city of the V(cid:7)ùõis and Andhakas, we
would not have suffered this misfortune, depriving our relatives of men.
The plans of our enemies have succeeded; indeed the Kurus have lost
their purpose! Having killed ourselves by ourselves, what fruit of lawful
conduct (dharma) have we obtained? Damn warrior behaviour; damn
the power that is produced from the chest; damn passion; by these we
attained this misfortune. Goodness, equanimity, self-restraint, purity,
absence of enmity, absence of passion, non-violence, truthful speech,
these always exist in those who live in the forest. But, greedy and ob-
sessive, clinging to arrogance and pride, we have fallen into this situa-
tion due to our desire for a mere kingdom.
The full force of Yudhiùñhira’s conflict is brought to bear in this pas-
sage. The conditional mood is perfectly suitable to Yudhiùñhira’s char-
acter, trapped as he is somewhere between who he is and who he
wants to be. Victory is again given the guise of defeat; though they lie
dead, his enemies have really won. Kùatriya behaviour, which brought
about the events of the war and the destruction of Yudhiùñhira’s rela-
tives, is juxtaposed to the behaviour of ‘forest-dwellers’, mendicants
who appear to remain above political compromises. While strongly
condemning warrior behaviour and questioning the fruits of kùatriya-
dharma, Yudhiùñhira valorises its direct opposite, non-violence, equa-
nimity and so forth. And he doubts the worthiness of his and his allies’
motivation: the quest for the kingdom was driven by ego, not piety.
Clearly he is expressing significant dissent in regard to conservative
br(cid:3)hmaõic conceptions of dharmic order.
Yudhiùñhira also makes a telling inversion: the situation in which
they now find themselves is (cid:2)pad, a situation of calamity. This is em-
phasised in the last of the quoted verses when Yudhiùñhira uses the
word (cid:2)panna, a cognate form of (cid:2)pad, which frequently means simply
‘obtained,’ but etymologically derives from the idea of ‘falling down’,
underlining that he considers their current situation a decline. As al-
ready seen, a time of (cid:2)pad typically refers to a situation in which nor-
mal codes of behaviour do not apply because environmental or social
conditions inhibit their performance. The Bh(cid:3)rata war itself may prop-
erly be considered a time of distress, where abnormal codes of con-
duct may apply in order to reassert the normative order; and, of
course, the Mbh is famous for the seemingly abnormal behaviour of
THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE (cid:2)PADDHARMAPARVAN 141
its heroes in numerous situations in the war, paradigmatically in the
deaths of the Kaurava generals.19 But Yudhiùñhira calls their current
situation a time of (cid:2)pad. Feasibly this could refer to the ‘menless’
state in which they now find themselves, suggesting the continuation
of the various lineages is threatened; or it could also refer to the whole
loss incurred in the war and its emotional toll. Yet this does not seem
to be the intent of the passage, not least because of the clearly opposite
position taken by the other characters, as for example by N(cid:3)rada, as
we have seen, but more significantly by other surviving protagonists
of the war, led above all by Yudhiùñhira’s brothers and Draupad(cid:8).20
So great is Yudhiùñhira’s disgust that he sees no recompense at all,
not even sovereignty over the triple world (7.8); the dead should not
have been abandoned (na … ty(cid:2)jya) for anything (7.11). Yudhiùñhira
continues his remorseful speech for the remainder of chapter seven,
regretting the unrealised promise of the fallen warriors’ youth and
blaming Duryodhana for the whole mess, though still admitting his
own sinful hand in what took place. He tells Arjuna ‘good conduct
destroys evil’,21 and quotes anonymous (cid:3)ruti resonating with upaniùa-
dic sensibilities, to the effect that someone who has renounced (ty(cid:2)ga-
vat) cannot perform evil again, avoids birth and death and attains
brahman. He therefore resolves to go to the forest himself, for accord-
ing to (cid:3)ruti ‘a person attached to possessions is incapable of finding
the most complete law (dharma)’.22 And so Yudhiùñhira makes his
claim for a lifestyle properly beyond him, in which the chief values
are in direct opposition to those obligated to him as kùatriya and, es-
pecially, as king.
This begins a long debate primarily between Yudhiùñhira on the one
hand and his brothers and Draupad(cid:8) on the other, where the latter at-
tempt to convince him to fulfil his duty as ruler of his kingdom.
Though I shall not present a complete account of this dispute, which

20 In particular note the statements of Bh(cid:8)ma in 10.17 and Draupad(cid:8) in 14.36, in
which they take exactly the opposite tack to Yudhiùñhira, and perhaps are responding
precisely to these statements of Yudhiùñhira: he can only renounce in a time of (cid:2)pad
and this is not such a time (Bh(cid:8)ma); and if he renounces he will bring (cid:2)pad down on
himself (Draupad(cid:8)). On these passages see below p.144.

has an interesting parallel in (cid:2)DhP 161,23 it is worth highlighting
some of its more revealing statements. Throughout it is clear that it is
dharma that is in question: what constitutes dharma, what is a per-
son’s proper dharma and what is the highest dharma. We have already
seen what Yudhiùñhira regards as the highest dharma. This is imme-
diately countered by Arjuna. In stark contrast to Yudhiùñhira’s bleak
emotional state, Arjuna is alert and excited, ‘showing himself to be
passionate’ and ‘bold in his outrage’ (dar(cid:3)ayann … (cid:2)tm(cid:2)nam ugram
ugrapar(cid:2)kramaþ), even smiling as he speaks (8.1-2). For Arjuna,
Yudhiùñhira’s reaction is bewildering (8.3):
(cid:3)atr(cid:6)n hatv(cid:2) mah(cid:5)ü labdhv(cid:2) svadharmeõopap(cid:2)dit(cid:2)m|

Having killed your enemies and recovered the earth through your own
proper duty, why, with your enemies dead, would you impulsively
abandon everything?
Arjuna argues that Yudhiùñhira’s proper duty, dharma, the proper duty
of kings, is to rule the kingdom, to enjoy prosperity and to create a
world in which law (dharma) can flourish. He turns Yudhiùñhira’s
grief on its head, for without enjoying the fruits of victory, he asks,
‘for what reason did you kill those princes?’24 He emphasises the mer-
its of wealth (dhana, artha),25 upon which dharma depends and which,
of course, Yudhiùñhira intends to give up if he renounces. Unlike his
elder brother, Arjuna considers the less salubrious aspects of kingship
to be a necessary corollary of keeping order, arguing ‘we don’t see
anywhere any wealth that wasn’t forcibly taken’,26 and, underlining
that the actions he endorses are considered dharma, ‘for the royal
sages who have won heaven call this their dharma’.27 Later, in a simi-
lar vein, he makes significant statements on the issue of ahiüs(cid:2) itself,

25 8.9ff., especially 17 and 21. Cf. also 15.48. Artha here should be taken also in
the sense of king’s proper political conduct which creates the conditions in which
dharma can flourish. Arjuna particularly represents artha, as we will see again in
(cid:2)DhP 161. Cf. Dumézil, Mythe et Epopée I, pp.95f.; M. Biardeau, Études—bhakti et
avat(cid:2)ra, pp.52-60; Biardeau, “The Salvation,” pp.95f.

Dharma was promulgated here for the purpose of the maintenance of
the world. The best conception of dharma is an absence of violence and
good violence. No one is absolutely full of merit or absolutely devoid of
merit. Both good and bad are evident in all activities.
This argument, which is quite typical of those offered to Yudhiùñhira,
attempts to provide a more socially and politically contingent under-
standing of what is ‘good’, what is ‘the right thing to do’. Arjuna does
not countenance any moral absolutes, ‘meritorious behaviour’ is de-
pendent upon a broader sprectrum of outcomes, and upon the particu-
lar role the social system bequeaths to the individual in respect of
those outcomes. There is, therefore, such a thing as ‘good’ violence if
the welfare of the entire world depends upon it. With this apparently
persuasive argument, Arjuna insists Yudhiùñhira should perform an
a(cid:3)vamedha and assume his rightful place as king.
In this exchange Yudhiùñhira and Arjuna have quite different con-
ceptions of what ‘rightful conduct’ (dharma) constitutes, though both
are quite convinced that their respective descriptions are morally
sound and involve conduct that would earn the performer merit.29 The
dispute is left unresolved and Yudhiùñhira does not sway from his in-
tention to renounce.30 The other protagonists take up where Arjuna left
off. Bh(cid:8)ma too points out to Yudhiùñhira that the whole destructive

30 In fact, he discusses two different modes of renunciation: in the first (9.5) he
would still perform the basic rites, ‘offering oblations into the fire and bathing at both
times (morning and evening)’ (juhv(cid:2)no ’gniü yath(cid:2)k(cid:2)lam ubhau k(cid:2)l(cid:2)v upasp(cid:8)(cid:3)an). In
the second (9.12ff.), he would ‘undertake begging as a shaven-headed ascetic’ (caran
bhaikùyaü munir muõóaþ) seeking equanimity in respect to all things (9.14, 20), ‘do-
ing no harm to the four kinds of animate and inanimate beings’ (9.16ab: jaïgam(cid:2)jaï-
gam(cid:2)n sarv(cid:2)n avihiüsaü(cid:3) caturvidh(cid:2)n), abandoning everything. See Bronkhorst, The

episode would be pointless if he renounces the kingdom (10.2), criti-
cising Yudhiùñhira’s values (10.3):
kùam(cid:2)nukamp(cid:2) k(cid:2)ruõyam (cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsyaü na vidyate|
kù(cid:2)tram (cid:2)carato m(cid:2)rgam api bandhos tvadantare||
Patience, sympathy, compassion and an absence of cruelty—these are
not for one pursuing the kùatriya path; yet they are inherent in you,
though you are bound [to this path].
These are precisely the values frequently associated with Yudhiùñhira
throughout the Mbh, sometimes in praise, and sometimes as criticism.
They are often associated with br(cid:3)hmans, and indeed the association
of these values with br(cid:3)hmans and Yudhiùñhira at the same time is also
sometimes made.31 Such associations highlight the impropriety of
Yudhiùñhira’s intentions according to a notion of dharma in which
each social class has its own prescribed behaviour, that is, what I am
calling the ‘conservative’ idea of dharma. Bh(cid:8)ma continues to justify
both the consistency of the P(cid:3)õóavas’ actions with kùatriya duties and
the futility of having performed them without enjoying their fruits. It
is here that he gives a response to Yudhiùñhira’s earlier description of
their situation as one of (cid:2)pad:32 renunciation (saüny(cid:2)sa) for a king is
only for a ‘time of distress’ ((cid:2)patkale), when he is in his old age, or he
has been cheated by his enemies, and the wise do not approve such a
case ‘here’ (iha). Rather, those with ‘subtle intellect’ (s(cid:6)kùmadar(cid:3)in)
consider it a ‘transgression of law (dharma)’ (dharmavyatikrama).33
This emphasises that it is the very idea of dharma which is at stake,
since what is the ‘highest dharma’ for one person, is a ‘transgression
of dharma’ for the other. Later Draupad(cid:8) will articulate a similar posi-
tion when she too points out his confusion of the situation, for rather
than it being calamitous, and hence inviting renunciation, his vow to
renounce invites calamity, for ‘having won the whole earth, you bring
disaster upon yourself’.34
Subsequently, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Draupad(cid:8) extol in a
similar fashion the merits of worldly action (karman), the life of the
householder (g(cid:8)hastha) and the duties of a king. There is a tendency in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
31 E.g. Mbh 3.36.18-19. Cf. Biardeau, “The Salvation,” pp.79, 89f., and in the lat-
ter: “His brahmanhood is more that of a sanny(cid:3)sin than of a householder.”

THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE (cid:2)PADDHARMAPARVAN 145
these arguments to portray the renouncer in as negative a light as pos-
sible, contrasted always with the householder’s mode of life, which is
valorised above all others in a manner reminiscent of the early
dharmas(cid:6)tras.35 In particular, the ascetic is frequently associated with
figures like the n(cid:2)stika, the ‘nay-sayer’ who denies the validity of the
Veda.36 In fact, it is unclear whether Yudhiùñhira would indeed be-
come quite so extreme as to deny the validity of the Veda, though
such an extreme position may be implied in the second kind of asceti-
cism he discusses in 9.12ff. (see above). One suspects, however, that
the epic poets used every opportunity to broaden the terms of the de-
bate.37 Such hyperbole, though quite probably founded in very real
issues and debates, has its rhetorical function as well. In attempting to
convince Yudhiùñhira of the merit of the life of action, involving his
proper kingly duties of protection and sacrifice, his ascetic preferences
are tainted with the worst kind of ascetics, those who, not participating
in the sacrificial order, deny the validity of the Veda.
Yudhiùñhira, however, always returns the debate to the fundamental
problem of violence. Even if his argument sometimes takes on a more
sophisticated soteriological character, his appeal to the ascetic mode
of life seems primarily an appeal to a life without violent behaviour,
the morality of which he struggles to justify in the absolute terms he
seeks. Yudhiùñhira’s argument for ascetic values and against the life of
warriors, and the counter-arguments of his family, should be seen not
simply as a problem located in the existence of asceticism per se, but
also in the universalisation of those values which are especially asso-
ciated with ascetics across the boundaries of varõa. Thus Yudhiùñhira
speaks of the highest dharma, whilst the other protagonists speak of
the highest dharma of kings or kùatriyas; and, when criticised,
Yudhiùñhira is frequently accused of being more like a br(cid:3)hman, as,
for example, in Bh(cid:8)ma’s above statement, or in Draupad(cid:8)’s reprimand,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
35 11-14. See also Olivelle, The (cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, p.153; M. Hara, “A note on the

and above pp.117ff.

37 Cf. P. Olivelle, The (cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, p.22, who speaks of the epic “conflation of
several types of eremitical asceticism into a single institution”. Asceticism as such, of
course, was not outside of the vedic fold, see ibid., pp.8-24; J. Heesterman, The Inner
Conflict, pp.39ff.; above pp.117ff.
146 CHAPTER FOUR
‘friendliness to all beings, generosity, teaching and austerities, ought
to be the dharma of a br(cid:3)hman not of kings’.38 The supreme (para)
dharma of kings, on the other hand, is ‘the restraining of the wicked
and the protection of the good’ (asat(cid:2)ü pratiùedha(cid:3) ca sat(cid:2)ü ca
parip(cid:2)lanam) and ‘not retreating in battle’ (samare … apal(cid:2)yanam)’.39
None of this persuades Yudhiùñhira to desist from his intended
course of action. There is no need to detail the continuation of this
debate which, though it is certainly rich in material, follows in general
outline what has preceded it. Soon the sages Devasth(cid:3)na (20-1) and
Vy(cid:3)sa (23ff.) join in. The problem throughout is still a proper under-
standing of dharma: Yudhiùñhira argues for the notion of a highest
dharma in absolute terms; while the others insist that the only ques-
tion relevant for Yudhiùñhira is what constitutes the highest dharma
for kings, defending a more conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic conception of
dharma that privileges the householder (g(cid:8)hastha) above all others.
Finally, with the intervention of K(cid:7)ùõa in chapter 38, Yudhiùñhira re-
lents and poses a series of questions to Vy(cid:3)sa, questions which again
express his antipathy towards his royal duties and which are a pre-
cursor to the instructions on r(cid:2)jadharma Bh(cid:8)ùma will soon undertake

how, having deceitfully (chalena) brought about Bh(cid:8)ùma’s death, he
could possibly approach him.41 At this point, in a manner that evokes
his roles as avat(cid:2)ra and as expiator of Yudhiùñhira’s sins,42 K(cid:7)ùõa in-
tervenes ‘out of desire for the welfare of the four classes’ (c(cid:2)tur-
varõyahitepsay(cid:2)), telling Yudhiùñhira to give up his grief and ‘do what
is beneficial for the world’ (lokasya … hitaü kuru).43 At last
Yudhiùñhira obliges and, though feeling great pain (mah(cid:2)tap(cid:2)þ), ‘for
the benefit of all the worlds’ (hit(cid:2)rthaü sarvalokasya) casts off his
‘emotional pain and anguish’ (m(cid:2)nasaü duþkhaü saüt(cid:2)paü),44 and
resolves to assume rule of the kingdom. And so with his brothers he
enters H(cid:3)stinapura triumphant.
But the matter of Yudhiùñhira’s equivocation does not end here, as
might be expected. K(cid:7)ùõa asks Bh(cid:8)ùma to speak to the P(cid:3)õóavas and
his allies ‘about the harmony of law and profit’ (dharm(cid:2)rtha-
sam(cid:2)dhi).45 Artha should be understood here in the sense of ‘politics’
as well, all those policies necessary to bring about stability and mate-
rial prosperity in the social world. The question, therefore, is how
could such policy, which may involve activity which has some kind of
immediate negative effect, such as violence and war, be understood in
terms of both some absolute notion of ‘merit’ and the ‘conservative’
system of dharma, both of which seem implicated in the use of the
word dharma here; politics, ‘artha’, is the duty, ‘dharma’, of a king,
and the king must also behave with virtue, dharma. The purpose of

41 Arjuna felled Bh(cid:8)ùma by attacking him from behind (cid:6)ikhaõóin. (cid:6)ikhaõóin had
previously been the woman (cid:6)ikhaõóin(cid:8), and Bh(cid:8)ùma had refused to defend himself
against a man who had previously been a woman ((cid:6)ikhaõóin/(cid:6)ikhaõóin(cid:8) had in his/her
previous life been the princess Amb(cid:3) who had vowed to exact revenge on Bh(cid:8)ùma for
rendering her unmarriagable through a botched attempt to find his brother a wife).
Yudhiùñhira holds Bh(cid:8)ùma to a vow he had made to tell him how he could be killed,
information which is then put to good use. See further Hiltebeitel, The Ritual, pp.239,
244-50.

this instruction is to remove Yudhiùñhira’s anguish because his ‘learn-
ing has become affected by his grief for his relatives’ (tajj(cid:9)(cid:2)ti(cid:3)okopa-
hata(cid:3)ruta),46 presumably because he can no longer see the merit
(dharma) in the duties (dharma) of a king. This is apparent in a num-
ber of passages, such as 38.1-4 quoted above, and when Yudhiùñhira
begins to question Bh(cid:8)ùma at the beginning of the r(cid:2)jadharma instruc-
tions proper (56.2):
r(cid:2)jyaü vai paramo dharma iti dharmavido viduþ|
mah(cid:2)ntam etaü bh(cid:2)raü ca manye tad br(cid:6)hi p(cid:2)rthiva||
The knowers of dharma know that ruling indeed is the highest dharma,
but I think it’s a great burden. Tell me about this, prince.
And later (72.1):
kathaü r(cid:2)j(cid:2) praj(cid:2) rakùan n(cid:2)dhibandhena yujyate|
dharme ca n(cid:2)par(cid:2)dhnoti tan me br(cid:6)hi pit(cid:2)maha||
How does a king protect his people without being filled with anxiety
and doing no wrong to dharma? Explain this to me, grandfather.
And again (98.1):
kùatradharm(cid:2)n na p(cid:2)p(cid:5)y(cid:2)n dharmo ’sti bharatarùabha|
abhiy(cid:2)ne ca yuddhe ca r(cid:2)j(cid:2) hanti mah(cid:2)janam||
There is no more evil dharma than warrior dharma, bull of Bharatas. A
king kills many people when attacking and in battle.47
Passages like this indicate how contested the sense of the word
dharma has become. The epic poets seem to shift imperceptibly be-
tween uses of the word in which, on the one hand, virtue (dharma) is a
product of a specific duty (dharma) within a stratified system of duties
(dharma), one of which is ‘royal duties’ (r(cid:2)jadharma), and, on the
other hand, virtue (dharma) pure and simple. In such a way, the virtue
(dharma) of duty (dharma) comes to be questioned.
To highlight some of the chief motifs of this conflict, we shall ex-
plore a final example. Following Bh(cid:8)ùma’s warning against being a
king who indulges his own desires (k(cid:2)m(cid:2)tman), is malicious ((cid:3)añha-
buddhi), cruel (n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsa) and excessively avaricious (atilubdha), is a
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
46 51.18a.
47 Contrast this with Yudhiùñhira’s more bullish pre-war attitude in Mbh 5.70ff.
Yudhiùñhira again expresses a desire to renounce in MDhP 270.1-5; cf. Fitzgerald,
“The Mokùa Anthology,” p.294 n.1.

Yudhiùñhira said:
I don’t seek the pleasures of ruling, I don’t want to rule even for a
second! On account of the law (dharma) I consented to ruling, but
there’s no law (dharma) in it! Therefore I’ve had it with ruling! There’s
no law (dharma) in that! Given this, I’ll go alone to the forest with the
intention of pursuing what’s right (dharma). There in the pure forests,
my rod laid down, my senses restrained, I will honour the law (dharma)
as a sage who eats roots and fruits.
Bh(cid:8)ùma said:
I understand! This notion of yours indeed has the merit of being de-
void of cruelty! But greatness is not served through mere absence of
cruelty alone. On the contrary, do people think much of you for being
gentle, patient, so very noble and pious, an impotent man suffused with
sentimentality for law (dharma)? You must keep in sight the royal
codes (dharmas) that were appopriate for your ancestors; certainly the
like of which you want to engage in is not the conduct of kings! If you
do not participate in this absence of cruelty which is jumbled up with
confusion, you will obtain the fruits of the law (dharma) which result
from protecting the people.
There is intriguing word play going on here. Yudhiùñhira’s intention to
‘lay down his rod’ (nyastadaõóa) when he goes to the forest responds
to Bh(cid:8)ùma’s earlier statement that a king ‘should always hold his rod
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
48 76.19ff. = Mbh 5.75.19ff.
150 CHAPTER FOUR
up high’ (nityam udyatadaõóaþ).49 In this passage, the daõóa, the ‘rod
of punishment’, is the symbol of sovereignty, embodying the king’s
duty to both protect and punish.50 The symbolism of the daõóa has
already been employed in debates over Yudhiùñhira’s crisis. Arjuna
eulogises it at length when he attempts to convince Yudhiùñhira of the
merits of kingship, equating it with dharma itself,51 and using many
metaphors which draw out its rich symbolism. In one example Arjuna
positions the importance of the daõóa in relation to the sanctity of the
sacrifice: ‘if the rod would not be upraised then a bold dog would lick
the oblations’.52 The rod and the holder of the rod protect the sacrifice
from defilement just as the king should protect the earth. In laying
down the daõóa Yudhiùñhira would lay aside the duties of kingship. In
effect he would be impotent, and the fecundity of the earth would be
compromised.53 The phallic symbolism alternates between the king
who proudly displays his masculine power, and the flaccid man who
chooses political impotence. Consider, for example, Draupad(cid:8)’s telling
rebuke of Yudhiùñhira in 14.13-14:
na kl(cid:5)bo vasudh(cid:2)ü bhuïkte na kl(cid:5)bo dhanam a(cid:3)nute|
na kl(cid:5)basya g(cid:8)he putr(cid:2) matsy(cid:2)þ païka iv(cid:2)sate||

n(cid:2)daõóasya praj(cid:2) r(cid:2)jñaþ sukham edhanti bh(cid:2)rata||
An impotent man doesn’t enjoy the earth; an impotent man doesn’t en-
joy wealth. Just as fish can not exist in mud, there are no sons in the
house of an impotent man. Without the rod (daõóa) a kùatriya does not
shine, without the rod (daõóa) he doesn’t enjoy the earth. Nor, Bh(cid:3)rata,

49 76.5a. Cf. (cid:2)DhP 138.7ab, MS 7.102ab, where the same statement is connected
in the following pada with ‘manliness’: ‘the king should always have his manliness
on show’ (nityaü viv(cid:8)tapauruùaþ). Similar ideas are found at (cid:6)P 32.19 and 120.9.
50 See A. Glucklich, “The Royal Scepter (Daõóa) as Legal Punishment and Sacred
Symbol,” HR, 28 (1988), pp.97-122; and below pp.372ff.
51 15.2d. Found also in MS 7.18. In MS 7.17 the king is called the ‘human daõóa’,
cf. MS 7.14kùatriya duty. Arjuna especially, as Biardeau so cogently demonstrates,
has a close connection to all the symbols and functions that coalesce around kingship.
Thus in (cid:6)P 8, as in the presof dharman in the early vedic period. Just as in that early
period, dharman was the instrument by which the cosmos was kept apart, so the
daõóa is the instrument by which the king keeps the various varõas separate in the
pursuance of their own dharmas; in each instance the dharman and the daõóa play a
structurally comparable role, as the instrument of the ‘keeping apart’; but as the daõóa
assumes the role of instrument, so dharma becomes the actual thing ‘kept apart’.

THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE (cid:2)PADDHARMAPARVAN 151
do the subjects of a king happily flourish when he’s without the rod
(daõóa).
This passage directly correlates the symbolism of the rod, the social
identity of the kùatriya and the king, and the king’s virility.54 Without
the rod the king is emasculated, is without identity and without mean-
ing. Denied its king and with its royal lineage broken, the kingdom
would have its fecundity threatened and order destabilised.55 Bh(cid:8)ùma
intimates much the same thing when he suggests that people regard
Yudhiùñhira to be an impotent man (76.19) because of his attachment
to behaviour outside the purview of a king, such as his ’lack of cru-
elty’ ((cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)amsya—discussed also in SU 24), his excessive piety (ati-
dh(cid:2)rmika), his devotion to dharma and so on. Of course, Bh(cid:8)ùma has a
particular kind of dharma in mind here, which stands in distinction
from the dharma he teaches Yudhiùñhira, the dharma of kings, the
fruits of which are Yudhiùñhira’s to enjoy. If Yudhiùñhira ‘lays down
his rod’ he will have no place in the world in which he was born, for
he will have denied the role which forms his identity, his place within
the social system, within the internally differentiated schema of
dharma. By ‘laying aside his rod’ to pursue dharma he will break the
proper order of dharma; and, of course, it is Yudhiùñhira himself as
king who is meant to maintain that order, making his self-
emasculation an even greater violation.
4.2 Yudhiùñhira’s crisis, dharma, and the (cid:2)paddharmaparvan
In light of these discussions, we must now briefly place Yudhiùñhira’s
crisis within the broad trajectory of this book and look forward to the
(cid:2)DhP. In chapter three, two ideological trends were traced which
background Yudhiùñhira’s ambivalence in respect to dharma: the vari-
ous developments of the idea of dharma itself, and the emergence of a
number of movements which challenged the ascendancy of br(cid:3)hmaõic
ideology, which itself was centred on a particular understanding of
dharma. On numerous occasions in this process these two trends in-
tersected each other. Thus while dharma developed out of the vedic
period as a code of conduct within Br(cid:3)hmaõism, it was gradually al-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
54 Yudhiùñhira is also accused of being impotent (kl(cid:5)ba) for not becoming king in
(cid:6)P 8.5 and 10.15.
55 See above p.52 n.49.
152 CHAPTER FOUR
tered within this br(cid:3)hmaõic milieu under the influence of these new
movements. This was so irrespective of whether this is viewed as the
gradual acceptance of new ideas by conservative br(cid:3)hmans, or as the
desire for some proponents of these ideas, associated with the new
movements, to be included within the sphere of br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma.
Furthermore, from the perspective of these new movements, traditions
of dharma were developed which stood to a greater or lesser extent in
opposition to the understanding of dharma in conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic
circles. This opposition can, in simple terms, be seen as an antipathy
between the values developed in renunciant ascetic movements and
Br(cid:3)hmaõism, even though Br(cid:3)hmaõism itself would gradually absorb
aspects of these movements. It could only do this, however, by com-
ing to terms with the broader implications which the values espoused
in these ascetic movements had for the traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic under-
standing of dharma. A caricature of this antithesis would have in one
corner the idea of ahiüs(cid:2) and, in the other, the traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic
view of the king, the individual chiefly responsible for the mainte-
nance of order in society. In performing his duty the king is impelled
to perform violence, whether in punishment, conquest or defence.
Therefore, the central problems of dharma in this encounter between a
conservative Br(cid:3)hmaõism and the various new movements which de-
veloped in the second half of the first millenium BCE are brought into
greatest relief in the figure of the king. This is even further so because
the king is at the very centre of the br(cid:3)hmaõic model of society, he is
the chief patron of the major sacrifices56 and hence, in a sense, can be
understood as the model householder of the br(cid:3)hmaõic world.
It is against this background that we should view not just Yudhi-
ùñhira’s own ambivalence about dharma, but indeed the problems of
dharma portrayed in the Mbh and, especially for our present purposes,
the (cid:2)DhP. As dharma becomes a central concept within br(cid:3)hmaõic/
Hindu tradition—and the tradition itself undergoes numerous changes,
some of which challenge the very core of its ideologies—debates are
undertaken in the name of that very word. Thus the referential base of
dharma alternates between various parameters that become confusing
in themselves, a process which, however, ultimately extends its se-

Links between the Epics, the Pur(cid:3)õas and Their Vedic Sources,” in G. Oberhammer

Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1997, p.77.
THE NARRATIVE FRAME OF THE (cid:2)PADDHARMAPARVAN 153
mantic range. This is revealed especially in the proliferation of com-
pounds in which dharma is the last member, as in the case of mokùad-
harma, which in the early phase of the history of dharma in br(cid:3)h-
maõic contexts would have seemed an oxymoron.57
A(cid:5)oka’s use of dharma offers an interesting contrast to its tradi-
tional br(cid:3)hmaõic understanding and, as such, it is useful to draw com-
parisons between it and Yudhiùñhira’s own ambivalent position in the
debate over dharma. However, as Fitzgerald has pointed out, Sutton
probably overstates the case when he says, “Analysis of the character
and behaviour of Yudhiùñhira shows that he acts consistently in accor-
dance with the understanding of dharma outlined in … the Edicts of
A(cid:5)oka.”58 Yudhiùñhira’s position, as Fitzgerald has argued, is far more
ambivalent, and he frequently yields to the realpolitisch teachings on
r(cid:2)jadharma that Bh(cid:8)ùma delivers, teachings often anathemic to any-
thing the ‘reformed’ A(cid:5)oka might have considered appropriate, at least
as far as can be judged on the basis of his edicts. A(cid:5)oka’s edicts do
offer significant evidence for the kinds of arguments over dharma that
must once have taken place, and hence we can read the Mbh as having
some kind of dialectical relationship to a broad cultural current in
which questions over the nature and content of dharma were of utmost
importance.59 It is in this light that we should frame the (cid:2)DhP.
What is the significance of the usage of the compound (cid:2)paddharma
in this context? We have already seen how it was employed in a
dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stric context, and how the problems a king encounters in
times of distress were explored in the KA (not, however, with any ref-
erence to dharma). I will attempt to show in the commentaries that
follow in chapters six to nine that many of the texts of the (cid:2)DhP draw
heavily on the realpolitisch tradition represented by the KA. Though,
at times, it uses principles drawn from the traditions represented by
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
57 Cf. P. Olivelle, Saüny(cid:2)sa Upaniùads: Hindu Scriptures on Asceticism and Re-
nunciation, Oxford, New York: OUP, 1992, p.53; and the suggestive comments of
Biardeau, “The Salvation,” p.94.
58 Sutton, “A(cid:5)oka and Yudhiùñhira,” p.338; Fitzgerald, “Making Yudhiùñhira,”
pp.64-5, n.7; The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.128 n.199. See also above page 127.
59 It is pertinent to juxtapose in this regard Falk’s recent suggestion that locations
of A(cid:5)oka’s Buddhist inspired MRE I were strategically chosen at pilgrimage sites to
target large crowds during religious festivals (see above p.130 n.196) with Vas-
silkov’s suggestion (“Indian practice of pilgrimage”) that sacred places (t(cid:5)rthas) along
pilgrimage routes were the sites of performances and creations of Mbh-s, a juxtaposi-
tion that evokes an image of Mbh recitations taking place in the shadow of A(cid:5)okan
edicts.
154 CHAPTER FOUR
the dharma literature, the impetus for incorporating the contents of the
(cid:2)DhP within the notion of (cid:2)paddharma, given its realpolitisch con-
tent, was a response from a conservative Br(cid:3)hmaõism alive to the
challenges posed from the various new developments in respect of
dharma that arose both within and without Br(cid:3)hmaõism, as in the dia-
lectical process outlined above. Thus the (cid:2)DhP was a motivated re-
sponse to the heavily debated problems of what constituted the proper
behaviour of a king in respect to dharma and, consequently, what in
fact was dharma. In one sense, therefore, the (cid:2)DhP collection can be
seen, in part, as a rhetorical effort to consistently ‘rename’ the Real-
politik of the br(cid:3)hmaõic model of kingship as dharma, which fre-
quently does little to alter that Realpolitik in any essential sense, a
process which is only necessitated and, indeed, effective because
dharma itself has gained new ‘moral’ weighting from the ‘absolutist’
applications mapped out above.60 The (cid:6)P (and the Mbh), in making a
comprehensive statement on dharma through the RDhP, (cid:2)DhP and
MDhP, contributes much to the great debate over dharma, a contribu-
tion that, in many ways, is unique in the history of the development of
the concept and application of dharma, developments which would
have a decisive influence on its subsequent use.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
60 This is not to say that the application of dharma in a conservative br(cid:3)hmaõic
context did not have moral implications. But there is clearly a difference between the
moral connotations of dharma in texts like the dharmas(cid:6)tras, and in the edicts of
A(cid:5)oka, or even the argument Yudhiùñhira attempts to put past his family in the open-
ing chapters of the (cid:6)P.
(cid:3)
CHAPTER FIVE
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION
While the previous chapters described the conceptual background to
the ideas found in the diverse texts of the (cid:2)DhP, this chapter is con-
cerned with the actual method of the combination of these texts, that is
to say, with their mode of presentation. As such, it is a prequel to the
commentaries on the (cid:2)DhP that follow in subsequent chapters. If the
(cid:2)DhP is indeed a collection of texts, as I think it must be viewed, then
how has it been put together? What strategies of integration did the
(cid:2)DhP’s authorial/redactorial agents employ in fashioning the collec-
tion into a whole that exhibits, in some sense of the word, coherence?
These questions shall be approached from two angles. First, by inves-
tigating the ways in which the (cid:2)DhP is integrated into its broader nar-
rative contexts, i.e., of the (cid:6)P and the Mbh. And second, by identify-
ing the means by which the (cid:2)DhP’s diverse texts are integrated into
the (cid:2)DhP itself. Much of this chapter will be concerned with particu-
lar aspects of the framing and interloctory system of the (cid:2)DhP, since
it is primarily this system that fashions the (cid:2)DhP’s texts into a whole.
Firstly, however, I will make mention of some other narrative strate-
gies through which the (cid:2)DhP’s texts, and hence the (cid:2)DhP itself, are
integrated into the (cid:2)DhP’s encompassing narrative frameworks.
5.1 Integrative agents and transitional texts
The first of these narrative strategies takes the form of allusions or
references to characters of the Mbh, or events that have occurred
elsewhere in the Mbh. Such intertextual ‘epic allusions’, which
demonstratively evoke the characters and deeds of the Mbh, are found
throughout (cid:5)(cid:3)stric literature (indeed in most Sanskrit literatures), yet
they acquire particular resonance when referred to in the course of the
‘text’ (broadly conceived) to which they belong. The (cid:2)DhP’s physical
and thematic framing by the Mbh thereby takes on added significance,
since it is a framing explicitly foregrounded by certain texts of the
(cid:2)DhP itself, demanding that they be read against its background.
Even the particular characters who take part in the dialogues which
156 CHAPTER FIVE
make up the (cid:2)DhP function to integrate these texts into their broader
narrative context. The most important and self-evident examples of
this are Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira, the key participants in the (cid:2)DhP’s
primary interlocutory frame. What is perhaps more intriguing, how-
ever, is that some texts of the (cid:2)DhP also refer to or feature other cen-
tral Mbh characters. Two minor examples refer to epic characters as
exemplars (or anti-exemplars) for a particular virtue being given fo-
cus. In the first, Arjuna’s defeat of the eleven Kaurava akùauhiõ(cid:5) ar-
mies is offered as an example of someone who ‘relied upon his might
in battle’ (balam (cid:2)sth(cid:2)ya … m(cid:8)dhe), since the eighteen armies of the
war were not the equal of him in might (151.32-3). The second evokes
the epic’s anti-heroes, the Dh(cid:2)rtar(cid:2)ùñras (‘sons of Dh(cid:7)taraùñra’), as
exemplars of the vices described in SU 23, vices that Yudhiùñhira is
being warned off (157.18).1
More substantial cases occur in two of the closing texts of the
(cid:2)DhP (SUs 26 and 27),2 in each of which epic characters other than
Bh(cid:8)ùma or Yudhiùñhira play substantial roles. Nakula assumes Yudhi-
ùñhira’s position as Bh(cid:8)ùma’s co-interlocutor in SU 26 ((cid:2)DhP 160),
and all the P(cid:3)õóava heroes, along with Vidura (one of Yudhiùñhira’s
advisors3), engage in a six part dialogue called the ùaóg(cid:5)t(cid:2) in SU 27
((cid:2)DhP 161). Detailed analyses of these texts are presented below. The
feature to be noted for the time being is that, along with the two
briefer instances already noted, these are not merely casual occur-
rences, but are governed by a logic of character in which the specific
traits and deeds of each hero resonate beyond their citation. As such,
they are agents of integration, their narrative significance lying in their
capacity to draw the audience out of the immediate confines of their
citation or narrative circumstance into the broader frameworks of the
(cid:6)P and the Mbh.
A second narrative feature that belies the supposedly amorphous
character of texts like the (cid:2)DhP is the presence of transitional texts,
which effect the movement from one sub-parvan to the next. I am
thinking here especially of RDhP 128 (SU 1), and (cid:2)DhP 152-167
(SUs 18-27). Belvalkar’s brief and dismissive discussion of the latter
set of texts is typical of the disregard for such attributes: “The rest of
the (cid:2)paddharma contains some abstract discussions on merit and de-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 157
merit, and on specific virtues which are not of much interest or impor-
tance.—Questions are also asked, towards the end, by another brother
of Yudhiùñhira, to which apt replies are given by Bh(cid:8)ùma. The topics
are not all definitely connected with the current context.”4 Underlying
a view such as this is the simplistic assumption that every text in the
(cid:2)DhP must concern (cid:2)paddharma as such. Just as the final text of the
RDhP (128, SU 1) seems to have been designed to introduce many of
the principal themes of the (cid:2)DhP,5 if due consideration is given to the
broader narrative design of the (cid:2)DhP as part of the royal instructions
of the (cid:6)P, then the connection of the (cid:2)DhP’s concluding texts to their
context readily reveals itself. They appear as texts that frame both a
conclusion to the formal period of royal instruction represented by the
RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence6 and an introduction to the MDhP. Their transi-
tional positions, and their complementarities and juxtapositions to sur-
rounding texts, reveal a significance too easily overlooked.
Such matters will be discussed further in the commentaries to these
texts. For now, with the three texts contained in SUs 25-7 as exam-
ples, I shall briefly flag some key points as they pertain to the question
of the integration of these texts into the (cid:2)DhP and into broader textual
parameters. Even though the first of these texts, the pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citt(cid:5)yam
(SU 25, (cid:2)DhP 159), lacks many of the rhetorical features that typi-
cally serve to integrate individual texts into their immediate narrative
contexts, one can still fruitfully speculate on a rationale behind its lo-
cation between the (cid:2)DhP and MDhP. Its position between a section
on (cid:2)paddharma and a section on ‘liberation’ (mokùa) mirrors a logic
of action demanded by (cid:2)paddharma since, in theory, purification
through penance must always follow a period of crisis that entails an
‘impure’ remedy; its position thereby exhibits a purposive design.
The second text, SU 26, in which Nakula asks Bh(cid:8)ùma about the
origin of the sword, has broader narrative parameters in view. It
frames the conclusion of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence in bestowing on
the P(cid:3)õóava heroes the ‘sword’ (metonymically linked to the daõóa,
the ‘rod of coercion’ symbolically linked to sovereignty) that has
passed down through a lineage of divinely inspired dharma protectors.

158 CHAPTER FIVE
It is a charter that, on the one hand, symbolises the P(cid:3)õóavas’ matura-
tion under the royal revelation of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s tutelage and, conse-
quently, the P(cid:3)õóavas’ readiness to assume their duty, and that, on the
other hand, legitimises their assumption of this duty. It can be no mis-
take that variations of the underlying mythologem of this myth occur
at the extremities of the (cid:6)P’s royal instructions, first with the P(cid:7)thu
myth of the origin of kingship at the beginning of the RDhP in Mbh
12.59, then the origin of the daõóa towards the end of the RDhP in
Mbh 12.121-2, and finally the ‘origin of the sword’ towards the end of
the (cid:2)DhP in Mbh 12.160. These royal instructions are framed, there-
fore, with myths that dramatise the problems and resolutions of the
central themes of these texts: the excesses of, and the proper and judi-
cious application of, royal power.
Finally, the ùaóg(cid:5)t(cid:2), the dialogue or ‘song’ in six parts, thematically
concludes the royal instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence, while
introducing the thematic space of the MDhP. The fraternal multi-
participant structure of this text reflects a structural motif found else-
where in the Mbh, most significantly in a sequence of texts early in
the (cid:6)P which concern a similar topic to SU 27 (but with a different
outcome). Indeed, I shall argue that SU 27 is best understood as a re-
sponse to this earlier multi-participant dialogue, where the difference
in outcome structures a loose ‘narrative arc’ to the (cid:6)P. Despite, there-
fore, the (cid:2)DhP being a collection of diverse didactic texts, the narra-
tive demands of beginning, middle and end still impose themselves,
or, rather, have been imposed on the collection, establishing a sense of
progression and broader coherence—principally through the transfor-
mation experienced by one its principal interlocutors, but also through
the strategic placement of particular texts—even if this is in a looser
sense than might be the case in other narrative modes. That these inte-
grative strategies tend to occur at transitional nodes reflects the fact
that it is precisely in these transitional texts that broader issues of syn-
tactic cohesion are at stake.
The remainder of this chapter will be concerned with the specific de-
tails of the framing system of the (cid:2)DhP. Firstly, some matters of
methodological and theoretical interest will be discussed; secondly, an
analysis and discussion of the interlocutory system of the (cid:2)DhP; and
then a more detailed analysis of some framing motifs and individual
features of the interlocutory-framing system, especially such rhetorical

units as pra(cid:3)nas, ‘statements of intent’ and ‘concluding statements’
that effectively ‘pace’ the narrative.
5.2 Frame analysis
In his doctoral dissertation, Fitzgerald describes the MDhP as a collec-
tion of texts directed to “the broad theme of mokùa”, that “someone
collated … into an anthology” even though there seems to be no “ap-
parent doctrinal unity to the collection”.7 And again, further on, “The
MDh[P] is unmistakably an anthology of texts by different authors,
deliberately constructed for some purpose great or small.”8 This cita-
tion has two significant ideas: that the MDhP had a ‘plurality of au-
thors’9 and that it was ‘deliberately constructed’. Accordingly, Fitz-
gerald makes a distinction “between the redactorial framing and the
text proper”, and further posits “the priority of the text”; that is to say,
each of the texts of the MDhP has had an existence prior to its inclu-
sion in the collection.10 Fitzgerald further holds out hope to “identify
elements of the anthology as contributions of the putative redactor
which makes the collection more than a collection”,11 and proceeds to
analyse three aspects of the text which might thereby reveal the redac-
tor’s hand: Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)nas, the internal arrangement of the col-
lection, and “some texts of the collection which may have been com-
posed by the redactor”.12
The first of these aspects has particular relevance for us here be-
cause it concerns the framing procedures of the MDhP. Fitzgerald ob-
serves that the “questions, formulas and comments” of Yudhiùñhira
and Bh(cid:8)ùma join the “collected texts into a single didactic anthology”,
which further connects them to the entire Mbh,13 and he proposes to

7 “The Mokùa Anthology,” p.279.
8 “The Mokùa Anthology,” p.280.
9 This reflects also the ‘pluralism’ with which Bh(cid:8)ùma initiates his discussion on
matters of mokùa. See “The Mokùa Anthology,” p.279: “We have seen that the an-
thology is consciously directed in a ‘pluralistic way’ to the broad topic of mokùa, and
that the collection itself proves true to Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial ‘pluralism’.” Cf. “The Mokùa
Anthology,” pp.227ff.
10 Cf. The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.148: “The first part of RDh[P] instructions was
definitely assembled from preexisting texts ...”

13 “The Mokùa Anthology,” p.282.
160 CHAPTER FIVE
isolate these elements from the rest of the text in order to identify “a
meaningful set of intellectual interests”. In actual fact, for reasons
both of economy and his view that Bh(cid:8)ùma’s contributions add “little
new of interest”, he pays attention almost exclusively to Yudhiùñhira’s
pra(cid:3)nas. Fitzgerald’s approach is partly prompted by his observation
that sometimes there is a discrepancy between the various framing
devices and the actual texts they enframe. Hence there is a “misappro-
priation of the text”, or “a partial appropriation which attempts to
make a particular use of the text as it is absorbed into the anthology by
emphasizing one or another aspect of it”.14 What follows is a list of
every pra(cid:3)na (or not, as in the few cases where none is evident) ac-
companied by a brief synopsis of each connected text.15 Fitzgerald
calls this collection of framing elements the “putative redactor’s text”
and concludes, perhaps unsurprisingly, that the “text has little or no
depth of its own” and that these elements “fall into no pattern, make
no particular point in themselves”.16 Indeed, they merely function to
loosely integrate the texts into a “defined space in the Great Bh(cid:2)rata”,
contributing barely anything to the “intellectual interests which did
obviously concern the redactor”.17 Finally, he suggests that in intellec-
tual terms, as distinct from their broader narrative purpose in the con-
text of the Mbh, the function of the framing elements is to anticipate
the subsequent text they enframe, sometimes in a way that clearly in-
dicates their composition “in the train of the specific text”.18 Fitzger-
ald’s method of abstracting the pra(cid:3)nas from the text that they embed
and attempting to see in them some identifiable set of ‘interests and
themes’, and therefore reading this string of questions as a text in it-
self, leads, however, to something of a distortion. Indeed, in the end,
Fitzgerald ends his “search for a significant text over and above the
collected texts of the MDh[P] by admitting that such a text does not in
fact exist”.19
Fitzgerald seems quite unimpressed by the results of his analysis of
the pra(cid:3)nas,20 yet by focussing on the framing elements of the texts of

20 Fitzgerald’s approach has been critiqued by A. Hiltebeitel, “Bh(cid:8)ùma’s Sources,”

the MDhP, his approach offers a valuable precedent. However, rather
than isolating these elements from the texts that they enframe, pra(cid:3)na
(as short hand for the ‘redactor’s’ framing devices) and embedded text
are better understood as forming a unit,21 as “two elements in a coher-
ent narrative context”.22 In contemplating the semantic creativity in-
volved in the combination of ‘framing’ and ‘framed’ elements, we can
take our lead from ‘frame theory’, a loosely defined field that draws
largely on the work of the anthropologist Gregory Bateson. In his
seminal essay, “A Theory of Play and Fantasy”,23 Bateson argued that
in order to understand any act of communication one must understand
its communicative context; there are messages immanent within the
communicative act which tell us how to understand this communica-
tion, and these stand over and above the simple ‘denotative level’ of
the linguistic or other items (such as gestures, and so on) which make
up the message. He calls these ‘metacommunications’, communica-
tions about communication, and demonstrates this idea with the ex-
ample of monkeys he had observed in a zoo: even though two mon-
keys were engaged in behaviour that was similar to fighting, both
clearly recognised that they were really playing, thus they had “at least
some awareness … that the signs about which they metacommunicate
are signals”.24 Metacommunicative messages such as these can be un-
derstood in a metaphorical way as the frames through which experi-
ences are interpreted.25 This metaphor is readily familiar in the Indian
context in the well known literary device of embedding, a device for
which the Mbh is a notable exemplar. This metaphor, however, can be

Asko Parpola, Studia Orientalia, vol.94, Helsinki: Finnish Oriental Society, 2001,
p.263: “… I believe Fitzgerald exaggerates the likelihood of a high percentage of pre-
existing texts, and underestimates the creativity of the “redactorial agent”, which was
probably a group or committee …”
21 Fitzgerald seems to dismiss this approach. See “The Mokùa Anthology,” p.282:
“Conceivably the individual frame proper to each text might be a valuable and inter-
esting guide to the general interpretation of the purport of the text, functioning like a
brief, very general commentary. A more interesting reading of the frame, however,
might be to search for redactorial tendencies, to see if there are any noticeable patterns
in the way particular themes are handled by the redactor.”

applied in other ways as well. For example, in an all too obvious and
consequently easily undersestimated sense, the Mbh frames the (cid:2)DhP
and hence prompts a reading of the themes and issues of the (cid:2)DhP
against the broader concerns of the Mbh.
In the syntactic arrangement of a text like the Mbh, framing is less
a metaphor than the actual description of the case. At its most basic
level, the frame of the (cid:2)DhP—like that of the RDhP instructions
which precede it and, for the most part, the MDhP and DDhP which
follow it—can be understood to consist of questions and answers usu-
ally delivered by Yudhiùñhira and Bh(cid:8)ùma respectively. These ‘ques-
tions and answers’ frame various textual units which can be isolated
from the body of the text, such as saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas, but also
numerous lessons given directly by Bh(cid:8)ùma, and designated frequently
in the colophons with titles like pra(cid:3)aüsana, or simply adhy(cid:2)ya, and
therefore also understandable in some sense as ‘texts’ in their own
right. Furthermore, the frames of these texts consist of various rhetori-
cal elements employed as parts of the interlocutory system (analysed
further below, see the table in FIGURE 8), the most significant of
which, as Fitzgerald notes, are the pra(cid:3)nas and ‘concluding state-
ments’. While these devices perform the ‘surface’ duty of structuring,
or moulding the various elements in the (cid:2)DhP into a whole, they also
tell us something about the way these various texts should be under-
stood. In Bateson’s words, they perform a ‘metacommunicative’ func-
tion in respect to the units they embed and, as Blackburn says in re-
gard to a slightly different literary context that also employs a tech-
nique of framing, “the decision to place a tale within a frame repre-
sents an act of interpretation”, it is an “exegetical gesture towards the
tale”.26 Both the framing elements of each text, and the text thereby
embedded, can be read against each other. The various framing de-
vices of the (cid:2)DhP, therefore, count among the repertoire of narrative
strategies that the epic authors employed to create an integrated, syn-

tactically coherent text; but, in performing this function, these devices
not only provide a ‘box-like’ structure to contain multiple texts, they
also overtly direct the reader’s/hearer’s attention in decisive ways by
articulating the interpretive context of each text.
In the next two sections I explore in greater detail some of the ele-
ments which constitute the framing devices of the (cid:2)DhP. These sec-
tions give particular attention to the integrative function of these de-
vices; while in the subsequent chapters, which consist of commentar-
ies on each text of the (cid:2)DhP, more sustained focus is given to the par-
ticular ways in which these devices direct the attention of the reader.
5.3 Interlocution and framing
In the Mbh and other Indian texts, such as the pur(cid:2)õas, ‘interlocution’
and ‘framing’ are complementary and interrelated processes. Such
devices in these texts have been the subject of important studies by
Minkowski27 and Bailey.28 Framing is the process by which one story
or narrative is embedded within another in a manner that is both hier-
archical, in as much as narratives are embedded within narratives, and
sequential, since an embedded narrative must begin after, and finish
before, the narrative in which it is embedded.29 The interlocutors are
the ‘actors’ who do the embedding. The outer frame of the Mbh is a
conversation in the Naimiùa forest between a group of sages led by
(cid:6)aunaka and the s(cid:6)ta Ugra(cid:5)ravas. Embedded within this is the Mbh’s
inner frame, a conversation between Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and Janamejaya,
in which Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana tells the Bh(cid:3)rata story to Janamejaya at
Vy(cid:3)sa’s bidding.30 A further level of narration must be postulated too,
in which we are told about Ugra(cid:5)ravas and the sages. This anonymous
voice is the implicit bedrock upon which all other frames are ulti-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
27 “Janamejaya’s sattra.” Minkowski develops M. Witzel’s suggestion that literary
framing is founded on the stuctures of ritual in “On the origin of the literary device of
the ‘frame story’ in old Indian literature,” in H. Falk (ed.) Festschrift f(cid:11)r Ulrich
Schneider, Freiburg 1987, pp.380-414.

30 While the outer frame spans the entire Mbh, the inner frame does not begin until
Mbh 1.54.
164 CHAPTER FIVE
mately founded.31 For the vast majority of the epic the outer frame of
Ugra(cid:5)ravas and the sages, which opens and closes the Mbh, is ‘invisi-
ble’, though the narration recedes to its level on a number of important
occasions.32 In between, however, its existence must be inferred, since
we know that it is the conduit through which the inner frame of the
Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana/Janamejaya dialogue is being made known.33
The experience of the telling of the vast majority of the Mbh is pri-
marily felt, therefore, on the interlocutory level of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and
Janamejaya, which is also the base-line level of interlocution in the
(cid:2)DhP, as the diagram in FIGURE 7 indicates. Yet, in both quantitative
and narrative terms, the primary interlocutory level in the (cid:6)P is not
that of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and Janamejaya, rather it is embedded within
this dialogue and forms its next level of framing. After approximately
the first fifty-five chapters of the (cid:6)P, which depict the direct aftermath
of the war and involve a variety of actors as interlocutors,34 the (cid:6)P
moves into the topic of r(cid:2)jadharma.35 From this point onwards the
(cid:6)P’s narrative largely takes the form of a dialogue between Bh(cid:8)ùma
and Yudhiùñhira, and Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s presence is felt only on rare oc-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
31 Cf. Guy Petterson (“Time, Knowledge and Narrative in the Agni Pur(cid:3)õa,” La
Trobe University doctoral dissertation, 1997, pp.22f.) who refers to an “anonymous
narrator”; and Fitzgerald’s (“The Many Voices,” p.804 n.9) “outermost voice”. On the
other hand, Hiltebeitel (Rethinking, pp.34, 92-4, 165-6, 278-81, 300, 371; “The
N(cid:2)r(cid:2)yaõ(cid:5)ya and the Early Reading Communities of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,” in P.Olivelle
(ed.), Between the empires: society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE, New York: OUP,
2006, pp.229-30) regards this as the Mbh’s “outermost” “authorial frame” in which
Vy(cid:3)sa recites the Mbh to his five disciples (Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana
and his son (cid:6)uka), a point on which I am not yet entirely convinced (see also Fitzger-
ald, “The Many Voices,” pp.815-17 for a critique of Hiltebeitel on this point).
32 See Hiltebeitel, “The N(cid:2)r(cid:2)yaõ(cid:5)ya,” p.320 n.10 (noting brief “dips” to this frame
at Mbh 2.46.4 and 15.42-3) and passim in which he extends the arguments of
Gr(cid:10)nendahl and Oberlies (in P. Schreiner (ed.), N(cid:2)r(cid:2)yaõ(cid:5)ya Studien, pp.49-53 and 79-
83 respectively) regarding a number of errors made by Belvalkar, editor of the critical
edition of the (cid:6)(cid:3)ntiparvan, in excising passages from the N(cid:3)r(cid:3)yaõ(cid:8)ya also involving
“dips” to this outer frame.
33 Minkowski, “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.405.
34 Some of this has been explored above, pp.135ff.
35 Yudhiùñhira first poses his questions concerning r(cid:2)jadharma in the context of his
dialogue with Vy(cid:3)sa in 12.38 (see above pp.146f.), who refers him to Bh(cid:8)ùma. These
questions are reiterated and expanded upon in 12.56, and then Bh(cid:8)ùma begins his dis-
course. Tokunaga has recently argued (“Udakakriy(cid:2) and the (cid:6)(cid:3)ntiparvan,” in P.
Koskikallio (ed.), Epics, Khilas and Ruptures: Continuities and Ruptures, Proceed-
ings of the Third Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and
Pur(cid:3)õas September 2002, Zagreb: Croation Academy of Sciences and Arts, 2005,
pp.169-81) that the first series of questions is part of the “original (cid:6)(cid:3)ntiparvan” which
ended around Mbh 12.45.

casions (which, however, have their own significance—as discussed
below). The syntactic cohesion of the (cid:2)DhP is provided, therefore, by
the frame in which Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira are the interlocutors,
whilst the syntactic cohesion of the (cid:2)DhP within the (cid:6)P and the entire
epic is established through the frame in which Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and
Janamejaya are the interlocutors.36 There is a sense in which this co-
hesion is engineered merely by the regular appearance of the same
interlocutors again and again, establishing a rhythm to which we be-
come accustomed and, consequently, a predictability that creates a
kind of binding continuity within the text. Frequently, however, the
interlocutors also establish rhetorical connections between one unit
and the next in their speeches. This is particularly so for Yudhiùñhira,
as we will see in the next section of this chapter.
The narration of the (cid:2)DhP unfolds according to a pattern already
set in place in the RDhP, with Bh(cid:8)ùma delivering a teaching to his
(cid:3)iùya Yudhiùñhira. This varies on only two occasions. In the first of
these (SU 26), Nakula takes the place of Yudhiùñhira as Bh(cid:8)ùma’s co-
interlocutor, without altering the fundamental structure in any signifi-
cant manner, while in the second (SU 27) Yudhiùñhira engages his

36 Bailey, Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.40: “The cohesive success of the frame interlocutory
system occurs, from one point of view, because of its spatial presence ... across the
whole expanse of the narrative. This gives the narrative a kind of syntactic cohesion.”

four brothers and Vidura in conversation. Despite these variations, the
significance of which shall be discussed later,37 the vast majority of
the (cid:2)DhP is presented as a didactic dialogue between Bh(cid:8)ùma and
Yudhiùñhira. Yudhiùñhira provides the impetus for the narrative with
questions or requests for knowledge,38 and Bh(cid:8)ùma obliges with an
answer to these questions. Often this answer involves a move to the
(cid:2)DhP’s third level of framing, where Bh(cid:8)ùma employs various saü-
v(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas to illustrate his main points. The levels of
framing and interlocution are represented by the diagram in FIGURE 7.
In this diagram, level one represents the interlocutory level occu-
pied by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana. His discussant, Janamejaya, is reduced almost
entirely to listening and therefore rarely interevenes in the (cid:2)DhP,
though we infer his existence as the person who receives Vai(cid:5)aü-
p(cid:3)yana’s monologue and, occasionally, Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana refers to him
with a vocative.39 There are of course two further levels of narration
that I have not represented here, that of Ugra(cid:5)ravas and the sages (the
Mbh’s outer frame) and the anonymous narrator on the outermost
level, both of which are co-extensive for the (cid:2)DhP with level one in
the diagram.40 Level two is occupied by Bh(cid:8)ùma, the principal inter-
locutor, Yudhiùñhira, and briefly his four brothers and Vidura, who are
also present throughout Bh(cid:8)ùma’s discourse.41 Level three indicates the
saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas Bh(cid:8)ùma employs to illustrate his lessons.
These are entirely framed within Bh(cid:8)ùma’s speech units, and he is the
only interlocutor on level two to employ them. There is also a fourth
level of interlocution, contained within the brief dialogue represented
by k8. The dialogues on level two are entirely enframed within the
dialogue on level one of the (cid:2)DhP. The gaps in level two indicate
where these interlocutors are ‘interrupted’ by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana on level
one. Such interruptions tend to occur, as Minkowski has noted,42 at
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
37 See below pp.372ff. and 382ff.
38 Similarly, in the inner frame Janamejaya’s questions (and in the outer frame the
sages’ questions) provide the impetus for Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s (and Ugra(cid:5)ravas’) narra-
tion. See Minkowski, “Janamejaya’s sattra.”
39 E.g. (cid:2)DhP 154.38, 161.48 and 167.24.
40 The outermost level of narration does not, of course, involve exchanges between
interlocutors (though see also Hiltebeitel in n.31).
41 All of the P(cid:3)õóavas gather before Bh(cid:8)ùma in 12.54. Yudhiùñhira appoints Vidura
as one of his chief advisors in Mbh 12.41.9 and, though it is not explicitly mentioned,
should probably be assumed to have accompanied him to Bh(cid:8)ùma’s side. Bh(cid:8)ùma dis-
misses Yudhiùñhira and his ‘advisors’ (am(cid:2)tyas) at the end of the DDhP (13.152.4).
42 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.403.
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 167
transitions in the narrative. Yet, though this has the effect of interrupt-
ing the narrative, strictly speaking there is no interruption at all, since
Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana has never really stopped speaking; all interlocution
above level one is reported to us via Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana, and all above
level two via Bh(cid:8)ùma. Interlocution and framing are thus different
ways of describing what in the Mbh is one and the same process.
The up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas and saüv(cid:2)das on the third interlocutory level
elaborate the central points made in the (cid:2)DhP’s primary interlocutory
frame (Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira) which functions on a strictly didactic
plane at the second interlocutory level. The dynamics operating be-
tween these two planes will be explored in each of the commentaries
on the SUs. The saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas Bh(cid:8)ùma employs (num-
bered k1-k11 in FIGURE 7, cf. FIGURE 8) are entirely enclosed narra-
tive units that generally have no narrative relation from one to the
next,43 though they may share thematic continuities that are occasion-
ally foregrounded in the framing matter. The lines on level three indi-
cate the approximate length from the first speech made by the first
interlocutor in a narrative to the last speech made by the last interlocu-
tor in the same narrative in comparison with the extent of the (cid:2)DhP.
The up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na or saüv(cid:2)da itself may be longer than this. In the up(cid:2)-
khy(cid:2)na marked ‘k2’ (SU 8: the ‘tale of the three fish’), for example,
the actors make only brief speeches and the rest of the story is told by
Bh(cid:8)ùma in the past tense. Bh(cid:8)ùma frequently intervenes between the
passages of interlocution on level three, reporting either the actions of
the participants in the stories or, occasionally, their psychological
states. The grammatical shift from present tense to past tense clearly
separates the reported speech of the actors of an up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na or a saü-
v(cid:2)da from the narrated action of the same unit.44 Occasionally (e.g. k1,
k4, k5 and k8) Bh(cid:8)ùma forgoes interrupting a narration for an extended
length of time. This seems to occur when the actors engage in charac-
teristically didactic dialogue in which there is no action to describe,
and the psychological states of the actors are either apparent from
their speeches, or are not important.45 In these cases, just as Vai(cid:5)aü-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
43 Bailey (Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.42) notes similar structural characteristics in the
Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa; cf. Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.146.
44 Cf. Bailey, Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.44, and p.83: “It is the conjunction of the context
he [the frame interlocutor] establishes and the present tense utterances of the episodic
interlocutors which produces the finished up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na ...”.
45 Cf. Bailey, Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.44: “The dialogue entered into by the episodic in-
terlocutors expose the emotions and attitudes of the characters who speak the dia-

168 CHAPTER FIVE
p(cid:3)yana ‘disappears’ while he is reporting Bh(cid:8)ùma’s discourse, so
Bh(cid:8)ùma ‘disappears’ from the narrative he reports, and we feel more in
the presence of the (present tense speaking)46 actors participating in
the story. This qualitative difference is mirrored in the rhetorical struc-
ture of the narrative. When an interlocutor on an interlocutory level
‘disappears’ (i.e. their presence is implicit but not felt) the speeches of
the interlocutors that this level frames tend to be introduced by prose
speech markers independent of the proper limits of a verse (e.g.
bh(cid:5)ùma uv(cid:2)ca, p(cid:6)jany uv(cid:2)ca).47 On the other hand, when there is a
greater degree of intervention from the frame, speeches tend to be in-
troduced within the limits of the verse. This is seen also when
Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s frequency of intervention increases in chapters 160-1
(SUs 26-7), where all the speeches from the P(cid:3)õóavas and Vidura are
enclosed within the limits of verses. After this passage, when the nar-
rative returns to the standard pattern of Bh(cid:8)ùma responding to Yudhi-
ùñhira’s questions, Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana once again ‘disappears’ from the
narrative, and the interlocutors are introduced by the common ex-
verse speech marker. This effect is produced in spite of the fact that,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
logues, whereas, in contrast, whenever a frame interlocutor ... intervenes it is to de-
scribe the actions of the episodic interlocutors.” I am not convinced of this distinction,
at least in the (cid:2)DhP. Whilst it is true, I think, that in the (cid:2)DhP the majority of
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s interventions in the level three narratives function to describe the actions of
the interlocutors, I find it difficult to see how this would not involve a description of
the emotions, attitudes or psychological states of the actors. For example, when in
(cid:2)DhP 166.2 Bh(cid:8)ùma says of one actor in an up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na (the k(cid:8)taghnop(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nam) that
“the fearless king of cranes slept on his side”, this is a clear description of both a psy-
chological (fearless) state and an action. Both are crucial for the narrative. The de-
scription of ‘the king of cranes’ as fearless implies that there is, in fact, something to
fear, and the anticipation of the ‘thing to be feared’ builds tension. The important
function of such a description would preclude an argument that this psychological
description is subsidiary or secondary to the action. Furthermore, a description of
action can also convey emotional or psychological states. For example, an actor weep-
ing or crying in pain (as in 166.15) clearly conveys an emotional/psychological state
of distress, suggesting that it is not so easy to separate narration of action from the
description of psychological/emotional states since often they are one and the same
thing. Perhaps the cogent point is that the frame interlocutor does not gratuitously de-
scribe emotional and psychological states; if they are clearly conveyed within the
speeches of the actors in the up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas and saüv(cid:2)das found on level 3 of the
(cid:2)DhP’s interlocutory system, then the frame interlocutor does not repeat the dose.
46 It is the actors speaking in the present tense in the up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas and saüv(cid:2)das,
just as it is for Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira, that gives them, as Bailey says, “... a contem-
porary ambience even though it is a record of events that have occurred in the past”,
Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.83.

lag Dr. Kovac, 1994, pp.75-7.
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 169
strictly speaking, interlocutors on each further framing level out are
narrating these speech markers.
There is a further qualitative difference between the frame inter-
locutors (and this is relevant for both the level two frame in FIGURE 7
mostly represented by Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira, and the level one
frame of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and Janamejaya) and some of the interlocu-
tors of the saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas. In his volume on the Gaõe(cid:3)a-
pur(cid:2)õa, Greg Bailey has discussed the differing styles of ‘dialogue’
that are found on the different interlocutory levels of the pur(cid:2)õas. The
designation of pur(cid:3)õic narration as a “dialogic mode of utterance”
needs to be seriously qualified,
as the two sets of interlocutors only become involved in a dialogic rela-
tionship in order to facilitate the continuation of the narrative ... Ac-
cordingly, dialogue here becomes a device of narrative deliverance, a
function which must be kept totally separate from that kind of dialogue
which involves characters interacting in dramatic roles where the dia-
logue plays a function in relation to the purely descriptive passages nar-
rated by the frame interlocutor.48
The important difference this citation highlights is the generally
higher degree of interactivity between the actors of the episodes (as
found on level three in FIGURE 7) in distinction from the frame inter-
locutors (levels two and one). In the first instance, as Bailey says, “the
dialogic texture is very strong”,49 whereas in the second the dialogue is
in the service of a monologue. Though to this I would make one ad-
dendum, in keeping with an earlier comment I made, that the didactic
quality of some of the saüv(cid:2)das means that these too can take on a
highly monologic style.50 It would therefore be more accurate to say
that, at least in regard to the (cid:2)DhP, the more overtly didactic any nar-
rative is, the more monologic it is likely to be also.
In those up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas and saüv(cid:2)das where the interlocutors vigor-
ously interact, the relationship between the interlocutors tends to be
that of equals, or at least of actors who think they are equals, or who
incorrectly perceive the status relationships of the actors in the narra-
tive. In fact it is often the superiority of one actor over the other (a
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
48 Bailey, Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.75.
49 Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.77.
50 In k1 (SU 6), k5 (SU 11), and k8 (SU 15) this is particularly so, and in k4 (SU
10) it becomes more and more highly marked the further the narrative progresses,
becoming increasingly didactic in the process.
170 CHAPTER FIVE
superiority of which the inferior actor is generally unaware) that pro-
vides much of the narrative drive of these episodes. Typically they
depict situations in which the actors regularly contradict each other, or
engage in competitive debates based on a principle of equality or on a
certain structure of hierarchy, but that reveal inequality (i.e. inferiority
or superiority in wisdom or strength), or the opposite hierarchical
structure to that which they assume at the outset of the tale. A mono-
logic narrative style in the texts of the (cid:2)DhP, however, tends to in-
volve, at the very least, the recognition of subordination on behalf of
one character, as operates between the (cid:2)DhP’s frame interlocutors,
Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira, whose relationship is based on a clear under-
standing of status, the pattern of their discourse following from this
mutual understanding.
This monologic style, therefore, reflects the authoritative status of
Bh(cid:8)ùma, the primary interlocutor of the (cid:2)DhP, and serves the didactic
and ideological goals of those behind the formation of this didactic
corpus. Such an analysis can be further extended to Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana—
on level one of the framing system (the ‘inner frame’ of the Mbh) as it
is experienced in the (cid:2)DhP—since the extended discourse he is deliv-
ering to his co-interlocutor Janamejaya displays much the same struc-
ture as that delivered by Bh(cid:8)ùma, despite it covering almost the entire
Mbh and featuring narrative styles with greater generic variety than
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s. The wisdom of the learned Bh(cid:8)ùma/Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana is being
imparted for the edification of the (relatively) ignorant Yudhiùñhira/
Janamejaya.51 The participation of the naïve receptors of the discourse
functions to let their co-interlocutors know what else they want to
know, thereby providing the impetus for the narration. This takes on
different characteristics depending on the style of teaching that is be-
ing imparted. The story of the Mbh is a peculiar kind of lesson, it is
the ‘story of his ancestors’ being told to Janamejaya. He listens in rapt
attention as the narrative unfolds at its own pace, with only the occa-
sional need for interruption to encourage Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana to elaborate
or continue or clarify, and along the way he learns about who he is,
about his place in an eminent lineage, and all the implicit lessons the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
51 In an interesting inversion of this model, however, this is not extended to the
‘outer frame’ of the Mbh in which Ugra(cid:5)ravas delivers his Mbh to the sages led by
(cid:6)aunaka in the Naimiùa forest. In this frame, the sages (or at least (cid:6)aunaka) appear to
already know everything that Ugra(cid:5)ravas will tell them, as Hiltebeitel has pointed out
in Rethinking, pp.102-4.
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 171
story conveys and the explicit lessons the didactic corpora portray. In
Yudhiùñhira’s case, on the other hand, what is being taught to him in
the didactic books is intimately tied on a rhetorical level to what it is
that Yudhiùñhira wants to know, hence the absolute need for his regu-
lar questions and admissions of ignorance to drive the narrative of the
didactic books forward. Even on the two occasions when there is a
change in interlocutor, there is no shift from this basic structure: in the
first Nakula takes Yudhiùñhira’s position as the ignorant interlocutor,
while in the second it is still Yudhiùñhira who provides the question
driving the narrative, though he too also provides the answer, a subtle
inversion of the usual structure which itself signals that something
significant has occurred to Yudhiùñhira during the course of his in-
struction in royal duties.
The monologic characteristic of the governing Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira
interlocutory frame reflects what Hans Robert Jauss has said of the
‘didactic question’, “the didactic works its way towards a fully devel-
oped canon, a canon that organises a catalogue of necessary, and that
often means authorised, questions in terms of a closed doctrinal sys-
tem of answers”, and “the priority of the question over answer serves
to privilege the authority of the teacher and the dialogic search for un-
known truths ends in the monologic assertion of a single truth”.52 The
employment of Bh(cid:8)ùma as the main interlocutor bolsters the pedagogic
and ideological purposes of the didactic corpora that he narrates; his
honour and authority, the respect the epic heroes naturally afford him
as their pit(cid:2)maha, the ‘divine eye’ granted him by K(cid:7)ùõa (12.52.20),
his authorising by Vy(cid:3)sa and the ultimate ‘sources’ of his wisdom in
the guise of various famous »ùis,53 all contribute to render the author-
ity of the didactic corpora unimpeachable, since to question it would
be to question Bh(cid:8)ùma. While, on the one hand, Yudhiùñhira’s ques-
tioning fulfils the requirement of ‘connective tissue’ between in-
structions on different topics, on the other hand it serves a discourse
function, where the opening signalled by the question is, in a sense,
artificial. The question is predetermined and already ‘authorised’ in
the sense suggested by Jauss. Therefore, while it is the questions of
the naïve interlocutor that typically provide narrative coherence, and

172 CHAPTER FIVE
his ignorance provides the causal impetus for the narrative, both serve
the further discourse function of obscuring the broader ideological
purposes of the didactic corpora.
5.4 Narrative motifs and rhetorical types
This analysis of the strategies that establish textual cohesion can be
extended to some of the motifs and types of rhetoric that effectively
‘pace’ and cohere the narrative. In particular I discuss here the speech
patterns of the participants on interlocutory level two, since it is
mainly on this level that the (cid:2)DhP operates and hence is most signifi-
cant for the question of the internal cohesion of the (cid:2)DhP. Of particu-
lar importance are certain rhetorical devices employed by the frame
interlocutors that fix a particular unit within the larger textual corpus
to which it belongs (e.g. (cid:2)DhP, (cid:6)P, Mbh), and provide continuity be-
tween units, some of which have been discussed by Minkowski in his
important study of the inner and outer frames of the Mbh.54
But before moving to the rhetorical features that constitute the
frame of the (cid:2)DhP, I first contrast some of the motifs found at the
beginning of the frames Minkowski discusses, with the motifs of the
Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira frame as it begins in the RDhP. The contrasts be-
tween these frames are interesting for what they say about the type of
narratives the RDhP, (cid:2)DhP and MDhP purport to be.55
5.4.1 Before a narrator begins
Minkowski speaks of two motifs that appear at the beginning of a
frame, those of the “arrival of the narrator” and “showing the narrator
hospitality”.56 Both motifs serve similar functions, even if they per-
form them in different ways. Each, for example, elaborates the setting
in which the actors relate their narratives, thereby providing an intro-
duction to what follows, or a transition from one narrative frame to the
next or, as in most cases, both. In the sacrificial sessions in the Mbh’s
inner and outer frames, the main interlocutors are introduced and their
links to the epic characters are established. For Janamejaya this is his
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
54 Minkowski, “Janamejaya’s sattra,” pp.407-12.
55 And for that matter, the DDhP.
56 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.408.
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 173
relationship to the epic heroes, a relationship that in effect historicises
the epic, linking its mythic heroes to the unfolding of the quasi-history
represented by Janamejaya, the son of the only survivor of the heroic
lineage. For the narrators in each frame, the sage Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and
the bard Ugra(cid:5)ravas, it is their link to the composer of the epic, Vy(cid:3)sa,
one of the most enigmatic characters in the epic, a link that establishes
their authority to tell the story.57
Motifs of hospitality also establish the interlocutors’ status, particu-
larly as it relates to their co-interlocutors, as this quote from Min-
kowski suggests, “The arrival of a guest and the hospitality accorded
him are characteristic ... only if that narrator merits such courtesy.”58
The ritual contexts of each frame also perform important contextualis-
ing functions. Hiltebeitel has suggested that the Mbh’s outer frame, in
which the s(cid:6)ta Ugra(cid:5)ravas recites the epic to a group of sages at a sat-
tra in the Naimiùa forest, provides a context where on a symbolic
level the stories transcend time.59 Conversely, it is, as Minkowski has
shown, the inner frame’s real time context that provides a believable
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
57 In Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s case this link is clearly spelled out when his guru Vy(cid:3)sa di-
rects his student ((cid:3)iùya) to relate the breach (bheda) of the Kurus and Paõóavas just as
he had heard it from Vy(cid:3)sa (Mbh 1.54.21-22; 1.55.1-3). Ugra(cid:5)ravas’ links to Vy(cid:3)sa
are established more circuitously, but no less significantly, as he constructs for him-
self an authorising line of transmission through intermediaries between himself and
Vy(cid:3)sa (typically his father the s(cid:6)ta Lomaharùaõa and the br(cid:3)hman sage, student of
Vy(cid:3)sa and principal interlocutor of the Mbh’s inner frame, Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana). In the first
instance he explains to the sages in the Naimiùa forest that he has recently been at
Janamejaya’s snake sacrifice for Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s telling of various tales concerning
the Mbh that had been proclaimed by Vy(cid:3)sa (1.1.8-10). (Ugra(cid:5)ravas gives more de-
tails on Vy(cid:3)sa’s composition and immediate transmission of the Mbh in 1.1.46-64;
see also. 1.57.74-75.) In the second instance (in the ‘second introduction’), Ugra-
(cid:5)ravas admits to having learnt all that his father Lomaharùaõa had learnt from Vai(cid:5)aü-
p(cid:3)yana and other br(cid:3)hmans, and then agrees to relate the lineage (vaü(cid:3)a) of the
Bh(cid:7)gus, the lineage of his principal interlocutor the sage (cid:6)aunaka (1.5.4-6). In a third
instance that does not, however, occur at the beginning of the frame, Ugra(cid:5)ravas
agrees to tell the ancient itih(cid:2)sa of the br(cid:3)hman (cid:2)st(cid:8)ka, which Vy(cid:3)sa had formerly
expounded upon in the Naimiùa forest, and which he had learnt from his father Loma-
harùaõa, a student of Vy(cid:3)sa (!) (1.13.1-8).
58 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.409.
59 Hiltebeitel, “Conventions of the Naimiùa Forest,” JIP, 26.2 (1998), pp.162-3. In
a sense, the ‘Naimiùa forest’ convention is an elaborate analogue of the ‘once upon a
time’ beginning to fairy tales, which Jauss (Question and Answer, p.14) describes as
“imaginary and indeterminant (sic)” and outside of historical time. Minkowski sees
the setting of the story in the Naimiùa forest as a way for the Mbh to solve the narra-
tive problem of an “infinite regression of frames” by “fixing the text at a level beyond
which … one cannot go further” (“Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.420). For other discussions
of the Naimiùa forest, see also Petterson, “Time, Knowledge,” pp.25-7.
174 CHAPTER FIVE
setting for the telling of the epic, since there are regular intervals in
the ritual action that “provide for the telling of stories”.60 And fur-
thermore, in the setting at a sarpasattra, the sacrifice that threatens to
destroy all snakes, the frame “interlocks thematically with the epic it
introduces”,61 thereby prefiguring the action that follows. If these mo-
tifs perform these functions in the Mbh’s inner and outer frames, how
are such effects achieved in the Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira frame of the di-
dactic corpora of the (cid:6)P? How are the relations of the interlocutors
established, and what significance does the setting have for the dis-
course it hosts? And how does this contrast with the frames Min-
kowski discusses?
The first thing to note is that, in contrast to those motifs in the
frames Minkowski analyses, the introductory scene to our frame con-
tain no ‘arrival of the narrator’ sequence, despite the fact that, as Min-
kowski says, “The seated audience welcoming the wandering bard is
part of the formulaic diction of the epic.”62 Rather, there is an inver-
sion of this standard structure: it is Yudhiùñhira along with his allies,
the audience for Bh(cid:8)ùma’s discourse, who arrives before Bh(cid:8)ùma. This
is for obvious narrative reasons, since Bh(cid:8)ùma is incapable of move-
ment, lying on a bed of arrows provided by Arjuna after he had shot
him down. However, the inversion is particularly striking given that
the setting in which the narration takes place is highly reminiscent of
the ritual settings found in the Mbh’s inner and outer frames. The epic
poets go to much length to evoke images of sacrality and ritual at the
place where Bh(cid:8)ùma lies; indeed Bh(cid:8)ùma himself is compared to the
‘fiery evening sun’ in a way that suggests his position analogous to an
agni in a ritual setting.63 An extensive list of eminent sages and the

61 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.404. Cf. C. Minkowski, “Snakes, Sattras, and the Ma-
h(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,” in A. Sharma (ed.), Essays on the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, Leiden: Brill, 1991,
pp.384-400.
62 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.407.
63 The ailing Bh(cid:8)ùma is actually compared to a ‘dwindling fire’ ((cid:3)(cid:2)myann iva
hut(cid:2)(cid:3)anaþ) in 12.46. 11, and again in 12.50.12 ((cid:3)(cid:2)myam(cid:2)nam iv(cid:2)nalam). The imagery
of the fiery sun resonates on a number of levels, since Bh(cid:8)ùma chooses to peg his re-
maining life to the sun’s course: he will live on his bed of arrows while the sun con-
tinues its southern course (dakùiõ(cid:2)yana), and will die when the sun turns for its north-
ern course (uttar(cid:2)yana, udag(cid:2)yana) (58 nights from his fall, 13.153.27; cf. 12.51.14
‘56 days left’; at 13.143.4 he complains of the sun’s slow pace). See especially Mbh
6.114.88-9, 94-8, 115.48-9; this is continually restated, e.g. 12.46.29, 47.3, 51.16,
291.4; 13.152.10, 153.6, 26; 14.59.12. In battle he is compared to the sun ‘blazing in
the middle of the day’, e.g. 6.45.56-7, 55.64, 102.50, 72, 74 (cf. 6.16.41, 17.18).
(cid:3)
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 175
‘foremost of br(cid:3)hmans’ surround him,64 and he is, of course, on Kuru-
kùetra, the ‘field of dharma’,65 “the exemplary Vedic and epic ritual
terrain as sacrificial altar of the gods”,66 and the site of the great sacri-
fice of the just-completed battle. After arriving at Bh(cid:8)ùma’s side for
the first time, this remarkable scene, so highly reminiscent of sacrality
and ritual, greets the P(cid:3)õóavas (12.50.6-7):
tatas te dad(cid:8)(cid:3)ur bh(cid:5)ùmaü (cid:3)araprastara(cid:3)(cid:2)yinam|
svara(cid:3)mij(cid:2)lasaüv(cid:5)taü s(cid:2)yaüs(cid:6)ryam iv(cid:2)nalam||
up(cid:2)syam(cid:2)naü munibhir devair iva (cid:3)atakratum|
de(cid:3)e paramadharmiùñhe nad(cid:5)m oghavat(cid:5)m anu||
They then saw Bh(cid:8)ùma lying on the bed of arrows, appearing like the
fiery sun at dusk surrounded by a garland of its own rays, being wor-
shipped by sages, like he of a hundred sacrifices [Indra] by the gods, in
that place of great merit beside the river Oghavat(cid:8).
Both of these factors suggest that by evoking a pseudo-ritual ambience
the epic poets are constructing a scene which shares in the sacrality
the inner and outer frames display, yet are also adding a degree of al-
teration by inverting the ‘arrival of the narrator’ motif in keeping with
the kind of discourse that will occur between the interlocutors. This is
reinforced by a further significant difference. For, as Minkowski says,
the audience in both the inner and outer frames of the Mbh is already
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
Pierced by arrows, he is compared to the sun with its rays in 12.47.4; in 13.27.14 he is
attended in the same way as those who are ‘skilled in mantras’ attend the rising sun
(udyantam (cid:2)dityam). And lying on his bed of arrows he is often compared to the
‘fallen sun’, e.g. 6.15.58; 7.3.4; 11.23.15; 12.53.27, 54.6. It should be no surprise,
therefore, that he is described not so much as dying as ‘setting’ (astam + (cid:2)i), e.g.
6.14.11, 15.13; 11.23.15-16; 12.46.23, 54.8. On Bh(cid:8)ùma and his connection with the
course of the sun, see also G. von Simson, “The mythic background of the Mah(cid:3)-
bh(cid:3)rata,” IT, 12 (1984), pp.195, 209-10 and “Narrated time and its relation to the sup-
posed Year Myth in the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,” in M. Brockington and P. Schreiner (eds),
Composing a Tradition: Concepts, Techniques and Relationships, Proceedings of the
First Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Pur(cid:2)õas, August
1997, Zagreb: Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 1999, pp.60-1.
64 12.47.4ff., 12.53.25-6 and 12.54.4. Some of these eminent sages engage in dis-
course with Yudhiùñhira in Mbh 13.18.
65 12.53.23c kùetraü dharmasya k(cid:8)tsnasya kurukùetram| Hara (“A Note on the
Phrase Dharma-kùetre Kuru-kùetre”) has recently suggested that dharma in this phrase
is meant in its “religious” sense (by which he essentially means merit) rather than its
“ethico-legal” sense. That this field is the setting for the great instructions in dharma
delivered by Bh(cid:8)ùma (i.e. in the r(cid:2)ja-, (cid:2)pad-, mokùa- and d(cid:2)na-dharmas), suggests
that dharma in this phrase, as in so many of its applications, cannot easily be reduced
to any single sense.

established and engaged “in some continuous sedentary activity”
when the “storyteller wanders in”.67 By implication the telling of the
story occurs by happenstance, in as much as the sages take advantage
of what is, for them, a chance occurrence: a bard (i.e. Ugra(cid:5)ravas) or
sage (i.e. Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana) walking in on their sacrificial session. In the
(cid:6)P, however, the P(cid:3)õóavas and their surviving allies go to Bh(cid:8)ùma
specifically to hear him speak, and Yudhiùñhira expresses considerable
anxiety that they should present before him in an appropriate fashion.68
Indeed it takes Yudhiùñhira some time to overcome his shame at the
events of the war—in particular Bh(cid:8)ùma’s fall in which he had a
prominent and less than savoury part to play—and address him.69
This coalescence of similarities and differences suggests that,
within the constraints imposed by a particular narrative context, the
epic poets played with frame conventions in a conscious manner, ma-
nipulating their configurations with full awareness of other frame ‘op-
tions’.70 Contrasts and similarities between the various frames point,
therefore, to differences between the narratives that they enframe. In
the Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira frame there is a gravity given over to the
meeting between these two chief participants in the subsequent dia-
logue that is missing from the equivalent scene in the Mbh’s outer
frame71 and, if not missing, is certainly granted greater force than that
which occurs in its inner frame. This gravity reflects the seriousness of
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s pronouncements, pronouncements made all the more com-
pelling for the prior events of the war, King Yudhiùñhira’s role in that
war and his general uneasiness with its outcomes. And it is a gravity
in keeping with Bh(cid:8)ùma’s eminence for those that approach him too.
For he is the P(cid:3)õóavas’ pit(cid:2)maha, their patriarch, whose feet his stu-
dents approach and sit before, treating him with honour for his wis-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
67 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.408.
68 See 12.53. In particular, after saying that the troops should not join them,
Yudhiùñhira says in 12.53.16: adyaprabh(cid:8)ti g(cid:2)ïgeyaþ paraü guhyaü pravakùyati|
tato necch(cid:2)mi kaunteya p(cid:8)thagjanasam(cid:2)gamam|| ‘From today onwards the son of
Ga(cid:13)g(cid:3) shall speak the highest secret, therefore, son of Kunt(cid:8) (Arjuna), I don’t want
just anybody to gather before him!’
69 12.54-5. For the theme of Yudhiùñhira’s guilt, see pp.135ff. above.
70 Cf. Hiltebeitel, “Conventions,” p.163, who has shown that the poets could create
new conventions about Naimiùa forest sattras. See also Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the
Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, pp.92-176.
71 See Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, pp.99, 102-3, who discusses Ugra-
(cid:5)ravas’ somewhat ambivalent reception by the sages in the Naimiùa forest.

dom and authority, a wisdom and authority reflected in the ritualised
setting and confirmed by K(cid:7)ùõa (12.54.29):

And, Bh(cid:8)ùma, whatever you shall say to the curious P(cid:3)õóava will abide
on the surface of the earth like pronouncements from the Veda.
5.4.2 Rhetorical types: coherence as a manner of speaking
Some of the types of rhetoric that establish the surface structure and
coherence of the (cid:2)DhP have already been discussed by Minkowski in
his article on the Mbh’s frames. His main concern, however, is how
these types relate to the question of formulaic language in the epic
(and the attendant supposition of the oral origins of the epic), a ques-
tion that has increasingly concerned scholars in recent years.72 My fo-
cus does not follow from a concern with either a history of the produc-
tion of the text, or the possible oral nature of this production, though
these are, of course, important questions too.73 It is for this reason that
I speak of rhetorical types rather than formulaic diction, for my con-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
72 See e.g. Minkowski, “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.411. On formulas and the oral ori-
gins of the Mbh, see for instance Brockington, The Sanskrit Epics, pp.103ff.; J.W. de
Jong, “Recent Russian Publications on the Indian Epic,” Adyar Library Bulletin, 39
(1975), pp.1-42; J.W. de Jong, “The Study of the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata. A brief survey (part
II),” Hokke Bunka Kenkyu, 11 (1985), pp.1-21 (both of these are summaries of Rus-
sian works by Grinster and Vassilkov); and J.D. Smith, “Formulaic Language in the
Epics of India,” in The Heroic Process: Form, Function and Fantasy in Folk Epic,
edited by B. Almquist et al., Dublin: The Glendale Press, 1987, pp.591-611. For a
more recent review J. Brockington, “Issues involved in the shift from oral to written
transmission of the Epics: a workshop report,“ Schreiner et al. (eds), Composing a
Tradition: Concepts, Techniques and Relationships, Proceedings of the First Dubrov-
nik International conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Pur(cid:2)õas, August 1997, Zagreb:
Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 1999, pp.131-8.
73 Though, as Brockington says, the fact that formulaic repetitions have their roots
in oral composition “does not mean that the epics were always oral productions”, The
Sanskrit Epics, p.103. Hiltebeitel has recently suggested in “Reconsidering Bh(cid:7)gu-
isation,” (M. Brockington and P. Schreiner (eds), Composing a Tradition: Concepts,
Techniques and Relationships, Proceedings of the First Dubrovnik International con-
ference on the Sanskrit Epics and Pur(cid:3)õas, August 1997, Zagreb: Croatian Academy
of Sciences and Arts, 1999, p.155) that both the Mbh and the R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa were “written
by Brahmans over a much shorter period than is usually advanced”. This is expanded
upon in his recently published volume Rethinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, esp. pp.17-31. In
“India’s Fifth Veda,” pp.150-6, Fitzgerald too has argued for a fixed written text of
the Mbh early in its history that was “the base of the entire manuscript tradition”; cf.
Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.xvi n.2 and p.82 n.15.
178 CHAPTER FIVE
cern is to analyse these types as strategic devices employed for the
narrative ends of establishing textual coherence. Thus I will concen-
trate more on literary effect than on orality or text history. As a conse-
quence, a feature such as the repetition of diction will be understood
to perform a literary function, where the semanticity of such diction is
not underplayed and its repetition, rather being merely regarded as an
after effect of an oral compositional history, is viewed as part and par-
cel of a conventionalised structure of literary form.
Given this approach, my units of analysis will not be reduced
merely to the manner in which they display features of formulaic dic-
tion. I shall refer to these formulas, since they represent some of the
more recognisable features that identify these rhetorical types, but I do
not propose to provide a comprehensive analysis of this aspect of the
text. Instead, my approach is closer to that of Bailey, who discusses
the combinatorial strategies employed in the pur(cid:2)õas, strategies that
are analogous to those employed in the Mbh.74 I am interested in the
manner in which types of rhetorical statements frame other literary
units within the text, binding disparate elements into a coherent whole
that has an intelligible structure. The most obvious kinds of literary
units I am referring to are the saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas that feature
on the third interlocutory level discussed above. But there are other
units as well, which do not necessarily involve a shift to another inter-
locutory level, such as, for example, various pra(cid:3)aüsanas.
Whilst the rhetorical types can be said to create coherence on a sur-
face level, they also must have deep semantic influence as well, for
without them the text would appear merely as a collation of elements,
whose continuity would be entirely left to the reader to establish or not
establish as he or she pleases. It would be naïve, of course, to think
that a reader/listener could not do this anyway. However, the point is
that the (cid:2)DhP (and, indeed, the Mbh) is not ‘passive’, it is not a mere
collation of disparate elements left for the reader to cohere. Rather the
epic poets exerted explicit control over their material in order to inte-
grate the diverse texts they collected together into the (cid:2)DhP. The suc-
cess of that enterprise is a different, if related, question, to that of the
identities of the features which are evidence of that enterprise.

STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 181
The table in FIGURE 8 is a breakdown of the rhetorical types that
structure each semantic unit of the (cid:2)DhP (for the semantic units see
FIGURES 1-4). The divisions between semantic units are not created
through an arbitrary principle all of my own, for as this table, and
those of FIGURES 1-4, indicate, they generally follow chapter divi-
sions, the extent of saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas, or a question/answer
syntactic relationship, and usually a combination of these. Much of
what I now say will depend upon and lead into the discussions of each
of the semantic units of the (cid:2)DhP that will follow in the next four
chapters.
The notation in this table requires some explanation. I have distin-
guished between various kinds of rhetorical types on the one hand—
by which I mean those devices that are employed on the level of the
(cid:2)DhP’s frame interlocutors75 to create coherence between other units
within the text—and literary units (LU column) on the other. The lat-
ter consist of saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas (k1-k11, cf. FIGURE 7), and
various other types of units which I have grouped under the title ‘les-
sons’ (L), since they are designated in the colophons by various terms
indicating their similar attributes such as lakùanam, pra(cid:3)aüs(cid:2), pra-
(cid:3)aüsanam, m(cid:2)h(cid:2)tmyam, adhy(cid:2)ya and kathanam.76 For the present dis-
cussion the often minimal differences between the latter are not as
important as their distinction from the former.
The columns P, LS, SI, IS, RC and CS, respectively represent
Pra(cid:3)nas, Link Statements, Statements of Intent, Initial Statements,
Requests for Clarification and Concluding Statements. The pra(cid:3)nas,
questions or interrogations from one interlocutor to the other, are per-
haps the least problematic of these units. On all bar one occasion (Na-
kula in SU 26) they are spoken by Yudhiùñhira, and on all bar one oc-
casion (the ùaóg(cid:5)t(cid:2) in SU 27) they are addressed to Bh(cid:8)ùma. The
pra(cid:3)na sequences display a high degree of formulaic diction, accord-
ing to either one or more of the three types indicated by Minkowski.77
Most commonly they employ interrogatives (e.g. SUs 1, 2, 3, 9, 10,
11, 12, 15, 17, 22, 26, 27, 28), some of which exhibit less common
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
75 Primarily level two (Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira) of the diagram in FIGURE 4, but occa-
sionally level one (Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana). Similar devices are also employed in up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas
and saüv(cid:2)das, a fact important for discussions of formulaic diction, as well as for the
cohesion of that particular unit, but which will not concern us here.
76 Some of these generic designations do not appear in the titles I use for each SU
since there is some variation in the way the manuscript colophons designate each unit.

interrogative forms, such as kiü svid eveha dharm(cid:2)õ(cid:2)m (20), kiü svid
praharaõaü (cid:3)reùñhaü (26), kiü nu (cid:3)reya ihocyate (20), asti svid
dasyumary(cid:2)d(cid:2) (13)78 and in some manuscripts of the northern recen-
sion kaccit pit(cid:2)mahen(cid:2)s(cid:5)c (16). Second person imperatives requesting
the main interlocutor to speak are frequent too. In particular tan me
vy(cid:2)khy(cid:2)tum arhasi (9 & 28), sarvaü vy(cid:2)khy(cid:2)tum arhasi (28), tan me
br(cid:6)hi pit(cid:2)maha (12, 20, 22), tat sarvaü br(cid:6)hy atandritaþ (20), the
irregular tasm(cid:2)d brav(cid:5)hi kauravya (24), the alliterative prabr(cid:6)hi pra-
pit(cid:2)maha (26), yath(cid:2)vad vaktum arhatha (27), sarvam etad vadasva
me (9), dharmas taü vadasva me (14), enasas tad vadasva me (15), ke
kùam(cid:2)s t(cid:2)n vadasva me (28) and y(cid:2)th(cid:2)tathyena me vada (23).79 Finally
there are a number of variations on the combination of the infinitive
(cid:3)rotum with the first person form of (cid:2)iù, tad icch(cid:2)mi ... (cid:3)rotuü (9),
etad icch(cid:2)my ahaü (cid:3)rotuü (9), (cid:3)rotum icch(cid:2)mi tattvataþ (19), satyaü
icch(cid:2)my ahaü (cid:3)rotuü (22), and (cid:3)rotum icch(cid:2)mi p(cid:2)rthiva (28). It
should be apparent that any one sequence of pra(cid:3)nas may combine
more than one of these forms.
Link statements (LS) refer to those cases in which there is some
kind of reference to a preceding unit. These divide into three types:
those that occur in conjunction with pra(cid:3)nas, those that occur with
statements of intent and, significantly, those that occur through inter-
ventions by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana from the frame of interlocution on level
one of FIGURE 7. The second type always begin with the anaphoric
discourse linker atra, ‘on this matter’, and hence frequently occur in
larger formulas, such as atr(cid:2)py ud(cid:2)harant(cid:5)mam itih(cid:2)sa§ pur(cid:2)tanam.80
SUs 5-8 all contain an atra type of LS. Given the absence of pra(cid:3)nas
in these SUs, if atra is afforded its proper function as an anaphoric
discourse linker in each instance it could then be taken to refer to the
pra(cid:3)nas at the beginning of the (cid:2)DhP (especially in SUs 1-2), since
the content of SUs 5-8 seem to expand on the thematic space these
pra(cid:3)nas open up.81 If this is granted, then these instances of atra
would be similar to other formulas, found in ‘statements of intent’ in
units where there are pra(cid:3)nas, in which case the atra refers back to
that immediate question. Either way, I understand them to have a se-
mantic function that cannot be reduced merely to their formulaic na-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
78 Repeated in 140.34 (column RC, unit 13), see p.184 below.

81 See also below p.224.
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 183
ture. It is for this reason that I include them as ‘link statements’ since
they function to provide more than just an indication of what follows,
particularly in the absence of a pra(cid:3)na. Of the other types, those con-
tained in pra(cid:3)nas spoken by Yudhiùñhira take the form of an acknowl-
edgement of a teaching just delivered by Bh(cid:8)ùma, twice as a straight-
forward acknowledgement (SUs 9 and 19) and twice as an expression
of confusion at what was just taught (SUs 10 and 13). The latter two
function in a similar way to requests for clarification (RC). Those
spoken by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana conform to Bh(cid:8)ùma’s interruptions into the
third interlocutory level, where Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana reports the actions or
psychological states of the level two interlocutors (SUs 20-21, 26 and
27), indicating again the role of the frame interlocutors in the constitu-
tion of a coherent text.
Along with the pra(cid:3)nas, the statements of intent (SI) represent the
most formulaic elements within the text. They are usually spoken by
the main interlocutor Bh(cid:8)ùma and sometimes define the genre and/or
topic of the ensuing discussion. In the (cid:2)DhP they occur in a way
analogous to the descriptions supplied by Minkowski.82 First person
examples are hanta te kathayiùy(cid:2)mi (SUs 11, 20), hanta te vartay-
iùy(cid:2)mi (23), hanta te vartayiùye ’ham (28 [162.28]), atra te varõayiùye
’ham (15) and lakùanaü ca pravakùy(cid:2)mi (22). The second person
statements of intent are the most numerous. All bar two employ the
imperative of (cid:2)(cid:3)ru in either voice: y(cid:2)tr(cid:2)rthaü (cid:3)(cid:8)õu bh(cid:2)rata (1), (cid:3)(cid:8)õv
(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nam anuttamam (8), (cid:3)(cid:8)õu me putra k(cid:2)rtsyena (9), (cid:3)(cid:8)õu kaunteya
yo v(cid:8)tto (10), (cid:3)(cid:8)õu r(cid:2)jan kath(cid:2)ü divy(cid:2)ü (14), (cid:3)(cid:8)õu p(cid:2)rtha yath(cid:2)v(cid:8)ttaü
(16), tac ch(cid:8)õusva nar(cid:2)dhipa (18), (cid:3)(cid:8)õu tac ca vi(cid:3)(cid:2)ü pate (19), tac ca
(cid:3)rotuü tvam arhasi (22), tan me nigadataþ (cid:3)(cid:8)õu (23), tattvaü (cid:3)(cid:8)õusva
m(cid:2)dreya (26 [160.10]); and there are three cases of ni+(cid:2)budh, rahas-
y(cid:2)ni nibodha me (26 [160.81]), vadato me nibodha tvaü (28), and
v(cid:2)kyaü nibodhadhvam ananyabh(cid:2)v(cid:2)þ (27). The latter is spoken by
Yudhiùñhira in triùñubh. Finally, the most obviously formulaic in-
stances occur in the third person. In particular there are five occur-
rences of the much discussed83 atr(cid:2)py ud(cid:2)harant(cid:5)maü itih(cid:2)saü pur(cid:2)-
tanam (6, 9, 11, 12, 17), two cases of atra ... k(cid:5)rtayanti pur(cid:2)vidaþ (5,
7) and one of the somewhat synonymous kavayaþ paricakùate (21).

82 “Janamejaya’s sattra,” p.410.
83 This formular is very common in the (cid:6)P. See e.g. Minkowski, “Janamejaya’s
sattra,” p.410, n.29; Smith, “Formulaic Language,” p.610; Hiltebeitel, “Bh(cid:8)ùma’s
Sources,” pp.263f.
184 CHAPTER FIVE
Once again a number of these types can be included in one statement
of intent.
Initial statements (IS) are not as obviously formulaic. They fall into
two additional sub-categories. In the first there is a brief introduction
to a subject which leads into an up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na or saüv(cid:2)da (SUs 9, 11,
12). In the second the brief introduction prompts a request from the
other interlocutor for more information, which in two cases leads into
a fable (14 & 28),84 and in another leads into the aj(cid:9)(cid:2)n(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)ya (19).
These requests for more information I group in the requests for clarifi-
cations (RC) column. These have similar semantic characteristics to
what Minkowski calls ‘Requests for More’85 yet do not exhibit any of
the formulaic diction he describes. Rather they are in the form of
questions. In two cases they either repeat the pra(cid:3)na that opened the
unit (2), or very nearly do so (13). In the other three cases they are in
the form of more specific questions relating to what the main inter-
locutor has just said in an initial statement (14, 19, 28).
Concluding statements, the final rhetorical type, are sometimes a
little less well defined within the text than the others. Yet there are
clearly a number of features that are found repeatedly at the end of
these units, so while it may be arguable as to the extent of any particu-
lar occurrence, the existence of the general type is less disputable. The
most obvious feature of these statements is that they tend to provide a
summation of, or the final word on, what has been said before. They
recapitulate the central themes or ‘messages’ of the unit.86 In many
cases it is very brief, particularly those units that are ‘lessons’ without
saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas (see table in FIGURE 8). Longer summa-
tions are provided when the didactic message is not clearly related by
one of the interlocutors in an up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na or saüv(cid:2)da (k2 (SU 8), k3
(9), k6 (12), k7 (14), k9 (16), k10 (17), k11 (28)), in which case
Bh(cid:8)ùma further explains the didactic intent of the story.
Those saüv(cid:2)das and up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)nas whose didactic content is not ex-
plained by the frame interlocutor (i.e. Bh(cid:8)ùma), tend to follow an in-
ternal structure that mirrors the Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira frame, in as much
as an authoritative, wise interlocutor gives instructions to a naïve in-
terlocutor. Thus the didactic intent of the story is made clear by the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
84 For further discussion of the formal features of the presentation of this fable, and
its resemblance to the Pa(cid:9)catantra, see below pp.304f.

STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 185
interlocutors of that story. Perhaps significantly, on three of these oc-
casions it is received by a king (k4 (SU 10), k5 (SU 11) and k8 (SU
15)), and on one occasion it is given by a leader to his followers (k1
(SU6)), indicating once again the often homological relationships that
operate between interlocutory levels.87 The concluding statements
made by Bh(cid:8)ùma in these units are, on all bar one occasion (k1),
merely a description of the final acts of the interlocutors, whilst the
authoritative interlocutor within these units provides a summation of
the didactic intent of the unit sharing in some of the features described
below. It is also worth noting that on the two occasions when a con-
cluding statement is either spoken by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana (27), or includes
a verse spoken by him (the last of the parvan in unit 28, 167.24), the
statement follows much the same format: Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana merely de-
scribes the actions of the interlocutors to draw the unit to a close; the
didactic intent of the narrative is made clear to Janamejaya by the par-
ticipants in the narratives.
Commonly, the concluding statements feature an injunction from
Bh(cid:8)ùma for Yudhiùñhira to follow the didactic intent of the unit (SUs
3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 24, 28), and a statement as to the benefits
accrued due to listening to or following what is taught, i.e. a phala-
(cid:3)ruti (SUs 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 26, 28). Some-
times this benefit is described in terms of what one will obtain in ‘this
world’ and ‘the next world’ (SUs 1, 5, 9, 16, 19, 24, 26), though the
diction varies.88 There are other consistencies in the diction worth
mentioning as well. Not surprisingly a concluding statement often be-
gins with the discourse connector evam, particularly when it follows
an up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na or saüv(cid:2)da (SUs 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25),
linking the summation and the content being summarised. Thus in al-
most all of these instances evam is the first word in the first p(cid:2)da of
the concluding statement. On a number of occasions there is a state-
ment from Bh(cid:8)ùma, with varying diction, to the effect that ‘this has
been related by me to you’ (SUs 9, 10, 17, 24, 25, 26, 28). In three of
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
87 In this case the structural homology between the various interlocutory levels is
not just that between authoritative, knowledgeable interlocutor and naïve interlocutor.
The naïve interlocutor in three of these cases is a king, as is, of course, Yudhiùñhira
and also Janamejaya on the Mbh’s inner frame. See also p.170 above. In the brief
dialogue in k8 the summation is provided on the fourth level of interlocution by
B(cid:7)haspati, priest of the gods, where clearly his authority is integral to this occurrence.

186 CHAPTER FIVE
these they are followed by clearly formulaic diction in the fourth
p(cid:2)das of the (cid:3)lokas, kim anyac chrotum icchasi (10), kiü bh(cid:6)yaþ pra-
brav(cid:5)mi te (17), and kiü bh(cid:6)yaþ (cid:3)rotum icchasi (28), formulas that
appear throughout the didactic books.89 A further stylistic feature of
these concluding statements is the occasional shift to a different metri-
cal type. In four of these instances the shift is to an extended (cid:3)loka of
three hemistichs (1, 5, 14, 23),90 on one occasion to the basic triùñubh
(18), and on three to the jagat(cid:5) triùñubh (9, 11, 15).91 Such stylistic
changes draw attention to these concluding statements in a manner
that is in keeping with their emphatic nature.92
Referring back to the table in FIGURE 8, we can see that the most nu-
merically important rhetorical types for structuring the narrative of the
(cid:2)DhP are the pra(cid:3)nas (P), statements of intent (SI) and concluding
statements (CS). This is obviously in keeping with the dialogic nature
of the text, that sees it (for the most part) unfolding in a series of ques-
tions and responses to those questions. Generally speaking, the narra-
tive divides neatly along syntactic lines between the pra(cid:3)nas that initi-
ate the discourse, and the responses to these questions, which are
made up of the statements of intent (SI), literary units (L, k) and con-
cluding statements (CS).93 When employed, the requests for clarifica-
tion (RC) and initial statements (IS) essentially conform to this syntac-
tic structure, though they add further complexity to it. Even if the
pedagogic nature of the (cid:2)DhP demands that the text is in a sense
monological, to the extent that Yudhiùñhira does most of the listening
and Bh(cid:8)ùma most of the talking, it is usually the pra(cid:3)na that provides
the means of progression from one unit to the next or, in its absence, a
combination of link statement and initial statement. It is Yudhiùñhira’s

STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 187
ignorance that makes sensible the demand for Bh(cid:8)ùma to impart his
wisdom. We should be wary, therefore, of dismissing Bh(cid:8)ùma’s ques-
tion ‘What more do you want to hear?’ as merely a formulaic contriv-
ance. Rather, such demands highlight that the narrative function of the
pra(cid:3)na is firmly cemented in the text and, furthermore, that the rela-
tionship between the interlocutors is integral to the pedagogic nature
of the text. Bh(cid:8)ùma himself attests to the significance of the pra(cid:3)na
when, in SU 1 (12.128), he tells Yudhiùñhira that ‘unasked’ (ap(cid:8)ùña) he
cannot discuss the dharmas he wants to hear about.94 Without the
pra(cid:3)na the limitations of a simple monologue would be apparent. For
how otherwise would Bh(cid:8)ùma know what to say in the absence of
Yudhiùñhira’s inquiries? Or, to put it another way, what other narrative
device would so successfully provide a means to shift from one topic
to another, or to open an exploration into a new topic?95
The importance of the pra(cid:3)na as a device to establish at least a sur-
face level of textual coherence can be seen from the relatively few
SUs which do not have a pra(cid:3)na. Sometimes the absence of a pra(cid:3)na
in any particular unit is not overly problematic, since its initiating
function may be found in an earlier unit, as I suggest is the case for
units 4-8. The corollary of this is that we should not always expect
texts like the (cid:2)DhP to unfold according to a simple systematic process
of question followed immediately by an answer to that question. This,
of course, does not alter the basic syntax of question/answer, rather it
introduces a degree of syntactic complexity. Furthermore, other rhe-
torical types within these units can provide mechanisms that fulfil
some of the functions a pra(cid:3)na might provide, for instance, initial
statements may indicate transitions from one unit to another, and con-
cluding statements may embed a unit into its wider narrative context.
Yet, the absence of a pra(cid:3)na is sometimes problematic and high-
lights how important these devices are for establishing narrative cohe-
sion. In particular, SUs 16, 17 and 25 fall into this category. The ab-
sence of a pra(cid:3)na in SU 25 results in an abrupt transition from the
previous unit that is not successfully covered by other mechanisms.
More interesting, however, are SUs 16 and 17, since they reveal the
hand of the tradition of the text’s transmission. While other rhetorical
types within units 16 and 17 provide cohesive mechanisms so that the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

95 Cf. Bailey, Gaõe(cid:3)apur(cid:2)õa, p.76.
188 CHAPTER FIVE
two stories are not left without wider contextualising strategies, the
deployment of a statement of intent without a preceding pra(cid:3)na is
relatively abrupt, and the contextually believable impetus to a new
topic that the pra(cid:3)na provides is missing.96 This is especially due to
the fact that in every other respect these two units follow a certain
structural pattern established in preceding units, in which there is an
immediate syntactic relation between question and answer: Yudhi-
ùñhira asks a specific question which is followed by an excursus by
Bh(cid:8)ùma on the topic of the question, usually involving a saüv(cid:2)da or
up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na. This pattern establishes a stylistic continuity between
units 9-17, and expectations in the reader/listener that this pattern will
be followed. However units 16 and 17 have the excursus without the
pra(cid:3)na. This stylistic break would not be quite so problematic if the
units did not otherwise so closely follow the mould already set; as
readers/listeners we expect stylistic alterations to accompany more
significant semantic or structural alterations that do not really occur in
these units. The textual evidence in the Critical Edition indicates that
the absence of pra(cid:3)nas in these two units did cause problems for the
tradition as well, since some manuscripts of the northern recension
contain pra(cid:3)nas elided from the main text of the Critical Edition.97
These two units are the only cases where there is a significant degree
of dissent as to the existence of pra(cid:3)nas among those manuscripts
used for the Critical Edition, though the occasional manuscript may
omit a question. Presumably these pra(cid:3)nas were elided because they
did not occur in the editorially prioritised (cid:6)(cid:3)rad(cid:3) codex (though they
do occur in other K mss). If we assume, therefore, that their elision
from the Critical Edition was a result of them being ‘later interpola-
tions’,98 then we could at the very least note that the later tradition it-
self was aware of the importance of the pra(cid:3)na in establishing narra-
tive cohesion.
If we concentrate on the relationship between the rhetorical types
within a semantic unit, we can see how tightly structured they gener-
ally are. Though a pra(cid:3)na may not necessarily be solely linked to the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
96 If we compare this to the absence of pra(cid:3)nas in units 5 through 8, we will note
that each of these begin with an atra, suggesting, at the very least, some sense of con-
tinuity between the units. In my view, these anaphorically link these units to the ques-
tions in the first two units, a linkage confirmed by the content of these units.
97See units 16 and 17 in FIGURE 8.
98 Belvalkar further notes that neither choice of pra(cid:3)nas in SU 16 are suitable on
semantic grounds, whilst he provides no further explanation for SU 17.
STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION 189
semantic unit that it is included in—the pra(cid:3)nas of units 1-3, for ex-
ample, frame the (cid:2)DhP in broader narrative terms than the units in
which they are found—the other rhetorical types are always bound in
a strictly syntactical structure. This is for obvious reasons, for it would
be strange if the content introduced by a statement of intent and initial
statement did not immediately follow that introduction. Similarly for
the concluding statements. Their semantic properties are directly re-
lated to their syntactic position in a manner stricter than is the case
with pra(cid:3)nas.
5.5 Concluding remarks
In looking towards the commentaries on each of the SUs in the fol-
lowing chapters, there are two conclusions that ought to be taken from
the present discussion. Firstly, while it has often been said that the
Mbh’s didactic corpora were created and expanded with little attention
to their broader cohesiveness, the above discussion demonstrates that,
at least in regard to the (cid:2)DhP, the (probably multiple) authors or re-
dactors of the didactic corpora, regardless of their text history, were
sensitive to the way the texts they included fitted together. In employ-
ing an extensive repertoire of conventionalised literary strategies and
rhetorical devices, the epic poets clearly attempted to exert control
over the effect produced in combining and juxtaposing the diverse
texts of the (cid:2)DhP into some kind of integrated whole that could be
said to bear more than a casu al relationship to the broader con-
cerns of the Mbh. The occasional absence of those devices that are
typically employed to establish integration is keenly felt, attesting to
the general reasonableness of this proposition.
Secondly, I have put forward the methodological principle that the
devices that frame the (cid:2)DhP—principally the pra(cid:3)nas delivered by
Yudhiùñhira and the statements of intent and concluding statements
and so on of Bh(cid:8)ùma—ought to be read for the ways in which they
direct the reception of each text as part of the corpus to which they
belong. The following commentaries in the next four chapters, there-
fore, develop the view that the texts of the (cid:2)DhP and the devices em-
ployed to frame these texts should be taken together as the unit of
analysis.

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS:
TEXTS ON (cid:4)PADDHARMA I
The following four chapters provide commentaries on each of the se-
mantic units (SU) of the (cid:2)DhP presented in FIGURES 1-4 and FIGURE
8. In these commentaries, I outline the general orientation of each SU
and summarise any saüv(cid:2)da or up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na that it may contain. My
analysis seeks not merely to offer an account of each text in its own
right, but also to account for each text within its broader discursive
context in the (cid:2)DhP and Mbh. In accord with the investigation of
framing and poetic devices in chapter five, I draw appropriate at-
tention to each unit’s poetic form, noting similarities to, relationships
with and differences from other texts in the (cid:2)DhP. I also consider the
broader ideological context of each chapter, as discussed in chapters
two, three and four. For a preliminary, synoptic overview of the con-
tents of these units—and a brief justification for the sub-division of
the (cid:2)DhP into the four broad groupings reflected in the next four
chapters—the reader is referred to the introduction.1
The current chapter, devoted to SUs 1-13 (RDhP 128-(cid:2)DhP 140),
presents commentaries on those texts in the (cid:2)DhP that foreground the
core themes of (cid:2)paddharma as such, themes that are also taken up in
the texts contained in the chapter that follows it. The texts discussed in
these two chapters together constitute the first half of a basic division
in the (cid:2)DhP spelled out in stanza 151.34, on which more will be said
below.2
6.1 ‘In praise of conduct procuring a treasury’
(Mbh 12.128; SU 1)
The first semantic unit upon which I comment is not, strictly speaking,
a part of the (cid:2)DhP, but rather is the last chapter of the RDhP. The in-

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 191
tegration of the themes developed in the (cid:2)DhP with the RDhP ought
to be expected, since the content of the (cid:2)DhP must properly be under-
stood as a continuation of the appropriate dharma for a king; the
(cid:2)DhP is particularly concerned with, though not limited to, the proper
dharma of a king in times of distress.3 The chapter in question, which
is relatively long for one not containing a saüv(cid:2)da or up(cid:2)khy(cid:2)na,
seems, as Fitzgerald points out,4 to have been composed as an intro-
duction to the (cid:2)DhP. Similarly, N(cid:8)lakaõñha calls it a s(cid:6)tra ‘of the
(cid:2)paddharmas about to be described’ (… adhy(cid:2)yo vakùyam(cid:2)õ(cid:2)n(cid:2)m
(cid:2)paddharm(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü s(cid:6)trabh(cid:6)tas …). It is important to consider this chap-
ter not just because of its apparent function as an introduction and
hence transition into the (cid:2)DhP (just as the latter parts of the (cid:2)DhP
also provide a thematic transition into the MDhP), but also because it
makes certain fundamental statements on the topic of (cid:2)paddharma
itself.
The principal argument of this unit is that a king must establish and
maintain a healthy treasury (ko(cid:3)a), and revitalise it when it becomes
depleted. But prior to and in the process of asserting this argument, the
text makes important statements on the relationship of its particular
teachings to dharma. These statements have a broader significance for
the (cid:2)DhP, since, as its ‘introduction’, this text provides an interpretive
framework for the entire parvan. In a similar way, the framing capac-
ity of the pra(cid:3)nas beginning the chapter extend further into the (cid:2)DhP,
beyond the topic that most concerns this unit.

What way is there, Bh(cid:3)rata, for a king who is being abandoned by his
allies, who has many enemies, whose treasury is utterly depleted, whose
army is weak, whose ministers and companions are corrupt and whose
counsels have been made known everywhere; who, seeing no other
way, is losing his kingdom; who has been attacked by an enemy’s army
which is strong while he is weak; whose kingdom has not been taken
care of; who is ignorant of the right time and place; for whom peace or
dissension would be untenable due to the great pressure he is under, and
his life too due to his circumstances. In this case, what would be good
to do?
Together with the pra(cid:3)nas beginning SU 2 ((cid:2)DhP 129), these verses
provide one of the most fundamental parameters of the (cid:2)DhP,
namely, the conditions that establish a period of time as one of dire
crisis, that is to say, one of (cid:2)pad. These parameters fall very much
within a politicised n(cid:5)ti framework, as a comparison with the earlier
discussion of the KA indicates.6 In keeping with the broad similarity
of the (cid:2)DhP and the KA—each being concerned with the main-
tenance of the kingdom and the king’s role in respect to this mainte-
nance—both offer an ‘objective’ description of the conditions of a
time of (cid:2)pad, their similariy extending to the employment of a com-
mon terminology.
6.1.2 Bh(cid:5)ùma’s response to Yudhiùñhira
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s statement of intent (SI) foregrounds a certain uneasiness that
accompanies his teachings on (cid:2)paddharma. Stanza 128.5 is sugges-
tive:
guhyaü m(cid:2) dharmam apr(cid:2)kù(cid:5)r at(cid:5)va bharatarùabha|
ap(cid:8)ùño notsahe vaktuü dharmam enaü yudhiùñhira||
About this secret dharma, you ought not to ask me too much, bull of
Bharatas. Yudhiùñhira, if I’m not asked I can’t speak about this dharma.
With this statement Bh(cid:8)ùma immediately places Yudhiùñhira’s ques-
tions—which in their concern for political affairs (n(cid:5)ti) delineates a
catalogue of political crises—within the sphere of dharma, where the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
6 See above pp.54ff.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 193
issue of proper conduct is always to the fore. But this is no ordinary
dharma: it is guhyam, a ‘secret’, or ‘mystery’.7 This trope suggests
two related things about the nature of the dharma it describes. Firstly,
that this class of knowledge is difficult to grasp, potentially dangerous,
has deleterious consequences, or is easily exploited. Secondly, as a
consequence of the first point, such knowledge must be maintained in
a strict process of transmission that keeps it hidden or secret, thereby
keeping the knowledge from being spread to and exploited by those
considered inappropriate recipients of it. This ‘active’ process of ‘se-
creting’ is suggested in the use of the word guhya itself, since, as a
gerundive, it has a prescriptive aspect: ‘to be concealed’, ‘should be
concealed’.8
The ‘secret’ is a frequent trope in Sanskrit literature. The Mbh itself
describes one of its key narrative devices—the descent of the gods
from heaven to earth with a portion of themselves in order to rescue
her from being overburdened by rampant demons—as the ‘secret of
the gods’.9 Sacred texts and teachings are often declared to be ‘se-
crets’, or restricted to a lineage of students.10 This became so closely
associated with the upaniùads that the word upaniùad itself was often
interpreted to mean ‘secret’, following, apparently, from the secret
connections (upaniùads) which the upaniùads teach.11 In the Mbh, too,
certain teachings of a mystical nature are described as secrets, as in
the case of the Sanatsuj(cid:2)t(cid:5)ya, described in (cid:4)diparvan 2.51 as the ‘se-
cret revelation of the supreme self’ (guhyam adhy(cid:2)tmadar(cid:3)anam).12 In
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
7 The idea of (cid:2)paddharma as a ‘mystery’ or ‘secret’ is found again also in 136.12.
Significantly, Bh(cid:8)ùma responds in that stanza to what he calls Yudhiùñhira’s anu-
pra(cid:3)na, another important idea found in this introductory text (see below p.197)
8 The sense with which it seems to be used in 152.28.
9 Mbh 1.58.3. The ‘portions’ of the gods incarnate in the Mbh’s heroes; the de-
mons incarnate in their enemies.
10 E.g. B(cid:2)U 6.3.12; KU 3.17; (cid:6)U 6.22-23; MaitriU 6.29. The latter three all refer
to their teachings as paramaü guhyam.
11 Cf. A.B. Keith, The Religions and Philosophy, 2 vols, Delhi: Motilal Banarsi-
dass, 1976, pt.2, p.489; Olivelle, The Early Upaniùads, p.24. Note that in the (cid:4)dipar-
van, the conception of the P(cid:3)õóavas by niyoga—itself an (cid:2)paddarma (see above p.50
n.38 and p.54 n.52)—is described as occurring ‘according to a dharma upaniùad’ i.e.
a ‘secret dharma’ (1.1.69ab m(cid:2)tror abhyupapatti(cid:3) ca dharmopaniùadaü prati|). On
this passage see also S.L. Katre, “Dharmopaniùad in Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,” Journal of the
Ganganatha Jha Research Institute, 1 (1943), pp.118-22.
12 Cf. 5.41.3 & 6. The Sanatsuj(cid:2)t(cid:5)ya has, of course, much in common with the upa-
niùads and the BhG (see Brockington, The Sanskrit Epics, p.12; Hopkins, The Great
Epic, pp.28-32). Note also that Vidura cannot speak about this guhyam because he is
not a br(cid:3)hman, thus its transmission is exclusive. Cf. van Buitenen, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,
(cid:3)
194 CHAPTER SIX
these instances, the secret nature of the knowledge to be imparted re-
quires a sage who has special insight into this knowledge. And in
passing such knowledge on to a student, the sage thereby gives him
the power that comes with this knowledge, often a power that en-
hances the student’s prospects for heaven or liberation.
Other kinds of knowledge are designated in the same way, but with
different implications. The Mbh often refers to training in weapons as
both guhya and rahasya. Droõa, for example, asks R(cid:3)ma J(cid:3)madagnya
for all his weapons, along with the ‘secrets for their use’ (saprayoga-
rahasy(cid:2)ni).13 He then becomes the teacher of all the heroes of the
Mbh, among whom his own son A(cid:5)vatth(cid:3)man is said to have been ‘the
best at all the secrets’ (rahasyeùu sarveùu).14 Frequently there is a
mystical aspect to these ‘secrets’, since divine weapons, the divya as-
tras, have magical properties.15 In the famous ‘mountain man’ se-
quence, for example, Arjuna receives a succession of weapons from
divine benefactors along with the secrets of their return (sarahasya-
nivartanam).16 As with other kinds of ‘secrets’ or ‘mysteries’, only
appropriate people are allowed to receive the secrets of these mystical
weapons. Droõa denies Karõa knowledge of the Brahma weapon
‘along with the secret of its return’ (sarahasyanivartanam), on the
grounds that none but ‘a br(cid:3)hman who has duly observed his vows’,
(br(cid:2)hmaõo … yath(cid:2)vac caritavrataþ) or a ‘kùatriya who has per-
formed austerities’ (kùatriyo v(cid:2) tapasv(cid:5)), can know the brahm(cid:2)stra,
presumably because of the power (tejas) needed to control the weapon
(hence the austerities and vows),17 and that such things were restricted
according to social rank.18 The significance of both ‘the secret of a

vol.3, pp.182f. On such secrets, cf. 3.80.38; 83.86; and Mbh (BhG) 6.26.3 (rahasya);
31.1-2; 33.1; 37.20; 40.63-4, 68, 75 (all guhya).
13 1.121.21-2. Earlier, the Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras, P(cid:3)õóavas, V(cid:7)ùõis and others are said to
have learned archery from K(cid:7)pa, who in turn had learnt archery, the different weapons
and all secrets (sarvaü guhyam), from his father, Gautama, who himself had gained
all weapons through tapas. See 1.120.
14 1.123.41.
15 On these weapons see J.L. Whitaker, “Divine Weapons and tejas in the two In-
dian Epics,” IIJ, 43.2 (2000), pp.87-113.
16 3.41.18; 42.27; 45.3. On the weapons Arjuna receives in this sequence see Katz,
Arjuna in the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, pp.95ff.; on all his weapons, see ibid., pp.100-1, n.5.
17 12.2.13. On the necessity for the warrior’s possession of tejas to control a divya
astra, see Whitaker, “Divine Weapons,” pp.98ff., 105. Cf. Biardeau, Études—bhakti
et avat(cid:2)ra, pp.133, 136.
18 Of course, Karõa (unbeknown to Droõa who thought him a s(cid:6)ta) was really a
kùatriya, indeed a warrior whose tejas was so renowned that Yudhiùñhira conspired
(cid:3)
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 195
weapon’s return’, and the imparting of the knowledge of the weapon
to the right person, becomes tellingly clear in the famous Sauptika-
parvan episode. Seeing the five P(cid:3)õóavas returning to camp after he
had slain their surviving warriors, the br(cid:3)hman A(cid:5)vatth(cid:3)man releases
his brahma(cid:3)iras weapon out of fear (10.13.17). Arjuna releases his
own brahma(cid:3)iras to counter A(cid:5)vatth(cid:3)man’s (10.14). Only Arjuna,
however, is able to recall his weapon (10.15.1), since A(cid:5)vatth(cid:3)man, in
his own words, is ak(cid:8)t(cid:2)tman (10.15.15),19 someone who ‘lacks the
preparation’, since he has insufficiently developed the tejas20 needed
to control the weapon’s own tejas.21 Arjuna, on the other hand, can
recall his ‘difficult to master’ (dur(cid:2)sada) weapon because, as a brah-
mac(cid:2)rin, he had observed the truth and his vows, and respected his
teachers (guruvartin).22 The disaster is fully realised when A(cid:5)va-
tth(cid:3)man can only divert his weapon into the wombs of the P(cid:3)õóava
women, thereby all but destroying the next generation. The juxtaposi-
tion is clear, Arjuna is able to control his weapon because his tejas has
been properly cultivated, enabling him to restrain a force capable of
terrible destruction.
The designation of a knowledge as ‘secret’, ‘obscure’ or ‘mysteri-
ous’, therefore, carries with it the implication that it bestows some
kind of power or enhanced facility on those who grasp it. And with
this power comes risk and responsibility, hence its restricted transmis-
sion, a transmission that renders such knowledge ‘secret’ in the first
place. The exclusivity of this knowledge both limits the risks involved
in its application and expands the privilege of those who maintain it.
The analogy of ‘secret weapons’ is especially appropriate to the ideas
expressed in the present passage, since at issue for both is the appro-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
with (cid:6)alya—Yudhiùñhira’s uncle but Karõa’s supposed ally—to betray Karõa by seek-
ing to destroy his tejas. See the introduction to Bowles, Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata. Book 8.
19 Cf. 10.15.7. See also 10.12, which thoroughly undermines A(cid:5)vatth(cid:3)man’s char-
acter and ability to control himself and his weapons. Note especially 10.12.5-7, where
he demands to be taught the brahma(cid:3)iras out of indignation (amarùaõa) at his father
Droõa giving it to Arjuna, and Droõa then teaches it to A(cid:5)vatth(cid:3)man ‘as if not overly
happy’ (n(cid:2)tih(cid:8)ùñaman(cid:2) iva) because he understood his son’s instability (c(cid:2)pala). See
also, W.J. Johnson, The Sauptikaparvan of the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata. The Massacre at Night,
Oxford, New York: OUP, 1998, p.121 n. to 12.5.
20 Whitaker, “Divine Weapons,” pp.101f., 111 n.72.
21 Note how it is the weapon’s tejas, or the type of its tejas, that is frequently cited
as the agent of destruction, or the force which makes it difficult to control, see e.g.
10.15.3, 6-7.

priate application of force. Underlying much of the (cid:2)DhP is the ques-
tion of the king’s appropriate use of force in sustaining or resurrecting
a kingdom. Kùatriyas and kings especially harbour the potential to use
indiscriminate force in the application of their power. Bh(cid:8)ùma signals
this to Yudhiùñhira at the very outset of the (cid:2)DhP by warning him ‘not
to ask too much’ about the secret, dangerous dharma which he wants
to learn. From this lesson, Yudhiùñhira will gain the knowledge of how
and when to use his power in potentially dangerous ways. But with
this license comes the responsibility to recognise the proper limita-
tions of its application. The fact that Bh(cid:8)ùma cannot speak about the
questions Yudhiùñhira poses ‘unasked’ (ap(cid:8)ùña) further emphasises the
secretive and dangerous nature of the knowledge, and the necessity for
only appropriate people to know it; and in as much as Yudhiùñhira
knows to ask the question, this suggests he has enough insight into the
problems that provoke it, and the sophistication to deal with its impli-
cations.

For this dharma is more subtle than speech and wisdom, bull of Bhara-
tas. Having learned from and served with those of good conduct, at
some time23 one becomes good.
This verse continues the argument of 128.5, and foregrounds the com-
plex and problematic nature of the ensuing discussion of dharma. Just
as it is a ‘secret’, or a ‘mystery’, it is also ‘more subtle than speech or
wisdom’. The idea that dharma is subtle is found quite often in the
Mbh, usually in connection with the word s(cid:6)kùma.24 In this sense it is
often associated with moral dilemmas, and so is especially applicable
to realpolitisch contexts involving complex and competing moral de-
mands. The use of aõ(cid:5)yas emphasises not just the subtlety of this
dharma, but also its obscurity, the fact of its ‘mystery’: it is both diffi-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
23 N(cid:8)lakaõñha, on the other hand, provides the gloss kvacidde(cid:3)e for kvacid.
24 Cf. (cid:2)DhP 134.10. A useful collection of passages concerning s(cid:6)kùmadharma is
found in M. Hara, “A Note on dharmasya s(cid:6)kùm(cid:2) gatiþ,” in E. Franco and K. Preisen-
danz (eds), Beyond Orientalism: The Work of Wilhelm Halbfass and its Impact on
Indian and Cross-Cultural Studies, Amsterdam, Atlanta: Rodopi, 1997, pp.515-32.
Cf. also BDhS 1.1.12. The prominence of s(cid:6)kùmadharma in the Mbh has been recog-
nised at least as far back as Dahlmann, Das Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, e.g. pp.62-70.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 197
cult to talk about and difficult to learn, especially given the often rigid
dharmic prescriptions demanded at other times.25
If this obscure dharma confounds any secure foundation in lan-
guage or wisdom, how can it be ascertained? This problem, addressed
in the second hemistich of this verse, will be revisited on important
occasions in the (cid:2)DhP, most crucially perhaps in the Vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)mitra-
(cid:3)vapacasaüv(cid:2)da (12.139; SU 12). This hemistich points to a context
evoking the dharmam(cid:6)las, the epistemological sources of dharma re-
counted in the dharma literature.26 In citing the view that a person be-
comes good (s(cid:2)dhu) (implicitly entailing that such a person follows
dharma) by associating with those who follow ‘good conduct’ or
‘good customs’ (and, again implicitly, this speaks of people (espe-
cially br(cid:3)hmans) who have a thorough understanding of the Veda and
its traditions) this text suggests that dharma has its foundation in the
observed conduct of ‘good people’.27 Significantly, therefore, it im-
plies that dharma is not simply a collection of strict, textually bound,
moral injunctions. Furthermore, this places the br(cid:3)hman at the very
centre of the ascertainment of what is dharma, a frequent refrain in the
dharma literature and in the (cid:2)DhP.

Through action that has already been well thought-out one becomes
wealthy, or, on the other hand, one does not. A question such as this is

The first two padas of this obscure verse introduces what will shortly
concern much of this unit, even if its intent has more general signifi-
cance in this instance. The wealth of a kingdom, as it is often sug-
gested, provides a general indication of the kingdom’s health. These

25 Note that in the stories of Bal(cid:3)ka and Kau(cid:5)ika (Mbh 8.49), discussed in Hara’s
article (pp.516-19) cited in the previous note, K(cid:7)ùõa’s teaching on dharma, which
concerns s(cid:6)kùmadharma, is called dharmarahasya (8.49.25). In K(cid:7)ùõa’s summation of
the central message of these tales there are many parallels with 12.110 (compare
8.49.48-55 with 12.110.9-16). In an interesting case of intratextuality, Bal(cid:3)ka and
Kau(cid:5)ika are respectively cited in 12.110.6 and 8. In turn, 12.110 shares some thematic
connections with the (cid:2)DhP (see note 28 below).
26 On the dharmam(cid:6)las see above pp.115f. and below pp.276f.

two padas suggest that wealth in itself can be difficult to establish
even with the best laid plans (‘one might or might not be wealthy’). If
the prosperity of a kingdom is due in part to chance, then, already,
some of the moral grounds for expedient behaviour are laid down,
since the circumstances making necessary the kinds of questionable
behaviour (cid:2)paddharma often entails are not necessarily the result of
one’s own actions.
The last two padas offer another interesting characterisation of
Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na. By describing his question as anupra(cid:3)na, a
‘subsequent, supplementary, question’, Bh(cid:8)ùma indicates that it is
supplementary to the ‘regular’ r(cid:2)jadharma teachings of the RDhP.
This is not simply because it syntactically follows the RDhP, but also
because it should only be followed when other, preferred, forms of be-
haviour cannot be. Anupra(cid:3)na is used on two other similar occasions
in the (cid:6)P. Firstly, in RDhP 110.9—part of a section showing some
thematic similarity to the (cid:2)DhP—that concerns some of the difficult
dharmic implications of a king’s activity.28 The second is in the (cid:2)DhP
itself, when Bh(cid:8)ùma tells Yudhiùñhira in 136.12, ‘this subsequent ques-
tion is worthy of you’ (tvadyukto ’yam anupra(cid:3)no),29 before announc-
ing that he will speak about the ‘secret for crises’ (guhyam (cid:2)patsu).
These usages of anupra(cid:3)na, therefore, indicate contexts discussing the
problematic terrain of the balance between morality and expediency in
the affairs of a kingdom. The semantic component of ‘supplementar-
ity’ in the word is borne by the prefix anu-. This prefix has similar
implications in the word anukalpa, ‘supplementary rule’, which is of-
ten juxtaposed to a ‘primary rule’ (prathama kalpa), as in 128.24,
where the condition for living by the ‘supplementary rule’ (anu-
kalpena j(cid:5)vanam) is that one has already lived by the ‘primary rule’
(vahataþ prathamaü kalpam).30 The context makes clear that anu-
kalpa indicates rules for times of distress, while the primary rules are
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
28 Note that in 110 dharma is also considered ‘obscure’: 110.9 describes it as su-
durvaca, ‘very difficult to speak about’ (cf. 110.4) and ‘difficult to account for’ (duù-
karaþ pratisaükhy(cid:2)tum), and, in similarity with the present verse’s reference to (cid:2)dh(cid:5),
one resolves it (vyavasyati) through reason (tarkeõa). Fitzgerald (“Negotiating the
Shape,” pp.264-5; The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.149-52, 155-6) describes this section
as the “proto-(cid:2)paddharma” or “proto-(cid:4)paddharmaparvan”.
29 For similar constructions, if not always with quite the same sense, see Mbh
3.181.9; 5.156.8; 6.16.1; 9.62.7.

your primary rule; in times of distress there would then be another’. On anukalpa, see

those that operate in conventional times, and concern the v(cid:8)ttis and
dharmas which pertain to each varõa. As always, the concern is to
ensure that such ‘secondary rules’ for times of distress are exactly
that, only secondary. Later this is reflected again in (cid:2)DhP 159.15-16
(cf. MS 11.29-30): alternative ways of living are said to have been
established because of the ‘fear of death in times of distress’ ((cid:2)patsu
maraõ(cid:2)d bh(cid:5)tair), but ‘there is no reward in the next world’ (na
s(cid:2)üpar(cid:2)yikaü … vidyate phalam) for one ‘capable of the primary
rule’ (prabhuþ prathamakalpasya), who lives by the anukalpa.31

Listen to this stratagem that is abundant in law (dharma) and useful for
survival, Bh(cid:3)rata. I do not exalt this particular law (dharma) because of
merit (dharma). When misery comes to the wealthy here, then this
might be considered appropriate.
The demand to ‘listen’ in the second pada of this verse is characteris-
tic of a statement of intent (SI in FIGURE 8).32 The theme of the chap-
ter is introduced by Bh(cid:8)ma as a ‘strategy’ (up(cid:2)ya) ‘for the purpose of
survival’, which he further describes as ‘abundant in dharma’. This
striking juxtaposition of up(cid:2)ya and dharma is even more pronounced
in 128.13, where we find them compounded as up(cid:2)yadharma.33 The
idea of a dharma of ‘strategy’, a ‘strategic dharma’, or ‘an expedient
abundant in dharma’, is, in many ways, collateral with the idea of a
proper form of conduct (dharma) for a king in times of distress, since
a king must employ some form of strategy or policy to overcome dif-
ficulties that might arise for his kingdom. Indeed, in a n(cid:5)ti context,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
31 Cf. MS 3.147; and above p.48 n.34.
32 See also above p.183 for a discussion. Bh(cid:8)ùma repeats the request in 128.11.
33 Cf. 12.101.2 where it is found in the plural. In this case Yudhiùñhira asks about
kings ‘desiring victory’ (jay(cid:2)rthin) who lead their armies, ‘even having squeezed
dharma a little’ ((cid:5)ùad dharmaü prap(cid:5)óy(cid:2)pi). To which Bh(cid:8)ùma responds with a dis-
cussion of the strategic dharmas by which a king can pursue victory in conquest. The
precccupation is with n(cid:5)ti style policy, as illustrated in the remainder of the text which
concerns itself with means both ‘straight and crooked’ ((cid:8)jv(cid:5) vakr(cid:2) ca). The notion of
dharma, though largely absent for the majority of the text, is expressed in its frame in
Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na and Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial response (his ‘statement of intent’), and
reflected in Bh(cid:8)ùma’s curious choice of the expression ‘up(cid:2)yadharma’.
200 CHAPTER SIX
up(cid:2)yadharma could almost be regarded as a synonym for (cid:2)pad-
dharma. In the Mbh and the technical literature of the dharma- and
artha-(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, the word up(cid:2)ya often occurs in n(cid:5)ti contexts, where it
typically refers to the kinds of strategies a king uses to establish the
security of his kingdom and, frequently, to the more technical sense of
the ‘four strategies’, s(cid:2)ma (conciliation, sometimes s(cid:2)ntva), d(cid:2)na
(generosity), bheda (dissension) and daõóa (force).34 These political
strategies, as the following text (SU 2) makes clear, sometimes in-
volve behaviours measured more by their expedience than their merit
(dharma). The problem then becomes (as so often with Yudhiùñhira
and the Mbh) the relationship of such behaviour to dharma. The asso-
ciation of up(cid:2)ya with dharma, therefore, should be understood as part
of a wider effort to establish the dharmic, and therefore legitimate,
nature of these strategies, just as conduct in times of (cid:2)pad—which
necessarily stretches the boundaries of dharma—is legitimised by be-
ing called a ‘dharma’ (a meritorious, or appropriate form of conduct).
But, unlike the case in the dharma literature, where (cid:2)paddharma con-
cerns the needs of individuals, in the current context its application
directly affects the lives of other people and therefore involves dif-
ferent moral questions. The somewhat awkward nature of this dharma
is expressed in the next two padas, where Bh(cid:8)ùma clearly uses dharma
in two quite different ways. In the first case, dharma refers to the kind
of expedient conduct Bh(cid:8)ùma is about to teach as the ‘proper thing to
do’, that is, these (cid:2)pad- or up(cid:2)ya-dharmas. In the second case, he
paradoxically declares that he does not hold this dharma in high re-
gard ‘because of dharma’. Bh(cid:8)ùma does not esteem the law (dharma)
he is about to teach because it is meritorious in itself, but rather be-
cause it is expedient to do so, it gets the job done.

ticularly associated with the various (cid:2)pads enumerated in KA 9.5, 6 and 7 (see table
in FIGURE 6 above). The MS frequently uses this term in the technical sense of the
four up(cid:2)yas, though some prior knowledge of them seems assumed since it usually
refers to them collectively (e.g. 7.107-9, 159, 177, 214-15) and, unlike the KA, even
when it enumerates them (in 7.198-200) the treatment is far from thorough (see also
above pp.73f. and n.137 same page). Note also that two of the up(cid:2)yas are mentioned
in the pra(cid:3)na in (cid:2)DhP 128.4ab.

Only when all paths have been followed is there certainty. For whatever
teaching a man always beholds, accordingly he understands, and this
understanding pleases him. From misunderstanding, a man’s ineptitude
arises; on the other hand, his ineptitude arising from misunderstanding
could be the means that produces prosperity.
The last two padas of the previous verse (128.8ef) will be discussed
with the first two of 128.9, because they involve a similar conun-
drum,35 namely that the correct path, the path that produces the desired
outcome, cannot be predicted prior to the outcome of the action cho-
sen to attain it (cf. 128.7ab). The ends, therefore, justify the means.
This is part of a general strategy to counter the absolute authority at-
tributed to scripture, and a similar (partly in consequence of the first
point) fixed certainty in regard to dharma. In this way, a degree of
freedom in what is understood to be dharma is introduced which con-
sequently allows a greater inclusivity in what constitutes ‘proper be-
haviour’. This is especially telling in padas c through f in 128.9.
These four padas can be fruitfully compared to a similar verse at
MS 4.20. Though the similarity between them suggests the certainty
of their relationship,36 the differences in their meaning—a conse-
quence of their differing contexts and a slight variation in word-
ing—underscores the potential creativity of intertextual relationships
and places in relief the particular rhetorical drive of the passage in this
unit. MS 4.20 is as follows:
yath(cid:2) yath(cid:2) hi puruùaþ (cid:3)(cid:2)straü samadhigacchati|

For the more a man thoroughly acquires the learned teachings, the more
he understands, and his understanding shines forth.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
35 In Kinjawadekar’s edition of the “vulgate” (sometimes known as the “Bombay
edition”) the CE’s 128.8ef and 128.9ab are joined in the one (cid:3)loka (130.9), suggesting
a close semantic correlation, though his verse numbering can be highly idiosyncratic.
36 The shift in meaning between the MS and (cid:2)DhP passages strikes one as being
intentionally intertextual, and seems to gain its force viewed from the (cid:2)DhP back to
the MS, suggesting it may have been composed in the context of the MS passage. This
is reinforced by the transposition of MS 4.19c to RDhP 128.9d in place of MS 4.20b,
and the integration of MS 4.20 with its preceding stanza MS 4.19. This is difficult to
prove, however, and the two could just as well depend on a third (unknown) text (cf.
e.g. ViS 71.8).
202 CHAPTER SIX
The stanza occurs in a passage in the MS dealing with the proper v(cid:8)ttis
(occupations) and vratas (duties, observances) which together consti-
tute the dharma of the householder br(cid:3)hman (g(cid:8)hastha) who has re-
cently completed his studentship (i.e. the sn(cid:2)taka). The injunction nit-
yaü (cid:3)(cid:2)str(cid:2)õy avekùeta in MS 4.19c, ‘one should daily attend to the
teachings’ (which we find transposed into the indicative mode in
RDhP 128.9d) which ‘rapidly cause the increase of wisdom, bestow
wealth and are beneficial’ (buddhiv(cid:8)ddhikar(cid:2)õy (cid:2)(cid:3)u dhany(cid:2)ni ca hi-
t(cid:2)ni ca), and the ‘works which explain the Veda’ (nigam(cid:2)ü(cid:3) caiva
vaidik(cid:2)n). The phrase (cid:3)(cid:2)straü samadhigacchati in 4.20b seems to be a
gloss on 4.19c, and allows the whole statement to reinforce both the
epistemological certainty of the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras and the benefits that flow from
a proper understanding of them. It asserts an equation, that one’s un-
derstanding increases as a result of studying (cid:3)(cid:2)stras; the more one
studies the more one understands. The possibility of such understand-
ing is not subjected to any hermeneutic doubt: the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras have a
meaning, and the text gives no reason to doubt that it is ascertainable,
consistent and true.
On the other hand, as we have seen, the version in SU 1 has a quite
different context. Rather than making an equation of quantity, as in
MS 4.20, RDhP 128.9 appears to make an equation of quality; i.e., it
is the choice of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra that determines what one understands.37 The
claim does not destabilise the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras as effective sources of knowl-
edge, but rather questions their claims to consistency; it is not so much
that the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras do not have meaning and a valid function, but that
they say different things. This rests in part on understanding the rela-
tive-correlative constructions yath(cid:2) yath(cid:2) … tath(cid:2) tath(cid:2)… in subtly
different ways in the two versions. But this difference is supported by
each context. What in the MS is a phrase meant to reinforce the
fixidity of the interpretation of the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, and their consequent bene-
fits for every day life, becomes in SU 1 a phrase meant to suggest the
profound subjectivism of the hermeneutic process and, therefore, in-
troduces more fluidity in the understanding and application of the
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras and dharma. This is indicative of the (cid:2)DhP’s general ten-
dency to justify an interpretation of dharma that is less dependent on
scripture, thereby making possible an accomodation of expedient be-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
37 Cf. also Fitzgerald’s (The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7) translation and his notes to 128.9
on pp.757-8.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 203
haviour to dharma. The texts of the (cid:2)DhP frequently reinforce both
the multiplicity of (cid:3)(cid:2)stras and the flexibility of their understanding.
This apparent fluidity is further reinforced in 128.10, for not only is
the understanding of the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras not absolute, but even an improper
understanding may bring about success. Once again, it is the ends of
the adopted path that indicate its merit. The contextually geared inter-
pretation of each verse is reflected in the above translations of RDhP
128.9f and MS 4.20d, which, despite being identical, are capable of
being correctly interpreted on grammatical grounds in two quite dif-
ferent ways. The translation adopted for MS 4.20d above reflects a
transparent case of beneficence; that for RDhP 128.9f implies the self-
satisfaction of an ego-centric.38
Two further things should be noted about this passage. Firstly, in
MS 4.20 the subject of the verbs is a br(cid:3)hman (a sn(cid:2)taka), while in the
passage from SU 1 Bh(cid:8)ùma addresses himself to King Yudhiùñhira,
suggesting that he is in fact giving advice for a king to follow. This
transposition is not unusual for the (cid:2)DhP. A hermeneutic rule nor-
mally given for br(cid:3)hmans in their interpretation and application of
dharma, by which is meant ‘proper conduct’ in terms of one’s social
and ritual obligations as a member of a social class, is given in the
(cid:2)DhP for kings in their interpretation and application of dharma, by
which is meant ‘proper conduct’ in n(cid:5)ti, realpolitisch affairs, the final
justification of which is the survival of the kingdom and the social
order. Secondly, the use of cognates of vi+(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2) prefigures an impor-
tant epistemological argument in the (cid:2)DhP which constantly under-
lines the importance of judgement in the application of dharma,39 and
the pursuance of the proper strategy in the face of the numerous possi-
ble paths which present themselves. The prefix vi- is especially perti-
nent in this regard, because it implies a discriminating judgement,
which is critical given the argument for a more fluid understanding
and application of dharma that recurs through the (cid:2)DhP, and the sup-
posed ‘obscurity’ of the teachings of (cid:2)paddharma. One needs such
discriminating, perceptive judgement, in order to understand that its
realpolitisch concerns are dharma (i.e., are legitimate forms of behav-

iour) and in what sense they are dharma (i.e. the limits to their legiti-
macy).
To summarise the preceding, Bh(cid:8)ùma’s SI seems to be arguing, firstly,
that what is going to be taught is dharma (i.e. a legitimate form of be-
haviour), despite appearances and its dubious relationship to merit
(dharma). Secondly, that it is difficult to establish in absolute terms
what exactly dharma (law; legitimate behaviour) is. This leads, con-
sequently, to the third point, namely that this apparent fluidity opens
the door for the realpolitisch n(cid:5)ti concerns of the (cid:2)DhP to be consid-
ered in relation to dharma (law; merit), and hence ‘the right thing to
do’. In the remainder of this SU, Bh(cid:8)ùma elaborates the up(cid:2)yadharma
foregrounded in its opening stanzas. While economy demands a
briefer treatment than the above, I will outline what I consider to be
the most significant aspects.
6.1.3 The ko(cid:5)a
This unit consistently argues the following proposition, ‘this dharma
concerns the replenishment of the treasury (ko(cid:3)a) by any means
(up(cid:2)ya) necessary’. This argument takes up one of the themes men-
tioned in Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)nas (128.2c). The central position af-
forded the ko(cid:3)a follows from the principle that nothing is really possi-
ble—most especially the pursuance of dharma—without having a se-
cure kingdom at its foundation. All aspects of the kingdom are, in
turn, based upon a healthy source of funds in the form of the ko(cid:3)a.
This text constitutes a self-conscious attempt to present its realpoli-
tisch concerns in terms of dharma, thereby establishing their legiti-
mate foundations. In justifying its position, the text ranges from argu-
ing for the primacy of the ko(cid:3)a, to discussing the epistemological and
ontological nature of dharma. It illustrates its argument with a number
of striking analogies. Any deleterious consequences rebounding on the
individual (king) who employs such strategies are also anticipated and
dealt with.
It is both curious and significant that a specific strategy (up(cid:2)ya) is
not really described until 128.20, which openly poses the rhetorical
question: ‘when the means of living are obstructed, from whom can a
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 205
kùatriya not seize [wealth]?’40 (cid:2)DhP 128.26-7 contain similar state-
ments. Firstly, a king ‘should seize wealth from the better off, and
never be ruined’41 and, secondly, ‘… he who protects in accordance
with his nature as a kùatra should seize wealth’.42 These three state-
ments are some of the more specific indications that the concern of
this SU is the loosening of restrictions on the king that would nor-
mally apply, in order that he may build his treasury in a time of dis-
tress. The sparsity of its treatment of the specific means to be em-
ployed may indicate the difficult implications this subject holds. Ac-
cordingly, most of the chapter is concerned not so much to delineate
this strategy, but to justify it.
From 128.11 onwards Bh(cid:8)ùma makes his case for the fundamental
importance of the treasury, an importance which justifies the use of
any means (up(cid:2)ya) to safeguard it. In the process, he makes some on-
tological claims about the nature of dharma, claims which establish
the limits to the proper application of these means (up(cid:2)ya) even
though they have barely been outlined, thereby again anticipating their
problematic nature. In 128.11cd-12ab Bh(cid:8)ùma asserts that ‘from a de-
cline in the king’s treasury comes a decline in his power (or army)’,
and ‘a king should generate a treasury like water from desert’.43 A
number of subsequent statements set the parameters for the correct-
ness of this approach, as in 128.12cd, ‘when the right time comes he
should be kind; [but] this law (dharma) [i.e. the use of any means to
build the treasury] is now appropriate’, and 128.13cd, ‘there is one
law (dharma) for those of capacity, and another in times of distress
…’44 A similar structure is found in the next couple of stanzas as well.
Firstly, 128.14 makes a claim for the importance of the treasury, ‘law
(dharma) is said to have the treasury as its prerequisite’ (pr(cid:2)kko(cid:3)aþ
procyate dharmo), and then sets limits to the utility of dharma, ‘rea-
son is more important than law (dharma)’ (buddhir dharm(cid:2)d gar(cid:5)yas(cid:5))

a precedent for the current teachings. This is another important mode of justification.
206 CHAPTER SIX
for ‘a weak man who promotes the law (dharma) doesn’t find a le-
gitimate means of living’.45 And then stanza 128.15 sets the appropri-
ate grounds for the measures Bh(cid:8)ùma will teach to replenish the treas-
ury: ‘Since the production of wealth is not inevitable (ek(cid:2)ntena), then
when there’s a crisis what is not law (adharma) is also said to have the
mark of law (dharma).’46
These statements seek to demonstrate that politically expedient
conduct has a productive relationship to dharma, and indicate the
limitations of dharma conceived in (seemingly) strict moral terms. In
128.16 the kinds of doubt Yudhiùñhira typically expresses are directly
anticipated: ‘The sages know in what circumstance adharma is pro-
duced. You wonder if it’s inevitable (anantara) for a kùatriya.’47 The
next two stanzas (17-18) iterate that a king must establish his own
well-being in order to secure a foundation for the kingdom and
dharma, something he should do by any means (sarvop(cid:2)ya). The im-
portance of the treasury for providing this foundation, indicated al-
ready above, is frequently stated. In 128.31 with ‘rivers of wealth’
(dravyaughaiþ) a king is said to protect his kingdom (r(cid:2)ùñra) in a time
of distress. In 128.35 all aspects of society depend on the ko(cid:3)a: ‘The
treasury and the army are the foundation of the king. Moreover, the
army has its foundation in the treasury, all dharmas have the treasury
as their foundation, and the people have their foundation in dharma.’48
In the following stanza this becomes the justification for the oppres-
sion of others for the purposes of wealth.49 Importantly, in 128.43,
wealth is given further soteriological consequences, for through
wealth (dhanena) one conquers (jayate) ‘both worlds, this and the
next’ (lok(cid:2)v ubhau param imaü tath(cid:2)), furthermore, ‘true is this proc-
lamation on law (dharma), it (dharma) does not exist without

They say a king is weak without wealth; through wealth he will become
powerful. Everything is obtained through the possession of wealth; a
wealthy king overcomes everything; from wealth arise law (dharma)
and pleasure, this world and the next.
6.1.4 Justifications
A number of interesting analogies are used to justify this ‘strategy’ for
accumulating a treasury, and to indicate the extent to which the meas-
ures it entails can be pursued. We saw earlier that in times of distress
the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition relaxes the rules that impose restrictions on
the kinds of food a br(cid:3)hman can eat, and on the people for whom he
may offer sacrifices.51 In 128.21 this is used as an analogy to justify
the means described in 128.20 (see above p.204): a kùatriya (by which
we should understand especially the king) who seizes wealth in the
case of ‘hindrance to the means of living’ (v(cid:8)ttisaürodha) is just like a
br(cid:3)hman who sacrifices ‘for someone for whom he should not sacri-
fice’ (ayajya), and ‘eats food which he should not eat’ (abhojy(cid:2)nna),
i.e., in a time of distress. In 128.25 a very similar analogy is used to
justify the measures found in 128.26 (also see above p.204): one’s
livelihood (upaj(cid:5)vana) is gained through what is unlawful (any(cid:2)ya)
among dharmas (right forms of behaviour), ‘since this has been seen
among br(cid:3)hmans when their livelihood has disappeared’.52 In 128.40-
2, the necessity of sometimes killing while generating a treasury is
explained in terms of an analogy to the trees that stand in the way
(paripanthin) when the sacrificial post (y(cid:6)pa) is cut down: to reach the
chosen tree, ‘some surrounding trees also have to be cut down and,
while falling, they strike down other trees’.53 In the same way, men

glosses, ‘without wealth one is dead while living’ (j(cid:5)van m(cid:8)tatvam adhanasya).
51 In the context of his proper means of living (v(cid:8)tti). See GDhS 7.4; MS 10.103
(for sacrificing), 10.104-8 (for eating), see above p.39 n.10, p.47 n.29 and p.49 n.36.

208 CHAPTER SIX
who get in the way (nar(cid:2)þ paripanthinaþ) of a large treasury should
be killed (128.42). The necessity of killing is encountered already in
128.27-8, and this too is appeased by a similar analogy. In this case
the kùatriya is described as the ‘killer and protector’ (hant(cid:2)raü
rakùit(cid:2)raü ca) of the people, and hence the seizure of wealth is seen
as conduct which accords with his proper nature, which is then ame-
liorated through a general statement (128.28) on the inevitability of
violence: ‘other than through violence, in this world there is no means
of living for anyone, even for a sage …’54
These analogies are important indications of the hermeneutics of
dharma operating here. In order to make dharmic sense of political
expediency, the text employs the dominant paradigms of br(cid:3)hmaõic
ideology: the conduct of br(cid:3)hmans and sages themselves,55 and the
analogy of the sacrifice.56 This kind of politically expedient conduct is
dharma, ‘the proper thing to do’, because something similar is ob-
served among those who are the paradigms of dharma.57 In contrast,
when presenting similar measures neither the MS nor the KA show
any such concern to make sense of this conduct in terms of dharma. It
is presented simply as the necessary conduct that a king should em-
ploy as part of his responsibilities. This reflection on the relationship
of political expediency to dharma in the context of ‘(cid:2)paddharma’ is
by and large unique to the (cid:2)DhP.
6.1.5 The king’s duty (dharma)
Another interesting aspect of this text—one where the analogy to the
conduct of br(cid:3)hmans in times of distress seemingly breaks down—is
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
54 anyatra r(cid:2)jan hiüs(cid:2)y(cid:2) v(cid:8)ttir neh(cid:2)sti kasya cit| apy araõyasamutthasya ekasya
carato muneþ|| This is reinforced further in the following stanza. Similar remarks are
made by Arjuna in 12.15.21, see above p.142 n.26 and n.28.
55 The difficult 128.22ab could be understood in a similar sense if we accept Fitz-
gerald’s emendation, on good textual grounds, from the rarely attested nidh(cid:8)tasya to
nirv(cid:8)tasya (see Fitzgerald The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.758): p(cid:5)óitasya kim adv(cid:2)ram
utpatho nirv(cid:8)tasya v(cid:2)| ‘What would be the wrong door for one oppressed? What
would be the wrong path for one who is emancipated?’ Taken this way the analogy is
clear, as in both the ends justifies the means. On the other hand, if we emend ni-
dh(cid:8)tasya with vidh(cid:8)tasya, another common variant in northern manuscripts, padas a
and b would say much the same thing.
56 Cf. also 128.37-9. It is quite common for the value of something to be measured
against the sacrifice. See Olivelle, The (cid:4)(cid:3)rama System, p.54, and below p.216 n.86.
57 Cf. 128.14ab, discussed on p.205 n.44 above, in which a precedent is established
by ‘people in former times’ (p(cid:6)rvair … janaiþ).
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 209
that the measures it presents as (cid:2)paddharma do not shift the king’s
duties from his own proper varõa to another, as is the case with br(cid:3)h-
mans, but presents them as an extension of the king’s normal
dharma.58 In 128.27, which has been discussed already, a king’s duty
to seize wealth in times of distress is presented as a consequence of
him being the ‘killer and protector of the people’, that is, it is an ex-
treme aspect of his normal duty. Stanza 128.18 encourages the king to
use all means to save himself, because a weak man (sann(cid:2)tm(cid:2)) ac-
complishes nothing, 128.19 then reiterates that the duty of kùatriyas is
to use force:
tatra dharmavid(cid:2)ü t(cid:2)ta ni(cid:3)cayo dharmanaipuõe|
udyamo j(cid:5)vanaü kùatre b(cid:2)huv(cid:5)ry(cid:2)d iti (cid:3)rutiþ||
On this matter, among those who know the law (dharma), son, there is
certainty in their acute insight into the law (dharma). The sacred learn-
ing says, ‘for the kùatra, the means of living is exertion through the
strength of their arms’.59
To establish this as the king’s proper duty, this passage calls on two
familiar means of ascertaining dharma. Firstly, the position that ‘a
king should save himself by any means’ is law (dharma), is estab-
lished as a certainty60 through the proper understanding of dharma
among those who know it, the dharmavids. Secondly, it is established
by referral to the (cid:3)ruti, the sacred learning upon which all dharma, in
theory, is ultimately based.61 The duty thereby established with ‘cer-
tainty’ as proper dharma, via the only acceptable sources that can an-
swer such a question, really only amplifies the king’s normative
dharma, differing in no essential aspect other than the extent to which
force can be used. Stanzas 128.23ff. clearly raise this very issue.
Stanza 23, in particular, states that for a king who is ‘overthrown be-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
58 Cf. MS 10.118-19.
59 I take udyama and j(cid:5)vana in apposition here. I understand j(cid:5)vana to be a syno-
nym of v(cid:8)tti, i.e. the occupations an individual can pursue in accordance with his
dharma. Thus ‘exertion’ would mean the typical occupation prescribed for a kùatriya
(i.e. the king), bearing arms and protection (see e.g. MS 10.79-80 and above pp.44f.).
Fitzgerald (The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.492), on the other hand, understands these as
two separate terms: ‘There is exertion and survival in the kùatra, from the power of
their arms.’ The difference in translation does not, however, affect the argument.
60 Ni(cid:3)caya—which must refer to the position established in 128.18, iti ni(cid:3)caya.
61 Of course, we are unlikely to find such a statement in the (cid:3)ruti, though some-
thing similar no doubt could be found in other sm(cid:8)tis. Such a statement rests on the
theological position that the Veda (i.e. the (cid:3)ruti) provides the epistemological and
hermeneutic foundation of all dharma. See above p.115.
210 CHAPTER SIX
fore all his people through the depletion of his treasury and army’
(ko(cid:3)abalajy(cid:2)ny(cid:2) sarvalokapar(cid:2)bhavaþ) neither begging (bhaikùa-
cary(cid:2)), i.e. the livelihood of a br(cid:3)hman, nor the ‘livelihoods of a
vai(cid:5)ya or (cid:5)(cid:4)dra’ (viñ(cid:3)(cid:6)draj(cid:5)vik(cid:2)) are prescribed (vihit(cid:2)), which sug-
gests that there are few alternatives for a king besides his normal
dharma. This is reinforced in the next stanza, which demands that the
king pursue ‘whatever conduct is consistent with his own law so that
he never depends on others’.62 Throughout this SU, the frequent refer-
ence to the king’s legitimate use of force in replenishing the treasury
is seen as just another consequence of his duty to protect his kingdom
and subjects.63 In stanza 128.47 this is taken to its logical conclusion:
na ca r(cid:2)jyasamo dharmaþ ka(cid:3) cid asti paraütapa|
dharmaü (cid:3)aüsanti te r(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)m (cid:2)padartham ito ’nyath(cid:2)||
There is no law (dharma) of any kind equivalent to ruling, Paraütapa.
For times of distress, they commend a law (dharma) for kings different
from this.
Without the kingdom there is no dharma, and without a treasury there
is no kingdom. Thus the security and stability of the kingdom is
placed at the very centre of the horizon of dharma, and the mainte-
nance of its stability becomes equivalent to the fulfillment of
dharma.64 Therefore another, more problematic dharma, an (cid:2)pad-
dharma for kings, is recommended to remedy a kingdom’s declining
condition.
6.1.6 The king’s salvation
A further consequence of this general apologia of politically expedient
conduct in service of the kingdom’s stability, is that no deleterious
consequences of these actions recoil upon the king. In 128.36cd when
the king, for the purpose of a treasury, ‘oppresses others, he incurs no
sin’,65 and, in the next stanza, nor does he incur sin when he does what
‘should not be done’ (ak(cid:2)rya) during the sacrificial rites (yaj(cid:9)a-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

king fails to provide for his people, then (128.34):

6.2 ‘In praise of war’ (Mbh 12.129; SU 2)
This SU, the first chapter of the (cid:2)DhP proper, is quite short, consist-
ing of just fourteen stanzas. The text can be roughly divided into three
parts: Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)nas followed by two discussions by Bh(cid:8)ùma,
first on treaties (saüdhi) and then on war (yuddha). The two parts as-
signed to Bh(cid:8)ùma are further divided by an additional pra(cid:3)na from
Yudhiùñhira, providing some kind of structural coherence to the unit.
The pra(cid:3)nas which open the (cid:2)DhP have many similarities with those
in the previous SU, often showing either very close or exact verbal
similarity (129.1-3):68

67 This refers to the tale of King (cid:6)ibi found in Mbh 3.131. King (cid:6)ibi gives a hawk
his own flesh so that the hawk does not eat a dove that he is protecting. This tale con-
cerns both the responsibility of the king to provide for his subjects, the element
stressed here, and his duty towards those who come to him for protection. See also
Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.758.
68 Compare e.g. 128.2b (cid:3) 129.2b; 128.3cd = 129.3cd.
69 Belvalkar gives srutamantrasya for this in the CE. But Fitzgerald (The Mah(cid:2)-
bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.758-9) points out that for this and the parallel in 128.2 the reading
(cid:3)rutamantrasya is clearly better attested. Of course, the meaning hardly varies.
212 CHAPTER SIX
armies which are powerful while he is weak, and when his mind is af-
flicted, speak! What remains to be done?
Taken together, the above pra(cid:3)nas and those that opened RDhP 128
give a broad description in political terms of a time of distress. Fur-
thermore, I consider that the pra(cid:3)nas beginning this unit, and those
beginning SUs 1 and 3 (130), provide a framework broader than sim-
ply the SUs that contain them. That is to say, their capacity as frames
extends further than simply SU’s 1, 2 or 3 respectively. I will return to
this argument at the relevant times.
Unlike SU 1, Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response to Yudhiùñhira’s questioning does
not place this set of problems within a dharmic frame, rather he at-
tends to the means of extricating the king from the situations the
pra(cid:3)nas describe. The similarities with the KA in both expression and
suggested procedure are striking. This is evident in the first two verses
(129.4-5), which speak of two different types of vijig(cid:5)ùu, the king who
‘desires to conquer’, the figure conceived as the very centre of the
Kauñilyan maõóala theory.70 In this case, the concern is for the honest
((cid:3)uci) vijig(cid:5)ùu ‘competent in policy and law’ (dharm(cid:2)rthaku(cid:3)ala) in
129.4, and the powerful (balav(cid:2)n) adharmic vijig(cid:5)ùu who is ‘intent
upon evil’ (p(cid:2)pani(cid:3)cayaþ) in 129.5. This taxonomy recalls others
found in n(cid:5)ti literature. The KA speaks of ‘dharmic, greedy and de-
monic conquerors’ in 12.1.10ff. (dharmalobh(cid:2)suravijayin), with rec-
ommendations on different ways of dealing with them, and similarly
RDhP 59.38-9 discusses demonic ((cid:2)sura) victory, and victory (vijaya)
linked to dharma (dharmayukta) and wealth (arthayukta).71
The (cid:2)DhP deals with the first kind of conqueror in just one verse
(129.4). A king ‘should quickly make peace with him, making him
give up those prior concerns’ (javena saüdhiü kurv(cid:5)ta p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n
vimokùayan). The main difficulty here is to understand precisely what
is referred to by p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n. The doubling of p(cid:6)rva with the same
declension occurs quite commonly in (cid:5)(cid:3)stric literature, in which case
it typically follows or refers to a list or an enumeration of some kind,
and indicates the relative merit of each member of that list. In such
cases it is usually accompanied by a comparative,72 though there are
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
70 See above p.72 n.131 and p.76 n.151.
71 Cf. RDhP 81.5 which refers to conquerers who act with dharma or adharma
(dharm(cid:2)dharmeõa r(cid:2)j(cid:2)na(cid:3) caranti vijig(cid:5)ùavaþ).
72 E.g. (cid:2)DhS 1.1.4-5, 1.1.8, 2.12.3; GDhS 7.5; BDhS 1.20.10; VDhS 13.57, 17.79;
MS 7.52, 9.295; KA 8.1.5; 9.2.13, 21, 5.32, 6.57, 7.21, 61, 63; Mbh 12.35.6, 101.17.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 213
some exceptions in which the element of comparison is only implied,
indicating that each earlier member of the list is more important or
significant than the later.73 The problem in the present case is that it is
not clear if there is a list to which p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n should refer. If
p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n must have a clear textual referent (usually antece-
dent)—and if not this would be the only such construction I have
found which does not—and this referent cannot be established, then
this may indicate the composite nature of the text or its corruption in
the process of transmission.
Scharfe, recognising that p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n ought to have an antece-
dent or referent, has suggested that it refers to 128.32, which lists the
treasury (ko(cid:3)a), army (daõóa), power (bala), allies (mitra) and ‘other
accumulated things’ (anyad api saücitam).74 In favour of this proposi-
tion the order of priority in 128.32 accords with the general priority of
the state constituents presented in other contexts (with the addition,
however, of bala, often a synonym for daõóa, ‘army’). Counting
against it, however, is the sheer distance between p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n and
its antecedent, since, as other instances of the doubled p(cid:6)rva suggest,
a much closer syntactic relationship is to be expected. Yet if Scharfe is
perhaps stretching the bow a little too far in connecting p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n
to the list in 128.32, he is perhaps on the right track in pointing to-
wards the ‘state constituents’—that is, what are commonly referred to
in the KA as the prak(cid:8)tis75—as the referents for p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n. It is
also tempting to conclude this on the grounds that the pra(cid:3)nas intro-
ducing this text clearly presuppose a similar taxonomy of state con-
stituents.76 However, it is unlikely that p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n can refer di-
rectly to the various constituents found or implied in these pra(cid:3)nas,
since, if p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)n indicates the priority of each preceding mem-
ber listed—as it seems it must from other similar constructions—the
order given in the pra(cid:3)nas does not follow that generally given in lists
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
73 E.g. (cid:2)DhS 2.11.10; GDhS 2.38, 28.11; MS 2.184, 10.114; KA 9.7.46-7, 10.6.44.
74 The State, p.202 n.6.
75 See above p.52 n.46 and p.65.
76 Thus, for example, 129.1ab might refer to the king (i.e. sv(cid:2)mi in the prak(cid:8)ti
lists), paura might be analgous to pura (in MS—note also the common variant pura
for paura) or janapada (in KA), r(cid:2)ùñra is found in MS (for durga in KA), nir-
dravyanicayasya refers to the state of the treasury, ministers (am(cid:2)tya) are mentioned
in 129.2d and implied in 129.2ab, allies are mentioned in 129.2c, and finally the army
is implied in 129.3ab. Note also that the KA speaks of the viraktaprak(cid:8)ti, ‘the disaf-
fected constituents (or subjects)’, see 6.1.13, 2.38; 7.5.9, 27, 29ff.
214 CHAPTER SIX
of the state constituents. Nonetheless, stronger evidence that it is in
fact the prak(cid:8)tis that are being implied here can be inferred by a strik-
ing parallel to the current stanza in KA 9.7.46, in the prakaraõa con-
cerning the overcoming of dangers ((cid:2)pad) in ‘connection to advan-
tage, disadvantage and uncertainty’ (arth(cid:2)narthasaü(cid:3)aya).77 After
explaining the various configurations of these three characteristics in
respect to the king and his enemy, this passage continues:
tasy(cid:2)ü p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)ü p(cid:6)rv(cid:2)ü prak(cid:8)t(cid:5)n(cid:2)m anarthasaü(cid:3)ay(cid:2)n mokùayituü
yateta|
On this, he should try to set free the constituents of the state, each ear-
lier one first, because of doubts in respect to disadvantage.
The prak(cid:8)tis referred to in this passage are then spelled out in sum-
mary form and appropriate order in KA 9.7.47. The verbal and seman-
tic parallels between this and the (cid:2)DhP stanza are suggestive of some
kind of relationship between the two texts, and it might perhaps be
surmised that the n(cid:5)ti framework of the (cid:2)DhP was so well known that
it was enough to imply the prak(cid:8)tis in the context of 129.4. Whatever
the case may be, the dharmic conqueror does not cause much conster-
nation.78 The general sense is clearly that after making a treaty a king
should set about extracting all his prior assets, given up in the cause of
combat or treaty negotiations, from their state of subjugation. This is
clearly the sense in the variant p(cid:6)rvabhukta, ‘what has previously
been conquered’, given in Kinjawadekar’s edition of the Mbh.79
The adharmic conqueror is another beast altogether, and the verses
between 129.5-9 are concerned primarily with the problems he poses.
While in this case too a king should sue the enemy for peace, with the
circumstances and the conqueror being more extreme than in the pre-
vious example, the king must extricate himself through (cid:2)tmanaþ
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
77 See above table in FIGURE 6, p.60.
78 Similarly, KA 12.1.1 says the ‘dharmic conqueror is satisfied with submission’
(abhyavapatty(cid:2) dharmavijay(cid:5) tuùyati), not with the conquest of resources.
79 This reading is not recorded in the critical notes to the CE, though Belvalkar
does cite in a note to this verse. N(cid:8)lakaõñha glosses p(cid:6)rvabh(cid:6)kta with: sv(cid:5)yap(cid:6)rvair
bhukt(cid:2)n gr(cid:2)managar(cid:2)d(cid:5)n ten(cid:2)kr(cid:2)nt(cid:2)n krama(cid:3)aþ tato mocayet s(cid:2)mna … ‘Then
through conciliation one should gradually free one’s own previously conquered
towns, cities and so on that are in his possession …’ Fitzgerald translates the CE read-
ing ‘any areas already conquered’, but makes no further comment. The commentator
V(cid:3)dir(cid:3)ja, cited in the CE’s critical notes, glosses the variant p(cid:6)rvaü p(cid:6)rvaü with
jitaü jitaü. Scharfe seems to miss the intent of vimokùayan, taking it to mean ‘surren-
der’ (The State, p.202 n.6).
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 215
saünirodhena, the ‘restraint of himself’ (i.e restraining himself from
immediately attacking the ‘adharmic conqueror’). The meaning of
this, as the following verses explain, is that above all the king should
save himself, since it is only ‘while living that a king may regain his
possessions’.80 Even if there are some ‘disasters ((cid:2)pad) that can be
overcome only through abandonment’,81 it would be pointless for a
king to give up his life.82
The first aim of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response to Yudhiùñhira is to outline the
grounds and uses of treaties. Following a second pra(cid:3)na from
Yudhiùñhira, however, the last 4 verses of the chapter concern the
proper pursuance of war, hence the title of the adhy(cid:2)ya given in some
manuscript colophons. I have previously described this pra(cid:3)na as a
‘request for clarification’ (RC in the table in FIGURE 8), since it reiter-
ates his opening pra(cid:3)na. This reiteration may be due to Bh(cid:8)ùma so far
only offering a remedy for the king’s survival rather than for the resto-
ration of the king and his kingdom. But the pra(cid:3)na also serves a struc-
tural function, since it is apparent that it occurs at a natural division in
the discussion between a section concerning treaties and survival and
a section concerning war. The language used in this question
(129.9ab) is worth noting, (cid:2)bhyantare prakupite b(cid:2)hye copanip(cid:5)óite
‘when there is revolt internally, and one is oppressed externally …’,
since it is characteristic of the KA’s treatment of the topic of calami-
ties or dangers, and speaks to the basic n(cid:5)ti dichotomy between the
internal and external affairs of the kingdom.83 As is typical of
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s replies, he does not answer in specific terms the issues
raised in Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na. Rather the pra(cid:3)na frames a general

82 Cf. KA 12.1.15-16, which says that the asura conqueror is only satisfied ‘with
the seizure of land, wealth, sons, wives and life’, (bh(cid:6)midravyaputrad(cid:2)rapr(cid:2)õa-
haraõena), and that the king ‘should take counter measures though giving him land
and goods, and not be captured himself’ (taü bh(cid:6)midravy(cid:2)bhy(cid:2)m upag(cid:8)hy(cid:2)gr(cid:2)hyaþ
pratikurv(cid:5)ta). It is not uncommon for other (cid:3)(cid:2)stras to insist that the king save himself,
and we find it stated in other places in the (cid:2)DhP and wider Mbh, e.g. MS 7.212-13;
Mbh 5.37.17; (cid:2)DhP 136.171, 173; KA 12.1.32. See also Sternbach, “Quotations …
I,” pp.515-16; Malamoud, “On the Rhetoric and Semantics,” pp.33f.; and above p.77
n.156. On treaties in general see also KA 7.3.22-36, which contains quite a detailed
taxonomy.
83 See, e.g. KA 8.2.2-3; 9.3 (esp. 9-14), and the chapter on ‘conspiracies’ 9.5. (See
above FIGURE 6.) The word for revolt is kopa. See also Scharfe, The State, pp.66ff. Cf.
RDhP 82.13 in which N(cid:3)rada tells K(cid:7)ùõa about ‘two types of calamities, internal and
external’ ((cid:2)pado dvividh(cid:2)þ k(cid:8)ùõa b(cid:2)hy(cid:2)(cid:3) c(cid:2)bhyantar(cid:2)(cid:3) ca …).
216 CHAPTER SIX
situation of crisis to which Bh(cid:8)ùma responds with a generalised rem-
edy. This response clearly follows from the discussion of treaties, and
explains the reason why the king must seek to always save himself:
‘quickly removing any sign of himself, in the meantime he should
prepare for war’ (pad(cid:2)panayaü kùipram et(cid:2)vat s(cid:2)üpar(cid:2)yikam).84 For
a king conquers the whole world ‘even with a small army’ (alpen(cid:2)pi
hi sainyena) if it is well nourished.85 The pursuance of war for a king
or kùatriya is justified in a manner typical of Indian texts, and espe-
cially of the bhakti infused heroic ethos of the Mbh (most famously in
the BhG). Thus if the king dies in battle he goes to heaven, otherwise
he wins the whole earth.86 The unit concludes with a number of brief
statements on how the king should behave if he gains the kingdom
(129.13), and finally Bh(cid:8)ùma returns once again to the theme of con-
ciliation, but this time in the case where the king decides to retreat
from battle (apakramitum). The unit is somewhat unusual in not hav-
ing a clear concluding statement.
6.3 ‘The conduct of a royal sage’ (Mbh 12.130; SU 3)
In contrast with the two previous units, the pra(cid:3)na beginning chapter
130 (SU 3) asks the kind of question that brings us directly within the
horizon of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition: how should a br(cid:3)hman live in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
84 129.10.
85 129.11. Cf. RDhP 95.4 which says the same thing (95.4cd and 129.11cd are
variations of each other). This position is contradicted by Kauñilya. In KA 12.1.8 he
says, ‘fighting with a small army, one sinks as if plunging into the ocean without a
boat’ (yudhyam(cid:2)na(cid:3) c(cid:2)lpasainyaþ samudram iv(cid:2)plavo ’vag(cid:2)ham(cid:2)naþ s(cid:5)dati). This is
in response to Vi(cid:5)(cid:3)l(cid:3)kùa (12.1.3-5) who recommends fighting whether one wins or
loses, because it is the kùatriya’s svadharma. Despite this apparent difference, Kau-
ñilya is not far from what Bh(cid:8)ùma recommends. He first argues against both submis-
sion and battle against the odds, and then argues, with some subtlety, for various
strategies that make use of both submission and battle in more surreptitious ways. See
above p.76 and n.149.
86 129.12ab hato v(cid:2) divam (cid:2)rohed vijay(cid:5) kùitim (cid:2)vaset| 12cd has a similar idea, the
dead warrior winning the world of (cid:6)akra. Cf. MS 7.88-9, KA 10.3.30, 43 (see also
KA 3.1.41), Mbh 2.11.63, 20.14-16; 5.133.11ff.; 6.17.8-11 and especially the parallel
6.24.37 (BhG) hato v(cid:2) pr(cid:2)psyasi svargaü jitv(cid:2) v(cid:2) bhokùyase mah(cid:5)m| This resonates
particularly with the idea of the ‘sacrifice of battle’ (raõayaj(cid:9)a), e.g. Mbh 5.57.10-15,
139.29, 154.4; 12.99.13, cf. also (cid:2)DhS 2.26.2-3; MS 5.98. On all this, see Scharfe,

Violence and the Rationalization of Violence in South Asian Cultural History, Leiden:

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 217
times of (cid:2)pad? However, in keeping once again with the (cid:2)DhP’s par-
ticular focus on the king, the concern is not so much with what br(cid:3)h-
mans might do in such a time, a topic dealt with only in the barest
manner, but with how the king should treat his br(cid:3)hman subjects.
Taken together, the last chapter of the RDhP and the opening two
chapters of the (cid:2)DhP provide a comprehensive picture of the king’s
role in a time of (cid:2)pad: firstly, from the perspective of reversing a de-
cline in the kingdom’s fortunes; and, secondly, from the perspective of
how the king should behave towards his paradigmatic subjects—the
br(cid:3)hmans—when, as a consequence of the kingdom’s decline in for-
tunes, they act in the interests of self-preservation rather than in ac-
cord with the normal rules of dharma.87 These three chapters are espe-
cially important because they delineate the topic as it is treated in
many of the following chapters of the parvan, especially up until
12.141 (SU 14), when there is a shift in focus. In particular, units 4
through 8, which do not have pra(cid:3)nas, seem in many ways to return to
the themes outlined in these opening pra(cid:3)nas.
We begin again with Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na (130.1-2):
h(cid:5)ne paramake dharme sarvalok(cid:2)tilaïghini|
sarvasmin dasyus(cid:2)d bh(cid:6)te p(cid:8)thivy(cid:2)m upaj(cid:5)vane||
ken(cid:2)smin br(cid:2)hmaõo j(cid:5)vej jaghanye k(cid:2)la (cid:2)gate|
asaütyajan putrapautr(cid:2)n anukro(cid:3)(cid:2)t pit(cid:2)maha||
When the highest law (dharma) has been neglected, when all people are
transgressing, when all livelihoods on earth have become those of ban-
dits, when the lowest time has arrived, how can a br(cid:3)hman live while
not abandoning his sons and grandsons due to his compassion, grandfa-
ther?
This represents an important characterisation of the problem of (cid:2)pad
in terms of the dharma of the individual, that is to say, in terms of his
proper social duties. What types of conduct are acceptable for the
br(cid:3)hman given his normal duties have become difficult to perform?
Some of the key motifs in this description are explicitly revisited later
in SUs 12 and 13 ((cid:2)DhP 139-40), but are also raised in other units
too. The degrading of livelihoods into those of bandits88 is indicative
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
87 The (cid:2)DhP only concerns itself with the other two classes (vai(cid:5)yas and (cid:5)(cid:4)dras) of
the classical varõa system from the point of view of utility.
88 Cf. RDhP 68.20 which says that without the king’s protection ‘this world would
become that of bandits’ (loko ’yam dasyus(cid:2)d bhavet). Similar fears are expressed in
12.74.10 and 329.12, and in terms of the distinct but related notion of the mleccha,
(cid:3)
218 CHAPTER SIX
of both social degradation and an equivalent degradation of the indi-
vidual. Typically it is seen as a principal duty of a king to keep such
forces at bay (on which we shall have more to say in subsequent sec-
tions).89 Indeed, the (cid:2)DhP returns quite often to the problem of the
relationship of the ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ of br(cid:3)hmaõic socio-cultural
institutions, and it frequently expresses this through the mediation of
dasyus, ‘bandits’, or other outsiders and ‘low-born’ people.90 This is
so for two reasons. First, because any threat to dharma, the idea of
proper conduct as it pertains especially to varõa—perhaps the most
important concept in the self-understanding of br(cid:3)hmaõic culture—is
especially heightened in a time of (cid:2)pad, since it is precisely then that
dharma is difficult to uphold and the ‘outside’ begins to impede on the
‘inside’, threatening the integrity of the whole system. Second, be-
cause ‘bandits’ and other cultural ‘outsiders’ living on the fringes of
the br(cid:3)hmaõic socio-cultural universe become, in a ‘dangerous’ cul-
tural inversion, exemplars for how to survive in difficult times; their
livelihoods based on criminal ‘marauding’ activities, or on ‘low caste’
occupations like hunting, serve as models for both kings and br(cid:3)h-
mans when times demand it. The very concept of (cid:2)paddharma, there-
fore, brings into relief some of the central concerns of br(cid:3)hmaõic cul-
tural identity. By adopting the behaviour and culture of an ‘other’
(whether another varõa, or one outside of the varõa scheme, i.e. a
dasyu), one may even become this other. This fear of degradation is
further linked to another common motif of (cid:2)paddharma, the degrada-
tion of time, expressed in the phrase jaghanye k(cid:2)la (cid:2)gate, which per-
haps paraphrases kaliyuga, the lowest of the four ages. Together with
the transition periods between the ages (yugas), this is the most typical
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
‘barbarian’, in 3.188.29, 37, 45 (see also J. Brockington, “Concepts of race in the
Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata and R(cid:3)m(cid:3)yaõa,” in P. Robb, (ed.), The Concept of Race in South Asia,
Delhi: OUP, 1995, p.106). Cf. also Pata(cid:9)jali’s view (introduction to the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)ùya)
that one studies Sanskrit grammar in order not to become a mleccha; and the view
expressed in (cid:6)B 3.1.2.23f. that by using a mleccha language one risks becoming mlec-
cha (both of which are noted by Halbfass, India and Europe, pp.178f.; cf. M.
Deshpande, “What to do with the An(cid:2)ryas? Dharmic discourses of inclusion and ex-
clusion,” in J. Bronkhorst and M. Deshpande (eds), Aryan and non-Aryan in South
Asia: Evidence, Interpretation and Ideology, Cambridge: Department of Sanskrit and
Indian Studies, Harvard University, 1999, p.109). We have already seen (above p.46)
that one of the principal dangers (cid:2)paddharma attempts to avoid is ‘becoming the same
as one who is from a varõa other than one’s own’.

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 219
‘mythic’ characterisation of a time of (cid:2)pad, a characterisation that we
shall also come across again in later units.91
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response to Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na goes about justifying a
br(cid:3)hman’s adoption of a lifestyle outside of the norm, and how a king
should recognise and behave towards such a br(cid:3)hman. In setting out
his argument, in 130.3 Bh(cid:8)ùma introduces the central concept of
vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala, the ‘power of discriminating judgement’, by which a
br(cid:3)hman in such a situation should live. This concept refers to learned
br(cid:3)hmans’ ability to discern the proper application of dharma in re-
spect of the limitations of circumstances.92 It would seem to clearly
grow out of conceptions of the (cid:3)iùña—the learned br(cid:3)hman whose be-
haviour is the measure of what is good (sat, s(cid:2)dhu) and what is
dharmic—which are found in the dharma literature.93
After introducing the concept of vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala, Bh(cid:8)ùma grounds the
argument on the view that it is primarily for the ‘good’ that the king
must accumulate wealth (130.3cd-5),94 and the ‘good’ refers especially
to those learned br(cid:3)hmans who are the touchstone of dharma; the king
must hold as one of his principal concerns the maintenance of their
livelihoods. We might imagine that the problem then is to recognise
those who are good and those who are not. This chapter, however,
barely deals with this. Rather it is chiefly concerned with the privi-
leged status of the br(cid:3)hman, conferred on him by the special re-
lationship to dharma that his vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala (and presumably other re-
lated factors, such as his knowledge of the Veda) affords him. Thus
130.6:
vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabalap(cid:6)to yo vartate ninditeùv api|
v(cid:8)ttavij(cid:9)(cid:2)nav(cid:2)n dh(cid:5)raþ kas taü kiü vaktum arhati||
Who can say anything about him who is resolute and endowed with the
ability to discriminate between proper modes of living, even if he lives
among the despicable, purified as he is by the power of his discriminat-
ing judgement?
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
91 See discussions of SUs 11 and 12. Cf. Biardeau, Études—bhakti et avat(cid:2)ra,
p.39: “… the clever counsels of K(cid:7)ùõa, the lying of Yudhiùñhira which allowed the
death of Droõa, all this is justified undoubtedly by the time of distress—(cid:2)pad—that
constitutes the war, but maybe also by the Kaliyuga which the war or some other
event would introduce.”
92 Cf. also Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.759.
93 See above p.97 and n.66, p.116 and n.145.
94 A similar phrase to 130.4 occurs in MS 11.19, and it is repeated again in (cid:2)DhP
134.7.
220 CHAPTER SIX
This ability separates the br(cid:3)hman from the ordinary man (130.8):
yad eva prak(cid:8)taü (cid:3)(cid:2)stram avi(cid:3)eùeõa vindati|
tad eva madhy(cid:2)þ sevante medh(cid:2)v(cid:5) c(cid:2)py athottaram||
Middling people follow whatever proffered teaching is found without
disinction; the learned man, however, follows something higher.
The ‘something higher’ (uttara) is vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala, the ability of the
learned to discriminate between teachings ((cid:3)(cid:2)stras). This speaks once
again to a theme we find recurring in the (cid:2)DhP, that the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras are
not just one fixed, amorphous whole with one meaning for all people
and for all time;95 rather, their application requires judgement and
choice, the finely tuned application of scripture to practice—or justifi-
cation of practice through scripture—that only the learned man can
manage. It is because of the br(cid:3)hman’s inviolable status and his spe-
cial insight into what constitutes proper behaviour that the king is told
in 130.9 ‘not to rebuke sacrificial priests, family priests, teachers and
br(cid:3)hmans’ ((cid:8)tvikpurohit(cid:2)c(cid:2)ry(cid:2)n … na br(cid:2)hmaõ(cid:2)n y(cid:2)tayeta). This is
followed by an ambiguous stanza which declares etat pram(cid:2)õam,
‘they are the standard’, or, if we take the pronoun to refer to the prin-
ciple expressed in 9, ‘this [i.e. the inviolability of br(cid:3)hmans etc.] is the
standard’.96 The former seems more likely, since in the following
padas this ‘standard’ (pram(cid:2)õa) is said to be that by which the s(cid:2)dhu
‘good’ and the as(cid:2)dhu ‘bad’ are measured (130.10d tena tat s(cid:2)dhv
as(cid:2)dhu v(cid:2)), which recalls the notion found in the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradi-
tion that locates the ‘good’ in the behaviour of properly learned men
(i.e. those learned in the Veda). We could not be far wrong in as-
suming that this means such people as the (cid:8)tivij, purohita, (cid:2)c(cid:2)rya and,
of course, br(cid:2)hmaõa, as referred to by this text.97
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
95 I agree with Fitzgerald (op. cit., p.759) that the distinction operating here is be-
tween rules that should ordinarily govern behaviour and those applied in special cir-
cumstances, as the dramatisation of this teaching in 12.139 supports. N(cid:8)lakaõñha, on
the other hand, takes this quite differently, but seems to miss the sense in glossing the
variant pr(cid:2)k(cid:8)tam (in Kinjawadekar’s edition) for prak(cid:8)ta with pr(cid:2)k(cid:8)t(cid:2)paddharmopa-
yogi (cid:3)(cid:2)stram, ‘a teaching applying a vulgar (cid:2)paddharma’.
96 See Fitzgerald, op. cit., p.759.
97 This would be Hacker’s ‘empirical basis of dharma’, see above p.114 (for criti-
cisms of this terminology see n.135 same page). Cf. also MS 11.84, which, in a pas-
sage concerned in part with the br(cid:3)hman’s relationship to dharma, says, ‘he alone is
the standard of the world, for the Veda is the basis on this matter’ (pram(cid:2)õaü caiva
lokasya brahm(cid:2)traiva hi k(cid:2)raõam).
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 221
Whatever the precise sense, the privileged position of the learned
br(cid:3)hman is without question. Emphasising this, the following three
stanzas encourage the king not to listen to the gossiping of villagers,
who apparently disapprove (presumably, through their ignorance) of
the behaviour of br(cid:3)hmans who are living according to a principle like
vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala. The apparently ‘empirical’ sense of the ‘good’ (and, by
implication, dharma) suggested by 130.10—that it is what is observed
amongst the ‘good’—is affirmed in 130.15, ‘some think conduct alone
is the most important indication of dharma’ ((cid:2)c(cid:2)ram eva manyante
gar(cid:5)yo dharmalakùaõam), a view contrasted with that of those ‘enam-
oured with (cid:6)aïkha and Likhita’ ((cid:3)aïkhalikhitapriya), a reference indi-
cating the unwavering maintenance of a strict moral code.98 In fact,
this and the next two somewhat difficult stanzas appear to turn such
peoples’ apparent commitment to these values on its head. Those ‘en-
amoured with (cid:6)aïkha and Likhita’ are accused of holding their views
due to their ‘softness’ (m(cid:2)rdav(cid:2)d) and greed (15ef). They recommend
the ‘expulsion of evil-doers’ (vikarmasthasya y(cid:2)panam),99 a standard
that only applies to sages,100 and then are apparently charged with rec-
ommending this because they themselves covet the wealth of those
who are thereby expelled (130.17cd).
If it is correct to say that the principal ‘lesson’ of this unit is that
the king must by and large leave br(cid:3)hmans to their own devices when
it comes to dharma (the limits to which are never really explored), it is
also worth considering if the actual application of a concept like vi-
j(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala—and a freer understanding of the application of the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras
in order to understand a particular behaviour as a form of dharma—is
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
98 Vy(cid:3)sa tells the story of the strict ascetics and brothers (cid:6)aïkha and Likhita in
Mbh 12.24 by way of explaining to Yudhiùñhira the importance of the king adminis-
tering punishment. After visiting his brother’s hermitage but finding him not there,
Likhita helps himself to a piece of fruit from a tree. Upon returning, (cid:6)aïkha is furious
to see Likhita eating the fruit and, accusing him of theft, demands that he take himself
before the king for punishment. Likhita does so and the king, reluctantly at first, has
his hands cut off at Likhita’s own insistence. Upon Likhita returning to his brother,
(cid:6)aïkha restores his hands. (See also Kane, HDh(cid:7) vol.1, footnote on p.136.) (cid:6)aïkha
and Likhita are cited in a similar vein at RDhP 116.21, and again in 128.29, where the
principle they personify is contrasted with the life a king must lead in order to protect
his subjects.

meant for the king as well. In the concluding stanza (CS) of this unit
Bh(cid:8)ùma says (130.21):
evaü sadbhir vin(cid:5)tena path(cid:2) gantavyam acyuta|
r(cid:2)jarù(cid:5)õ(cid:2)ü v(cid:8)ttam etad avagaccha yudhiùñhira||
In this way, unshakeable man, one should go by the path that has been
tamed by the good; Yudhiùñhira, you should understand this as the con-
duct of royal sages.
Are we meant to understand that this only applies to the king’s treat-
ment of br(cid:3)hmans? Or is he meant to emulate them as well in their
application of dharma, in their skill in understanding the relationship
of scripture to exigency?101 When this passage beseeches him to fol-
low the lead of the good (sat), does this mean he should adopt the
principles they apply in respect to dharma (like e.g. vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala)? Or
is this simply a call to proper behaviour without any such subtle im-
plications? This issue is encountered in an earlier stanza when Bh(cid:8)ùma
again attests to the foundation of dharma in the observed behaviour of
particular people (130.18):
sarvataþ satk(cid:8)taþ sadbhir bh(cid:6)tiprabhavak(cid:2)raõaiþ|
h(cid:8)dayen(cid:2)bhyanuj(cid:9)(cid:2)to yo dharmas taü vyavasyati||
He takes for dharma that which is properly done by good people every-
where, people who bring about the growth of prosperity, and what is
sanctioned by his [or their] heart[s].
A crucial problem in this stanza concerns the agent of the passive verb
abhyanuj(cid:9)(cid:2)ta. Should it be the king, who seems to be the subject of
vyavasyati,102 or the ‘good’, the agents of satk(cid:8)ta? A very similar defi-
nition is given in MS 2.1:
vidvadbhiþ sevitaþ sadbhir nityam adveùar(cid:2)gibhiþ|
h(cid:8)dayen(cid:2)bhyanuj(cid:9)(cid:2)to yo dharmas taü nibodhata||
Learn that dharma which is followed by learned good men who assent
to it in their hearts and who are always devoid of hatred and passion.
This conception of dharma has much in common with both the third
and fourth sources of dharma given in the MS (2.6, 12) and YS (1.7):
that a learned man’s conduct and his ‘self satisfaction’ can determine
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
101 Ghoshal (A History, p.230) seems to take vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala as simply the royal sage’s
(r(cid:2)jarùi) way of living when in distress. His discussion, however, is quite limited.
102 Whether implied, or carried over from 130.14 (15-17 being an interlude).
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 223
what dharma is.103 There seems to be little ambiguity in this excerpt
from Manu, since both passive verbs (sevitaþ and abhyanuj(cid:9)(cid:2)to) can
readily be accounted for by the same agent (sadbhir), and therefore
the ‘heart’ (h(cid:8)daya) can be read as belonging to the ‘good’.104 In the
version found in (cid:2)DhP 130.18 however, things are a little less
straight-forward. While satk(cid:8)ta would seem to have the ‘good’ (sat) as
its agent, what is the agent of abhyanuj(cid:9)(cid:2)ta? Is it once again the sat,
so that we could interpret it more or less in the same way as most
translators take the MS passage? Or do we have to imply an agent,
such as the king, the assumed subject of the singular verb vyavasyati?
If we take the former possibility, then there is no controversy; dharma
is established according to ‘what is assented in the hearts of the good’,
a sound source of dharma at least since the time of Manu. On the
other hand, if we read the agent of the verb to be the king,105 then this
would extend to the (wise) king those hermeneutic principles that pro-
vide the foundation for determining proper dharma; such concepts as
vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala, and a more relaxed approach to (cid:5)(cid:3)stric prescription,
which recognise the differences between (cid:3)(cid:2)stras as they apply to dif-
ferent situations, could be used to sanction the king’s own particular
duties a time of distress demands he perform. If this is so, then what in
Manu is a method learned br(cid:3)hmans can apply to ascertain what is
dharma, in the (cid:2)DhP becomes a method a wise king can apply to jus-
tify his own behaviour in restoring a kingdom that is in distress. We
will return to this issue as we read further into the (cid:2)DhP, and further
test the merit of this understanding of the passage.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
103 That the man is a (cid:3)iùña, a br(cid:3)hman learned in the Veda, is implicit in these pas-
sages. Cf. MS 2.6cd (cid:2)c(cid:2)ra(cid:3) caiva s(cid:2)dh(cid:6)n(cid:2)m (cid:2)tmanas tuùñir eva ca; MS 2.12 and YS
1.7 sad(cid:2)c(cid:2)rah svasya ca priyam (cid:2)tmanaþ.
104 Most translators of Manu understand 2.1 in this way. Olivelle, however, takes
p(cid:2)da c as an independent clause, making “the Law something that all people ac-
knowledge in their hearts, paralleling the ‘what is pleasing to onseself’ ((cid:2)tmatuùñi) of
verse 2.6” (Manu’s Code of Law, p.243 note to 2.1). The context of MS 2.6, however,
seems to imply that it is especially the ‘self-satisfaction’ of the ‘learned, good’ man
that matters (see note 103 above). Olivelle cites three other MS verses in support of
his translation (4.161, 11.234 and 12.35), two of which (4.161 and 12.35) clearly have
connations of men of particular learning (the sn(cid:2)taka in 4.161, i.e. a br(cid:3)hman recently
having completed his studentship; and in 12.35 a vidvas, ‘learned man’, who in this
case is described as knowing relatively esoteric knowledge).
105 Fitzgerald appears to take the agent of abhyanuj(cid:9)(cid:2)ta to be the king, but he
makes no further comment on the significance of this. In his note to 130.3 (The Ma-
h(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.759) he does restrict the application of vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala as it is taught
here to br(cid:3)hmans (but see also his translation to (cid:2)DhP 140.5-6 and his note to 140.5
on p.767); see also below p.282 n.272.
224 CHAPTER SIX
6.4 ‘A bandit’s way of life’ (Mbh 12.131; SU 4)
The absence of a pra(cid:3)na in this and the following five units may seem
to undermine the central position I give to the pra(cid:3)na in providing
some kind of organisation to the (cid:2)DhP. However, the pra(cid:3)nas that
open SUs 1-3 seem to delineate much of the thematic space which SU
4 and the following units occupy. Note, for example, that both the
ko(cid:3)a and the dasyu, the two themes occupying the present unit, figure
prominently in these pra(cid:3)nas.106 In this way, the framing capacity of
these pra(cid:3)nas goes beyond the thresholds of the particular units which
embed them.
The first half of the present unit begins by revisiting a theme al-
ready covered in SU 1, the importance of the treasury (ko(cid:3)a). The par-
allel between these two sections is sometimes quite close. In a similar
fashion to SU 1, most of the verses dealing with the royal treasury at-
tempt to establish its fundamental significance and the dependency of
dharma upon it. This is apparent in the opening stanzas: a king should
generate (saüjanayet) a treasury from his own or another’s kingdom,
‘because law (dharma), which is the foundation of a kingdom [or, a
king’s rule], proceeds from the treasury’ (130.1).107 Not only is
dharma dependent on the royal treasury, but the acts of establishing
and maintaining it are themselves seen as dharma (131.2):
tasm(cid:2)t saüjanayet ko(cid:3)aü saüh(cid:8)tya parip(cid:2)layet|
parip(cid:2)ly(cid:2)nug(cid:8)hõ(cid:5)y(cid:2)d eùa dharmaþ san(cid:2)tanaþ||
Therefore he should generate a treasury. Once having collected it the
king should guard it, and having guarded it he should show kindness.
This is the eternal dharma.108
Most of the following verses variously formulate positions describing
the central significance of the treasury in relation to aspects of a king’s
rule. The army (bala) and the treasury are interdependent, because
without the army the king’s rule (r(cid:2)jya) is impossible, and without the
king there would be no (cid:3)r(cid:5) (131.4). (cid:7)r(cid:5), the prosperity or royal splen-
dour that accompanies competent ruling, is the reason the king ‘should

108 Cf. 128.12 (especially 12a and c) above p.205. This is an adaptation of a com-
mon n(cid:5)ti formula. See below p.264.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 225
cause his treasury, army, and allies to prosper’,109 since it is because of
(cid:3)r(cid:5) that the king is treated respectfully, and his evils are concealed
(131.7); devoid of wealth (h(cid:5)nako(cid:3)a), on the other hand, he does not
enjoy respect and people ignore his authority (131.6).
Before the chapter shifts focus slightly, there is a further stanza
containing a general injunction on the proper performance of royal
duties (131.9):
udyacched eva na gl(cid:2)yed udyamo hy eva pauruùam|
apy aparvaõi bhajyeta na nameteha kasya cit||
He should exert himself and not weaken, for exertion alone is manly.
Even should he break where there is no joint, he should not bow before
anyone in this world.110
Fitzgerald rightly notes the implied contrast here between pauruùa
(which he translates as “the human contribution to what happens”) and
“fate and chance” (i.e. daiva).111 Pauruùa is an attribute particuarly
associated with kings, since it is especially a king’s duty to intervene
in the course of events to affect their outcomes for the better. This is
reflected, for example, in the idea that the king ‘makes the age’.112 The
relationship, or tension, between ‘divine fate’ (daiva) and the king’s
duty to act with exertion (utth(cid:2)na) and ‘manliness’ is explored else-
where too.113 It is no surprise, then, that pauruùa is associated here
with ‘exertion’ (udyama), another kùatriya or royal characteristic.114
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

KA 2.12.37: … ko(cid:3)(cid:2)d daõóaþ praj(cid:2)yate| p(cid:8)thiv(cid:5) ko(cid:3)adaõó(cid:2)bhy(cid:2)ü pr(cid:2)pyate …||
‘… from the treasury the army arises, with the treasury and the army the earth is ac-
quired …’
110 Fitzgerald’s translation places a paragraph break between the first and last two
padas of 131.9. However, I consider the second two padas to continue the theme of
royal duties begun in the first two. It makes sense, though, to take 131.10 as continu-
ing 131.9cd, since it provides an avenue for one that does not ‘submit’ to an enemy.
This stanza also occurs at Mbh 5.125.19 and 132.38, with the variation named for
gl(cid:2)yed in 9a, a variation contained in a significant number of (cid:2)DhP manuscripts as
well.

pp.168ff.
114 Cf. RDhP 128.19 in which udyama and b(cid:2)huv(cid:5)rya are cited as royal attributes.
These attributes are further explored in association with ‘manliness’ in the instructions

For it is precisely through his exertion, his ‘human’ or ‘manly’ inter-
vention into events partly beyond his control, events which might con-
stitute a situation of (cid:2)pad (daiva, or divine fate, is the exemplar of
events that are beyond one’s control115), that the king must establish
the treasury, and secure his kingdom from any calamitous situation.116
For all this significance given to the treasury, little is said about how it
is actually generated, apart from a rather general statement in 131.3.
The second half of the chapter shifts focus, however, and stanzas
131.10 onwards introduce a new, and somewhat surprising, avenue for
the king to explore, the dasyu or ‘bandit’. The relationship between
the two topics of this unit is the instrumental value the dasyu has for
the king in distress.
This unit has little to say on a precise identity of the dasyu. It is
clear from this and other texts, however, that the dasyu is a lawless
figure inspring terror who exists on the margins or even outside of the
society of norms and duties reflected in the br(cid:3)hmaõic notion of
dharma. The passage in 131.10-18 alternates between two poles: the
capability of dasyus to behave in a threatening or horrifying manner,
and the concomitant problem of how then to control them. Their
threatening nature is both an opportunity and a hazard. The argument
revolves around the mary(cid:2)d(cid:2) of the dasyus, their ‘law’, a word which
also commonly means ‘limit’ or ‘boundary’ in a spatial sense, and
suggests the spatial separation between the dasyu and br(cid:3)hmaõic civil
life, reflected, for example, in the dasyus’ occupation of the forest
(araõya), in contrast to the ‘civilised’ village (or urban) environment
that was the centre of the br(cid:3)hmaõic world. It is intriguing that the
word for ‘law’ here is mary(cid:2)d(cid:2) and not dharma. From the perspective
of orthodox Br(cid:3)hmaõism represented by the dharma literature, the
dasyu is often exluded from dharma. Being outside of the social world
of the (cid:2)rya, the ‘noble’ man of vedic orthodoxy, he neither partici-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
version of the above cited stanza). See also MS 7.102, 159; (cid:2)DhP 138.7; RDhP 75.5;
and above p.149 n.49.
115 It is worth recalling at this point the distinction in the KA between calamities of
human (m(cid:2)nuùa) and divine (daiva) origin. See above p.61.
116 Cf. also KA 6.1.2-6, the list of excellences of the king (sv(cid:2)misampat), which
stresses some of these attributes (mahots(cid:2)ha, ‘great energy’ in 6.1.3; and puruùak(cid:2)ra
and (cid:2)patprak(cid:8)tyor viniyokt(cid:2) ‘acting in normal times or crisis’ in 6.1.6). See also be-

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 227
pates in those behaviours characteristic of the (cid:2)rya, nor lives in the
proper region of br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma, (cid:2)ry(cid:2)varta. We shall shortly see
in SU 6 ((cid:2)DhP 133), however, that there other conceptions of both the
dasyu and dharma, that share and part from such conceptions.
The dasyus’ position on the edge or outside of the world of br(cid:3)h-
maõically defined social institutions provides an opportunity for the
king who is in difficulties. Following on from the idea that the king
should ‘not submit’ to an enemy (131.9), it is suggested that he may
seek refuge in the forest (araõya), wandering with ‘gangs of bandits’
(dasyugaõa), though not with those ‘whose laws have been eradi-
cated’ (uddh(cid:8)tamary(cid:2)da).117 The forest, usually considered hostile ter-
ritory, is here conceived as a refuge for the king in distress.118 But the
forest as refuge is not the only point of this passage, for in addition ‘an
army of dasyus is useful for doing horrifying deeds’.119 A similar rec-
ommendation is found in KA 7.14.27, which advocates using various
‘outsiders’ when the circumstances necessitate: if the king is ‘weak in
energy’ (uts(cid:2)hah(cid:5)na) he ‘should secure the assistance of bands of
thieves, forest tribes and mlecchas (barbarians)’.120 The (cid:2)DhP, how-
ever, further ponders the reason they are useful, ‘since, invariably, all
people tremble before one who has no law’121 and, what is more, ‘in
the same way that theft is regarded by the good [i.e. it is disapproved
of], so too is non-violence regarded by bandits (dasyus)’ (131.14).122
By using the dasyu, the king does not, as it were, get his own hands
dirty. Paradoxically, therefore, it is the very characteristic that makes
the dasyu dangerous that also makes him useful. This reflects a gen-
eral paradox underlying the idea of (cid:2)paddharma: just as dharma can
be re-established through behaviour which exists outside of the usual
purview of dharma, so also the bandit (and perhaps other cultural out-

siders) who has a dubious relationship to law can be used to re-
establish law.
But there are limits to and problems with the application of this
proposal. Just as the usefulness of dasyus is due to their ability to do
‘dreadful things’, so the king must attempt to constrain them as well.
In 131.12 he ‘should establish law (mary(cid:2)d(cid:2)) which soothes people’s
minds’,123 and in 131.15 a number of activities are listed which are
‘prohibited for dasyus’ (dasyuùv … vigarhitam),124 such as ‘the slaugh-
ter of one not fighting, touching another’s wife’, and so on. When
forced to associate with them, these are the laws (the boundari-
es—mary(cid:2)d(cid:2)) the king should impose on the dasyus. The passage
closes by reaffirming the essential differentness of the dasyu, and
warning the king to recognise his own limitations (131.16):
sa eùa eva bhavati dasyur et(cid:2)ni varjayan|
abhisaüdadhate ye na vin(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:2)y(cid:2)sya bh(cid:2)rata|
na(cid:3)eùam evop(cid:2)labhya na kurvant(cid:5)ti ni(cid:3)cayaþ||
Even avoiding these [i.e. the crimes listed in 131.15] he is certainly still
a bandit. They who make no peace with them, Bh(cid:3)rata, do not then try
to destroy them until they have no survivor. This is the settled conclu-
sion.
The king must not destroy the dasyus merely because he is powerful
(131.17). Leaving survivors encourages a reciprocal attitude; one
should not destroy everyone because one is always ‘fearful of com-
plete annihilation’ (a(cid:3)eùakaraõ(cid:2)d bhayam) oneself,125 presumably be-
cause the outcome of war is never guaranteed, and the dasyu is by na-
ture unreliable and a ‘law-breaker’. By ensuring that dasyus hold to
the law (mary(cid:2)d(cid:2)), the king gives them ‘laws’ that function like
‘boundaries’, confining them, limiting their activies and keeping them
socially segregated and spatially removed. The dasyu is the antithesis
of all that is dharma; hence the law that applies to him is a law of
boundaries, of being kept away on the margins, since the dasyu is
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
123 I understand this to mean he establishes law among the dasyus.
124 Fitzgerald’s translation, ‘all these are censured among the barbarians’, leaves it
slightly open as to whether it is the barbarians self-regulating themselves to avoid
these crimes, or if they are made to avoid them by someone else (i.e. the king).
Dasyuùu must be taken as a locative of reference (nimittasaptam(cid:5)), not some kind of
oblique agent of the verb vigarhita. It is likely, I think, that we should imply the king
as the agent of the verb, which accords with the general sense of the passage.
125 Cf. similar warnings elsewhere in the RDhP, e.g. 104.36 and 107.18 (which is
parallel to 131.18).
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 229
someone who habitually ignores ‘laws’ or ‘boundaries’ (nir-
mary(cid:2)d(cid:2)).126
6.5 ‘In praise of power’ (Mbh 12.132; SU 5)
The theme governing this unit is the relationship between political
power (bala) and dharma. However, the text veers off into other areas
as well, such as the consequences of being powerless and wicked, and,
consequently, how to release oneself from evil. This unit also presents
a number of difficulties which are not easily resolved. Some of its
complexities arise out of difficulties in establishing how some of its
key terms relate to each other. It speaks variously of artha, ‘material
wealth, prosperity, political prosperity’, bala, ‘power, political power,
military force’, and people who are (cid:2)óhya, ‘wealthy’. While wealth
and power could be understood as subsets of artha, the shift from one
term to another makes difficult a precise understanding of which sense
is operating at any particular time.
In acknowledging some of the difficulties of the passage in 132.2-
9, Fitzgerald suggests that we are dealing with an interpolated text:
My translation takes (cid:5)lokas 2-5 as a single statement arguing that,
though Law is basically unseen, it bears real and important fruit. I then
take (cid:5)lokas 6 and 7 as a later interpolation, for not only does it make an
argument that seems to run counter to the complementarity argued
above [i.e., in 132.1], but 7ef (“There is nothing the strong cannot ac-
complish, and for the strong nothing is polluting”) basically implies that
dharma is superflous.127
However, I am not convinced that the intention behind these passages
is to render dharma superfluous, but rather that its authors were in-
dulging in the common (cid:5)(cid:3)stric pactrice of hyperbole. Furthermore, the
notion of ‘complementarity’ must also be interrogated. In what sense
do artha and dharma complement each other? The following offers an
alternative solution to some of the problems the text presents.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
126 E.g. RDhP 79.18, 101.3; (cid:2)DhP 133.10.
127 The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.760-1. Fitzgerald asks some suggestive questions
in the same note. I must thank Fitzgerald for discussions of this text which proved
enormously beneficial, especially in regard to for 132.5ab, and the relationship be-
tween bala and artha.
230 CHAPTER SIX
The opening stanza makes two important claims. Firstly, ‘dharma and
artha are obvious to the perceptive kùatriya; there should be no sepa-
ration of them …’ (pratyakù(cid:2)v eva dharm(cid:2)rthau kùatriyasya vij(cid:2)na-
taþ| tatra na vyavadh(cid:2)tavyaü …); and secondly, ‘the way of dharma
is hidden’ (parokù(cid:2) dharmay(cid:2)pan(cid:2)). There is a clear juxtaposition
here between two opposing characteristics, pratyakùa and parokùa.
Stanzas 132.2-3 partially elaborate this basic distinction. Not only are
dharma and adharma difficult to distinguish, but also their fruit ‘can-
not be seen’ (na dadar(cid:3)a).128 Stanza 132.2, therefore, indicates that the
first stanza’s designation of dharm(cid:2)rthau as pratyakùa, ‘obvious,
clear, readily detectable’, does not mean that they are easily detectable
in themselves, but rather, as Fitzgerald points out, that the two ‘go
together’ in some ‘readily detectable’ way. Stanza 132.3 introduces
the term bala, though it is not clear how this term should be under-
stood. Certainly it is an aspect of, or bears a close relationship to, ar-
tha, introduced already in 132.1; but it is an open question if bala
should, at least in this stanza, be equated with artha. The point ap-
pears to be that, since the king cannot decisively ascertain dharma (a
point established in stanzas 1 and 2), he should devote himself to what
is tangible, the power that enables royal prosperity ((cid:3)r(cid:5)).129 Securing
power secures royal prosperity ((cid:3)r(cid:5)). We are still, however, no clearer
on how artha and dharma ‘go together’.
Stanzas 132.4-5 begin to complicate the argument and raise certain
terminological difficulties:
yo hy an(cid:2)óhyaþ sa patitas tad ucchiùñaü yad alpakam|
bahv apathyaü balavati na kiü cit tr(cid:2)yate bhay(cid:2)t|| 132.4
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
128 132.2. Dharma and adharma ‘are just like the footprints of a wolf’ (etad yath(cid:2)
v(cid:8)kapadaü tath(cid:2)). As the commentators Vimalabodha and N(cid:8)lakaõñha, and Fitzgerald,
suggest, this is because these footprints are indistinguishable from a dog or a tiger.
For another explanation see Belvalkar’s note to this stanza, and Fitzgerald, op. cit.,
p.761. The idea of the ad(cid:8)ùña nature of dharma is found especially in (cid:2)DhS 1.20.1ff.
This was an important principle in M(cid:5)m(cid:2)üs(cid:2), see also Hacker, “Dharma im Hinduis-
mus,” pp.96ff.
129 Cf. N(cid:8)lakaõñha, ‘having disregarded dharma and adharma whose fruits are un-
seen … [the king] should adhere to power alone’ (ad(cid:8)ùñaphalau dharm(cid:2)dharm(cid:2)v
ap(cid:2)sya| … balam ev(cid:2)(cid:3)rayed …|). This is stronger than I would put it. Dharma is not
so much disregarded as developed as a consequence of the appropriate application of
power. N(cid:8)lakaõñha’s subsequent ‘tenfold’ description of balam has many dharmic
aspects.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 231
Since a [powerful man] without wealth is disgraced, and what little
wealth he has is rejected, there is much that is unsalutary for a man who
has power; nothing saves him from this danger.
ubhau saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)rau tau tr(cid:2)yete mahato bhay(cid:2)t|
ati dharm(cid:2)d balaü manye bal(cid:2)d dharmaþ pravartate|| 132.5
When both have the authority of the truth, those two save him [the
king] from grave danger. Power is superior to law (dharma). I reckon
law (dharma) proceeds from power.
Stanza 132.4ab posits a distinction between bala and artha, and intro-
duces a mediating third notion, wealth, which itself is another aspect
of artha. The powerful man who is without wealth risks disgrace;
power, in effect, is not enough on its own. Note the dharmic terms
used to describe the ‘poor’ king: he is ‘fallen’ (patita), and what little
he has (alpaka) is regarded as ‘spat out’ (ucchiùña), as if, in his pov-
erty, he has violated his own dharma.130 The propositions in 132.4cd
and 132.5ab seem to be dialectically related as p(cid:6)rvapakùa and uttara-
pakùa. The former presents the thesis that apathyas (unsalutary things;
lit., ‘the wrong paths’) cannot be avoided, which the latter counters by
suggesting that there is a way to be saved ‘from this danger’: ubhau
saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)rau tau (‘when both have the authority of the truth, those
two ...’). But to what does this refer—bala and dharma, or artha and
dharma? If the latter, this would connect it to the proposition in 132.1,
giving one answer to the problem of how artha and dharma ‘go to-
gether’. When conjoined with dharma, artha—meaning especially
‘wealth’ or ‘material prosperity’—enables a powerful man to avoid an
apathya. Power is not enough on its own. A powerful man also re-
quires material well-being and a moral order to satisfy his subjects and
ensure a well ordered kingdom; artha (wealth) and dharma ‘go to-
gether’ since they are correctives to and bolster power (bala, as an
aspect of artha). Alternatively, this may merely be asserting that it is
the combination of either artha or bala—their meanings being indis-
tinct in this case—with dharma, that saves the king from the danger of
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
130 Patita, of course, is the normal term for one who has fallen from his varõa du-
ties and, consequently, from his varõa itself (see Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.4, pp.10ff.). Uc-
chiùña commonly refers to the inherently impure leftovers of the meal, and also some-
one who is in the impure state of still having these leftovers in his mouth or hands (see
Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.2, p.332 n.805; and C. Malamoud, “Remarks on the Brahmanic
Concept of the Remainder,” in Cooking the World, esp. pp.9ff.).
232 CHAPTER SIX
apathya.131 In rendering the phrase ubhau saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)rau as ‘when
both have the authrority of the truth’, I have taken it as asserting a
condition on the operation of tau [artha/baladharmau] that softens the
potential for the king to abitrarily employ this argument; in stretching
the limits of artha/bala and dharma to save himself from ‘grave dan-
ger’, there must be, in effect, just cause.132
More difficult to explain are the bold assertions in 132.5cd that
suggest dharma depends on bala. This continues in subsequent stan-
zas, culminating in 132.7ef: ‘there’s nothing that is irremediable to the
powerful; among the powerful everything is virtuous’ (n(cid:2)sty as(cid:2)dh-
yaü balavat(cid:2)ü sarvaü balavat(cid:2)ü (cid:3)uci). If a non-interpolated view of
132 is to stand, then it must somehow explain these statements. For
Fitzgerald, the complementarity indicated by the dual statements in
132.1 and 132.5 is contradicted by these passages, since they admit to
bala’s independence from dharma. Taken by itself, 7ef might indeed
merit being understood to commend power as beyond and distinct
from dharma. In context, however, it is perhaps better taken as an in-
stance of hyperbole.133 Other statements, notably 5d through to 7d,
tend to assert a relationship in which dharma has bala as its precondi-
tion: dharma arises from power. It seems to me that the point here is
that the proper exercise of power, which encourages royal prosperity
((cid:3)r(cid:5), 132.3), is a precondition for the rising of dharma. The equation
with which we are dealing is that of the kingdom and dharma; without
the kingdom there is no dharma, a position in keeping with the rela-
tionship of political conduct as represented in n(cid:5)ti texts like the RDhP,
(cid:2)DhP and the KA.134 By enabling the kingdom to survive, dharma too
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
131 Belvalkar suggests that saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)rau is synonymous for baladharmau, while
N(cid:8)lakaõñha takes ubhau to refer to baladharmau (N(cid:8)lakaõñha’s text presumably having
the ‘vulgate’ variant saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)rasthau for saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)rau tau).
132 Fitzgerald translates, “These two [dharma and artha] that are grounded in fun-
damental reality itself save one from great danger.” In my view ‘grounded in funda-
mental reality’ is an excessively ontological rendering of saty(cid:2)dhik(cid:2)ra that does not
do justice to that passage’s political context.
133 Or rather, what Gerow describes as: “…the henotheistic tendency (extolling as
supreme the purpose of present concern) of Sanskrit authors…”, see E. Gerow and A.
Aklujkar, “On (cid:7)(cid:2)nta Rasa in Sanskrit Poetics,” JAOS, 92 (1972), p.85. Henotheism
was an idea first suggested by Max M(cid:10)ller. For criticisms of this, but for a similar
argument to mine in respect to hyperbole in the MS, see Olivelle, “Structure,”
pp.557f.; Manu’s Code of Law, pp.33-5.
134 Remember also the above statements which equate ruling with dharma (see
RDhP 128.47, above p.210). The dependence of dharma on artha is a theme dis-
(cid:3)
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 233
survives. This text, therefore, eulogises political power—typically,
with hyperbole—while recognising that it has limits. What is ‘obvi-
ous’ about dharma and artha, that they ‘should not be separated’, is a
product of a mutual dependence: firstly, artha (wealth) and dharma go
together because wealth and a moral order necessarily correct and fos-
ter power (bala—an aspect of artha!); secondly, artha and dharma go
together because bala (political power) is necessary for dharma to
flourish.
The remainder of the unit clearly bears a close relationship to
RDhP 123.16ff., to the extent of very close and often exact verbal
similarity.135 In their present location, these stanzas emphasise that this
unit is about the problems and virtues of political power. The three
stanzas 132.8-10 relate the sorry plight of the man who has acted
badly (dur(cid:2)c(cid:2)ra) and whose power is in decline (kù(cid:5)õabala), appar-
ently revisiting the terrain of 132.4ab; while those from 132.11-15
discuss how he can be ‘delivered from evil’ (p(cid:2)pasya parimokùaõe).
This again is a difficult passage whose full meaning does not easily
present itself. It is apparent, however, that it deals with the accommo-
dation of the many morally dubious acts associated with ruling and the
consequences of these actions for the individual who performs them.
That it begins the discussion by speaking of the man who ‘acts badly’
(dur(cid:2)c(cid:2)ra) and whose ‘power is in decline’ (kù(cid:5)nabala) suggests that
certain kinds of behaviour are only justified if the ends they serve are
actually met, that is, in the stability or restitution of the kingdom. For
the king who fails to achieve this end incurs both the sin of the failure
of his primary duty, as well as the sins of the various activities which
he has performed in this failed attempt. The last five stanzas represent
a kind of pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta (though without the usual specificity which asso-
ciates particular acts with particular absolutions) in order that the king
may seek atonement for his behaviour and restore his position.
Clearly, these statements bear on the relationship of dharma to artha
and dharma to bala. Power, it seems, is a good thing, despite it in-
volving what might otherwise be dur(cid:2)c(cid:2)ra ‘bad conduct’, as long as it
serves a stable kingdom and thereby provides fertile grounds for
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
cussed by Arjuna in (cid:2)DhP 161.9ff. (see below pp.382ff.), and is a position found in
KA 1.7.6-7 and 9.7.81.
135 See Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.761 for references. The parallel pas-
sage in 12.123 is far more transparent. A close analysis of the intertextual relationship
between the two might be revealing.
234 CHAPTER SIX
dharma. Once, however, such power collapses, and the appropriate
reason (i.e., dharma) for its existence suffers as a result, then bad con-
duct is just bad conduct. In some respects, this text leaves the impres-
sion of wanting to have it both ways (which is, perhaps, a useful char-
acterisation of (cid:2)paddharma in general), uneasily straddling the tension
between the improprieties associated with ruling, and the proprieties
demanded by the assertion of standards of civil behaviour with which
the king, too, must seek accommodation.
Despite the difference between Fitzgerald’s and my approaches to this
text, they share a common presupposition—that there is some kind of
syntactic continuity to be uncovered in the statements that constitute
the balapra(cid:3)aüsanam. There can be few more fundamental assump-
tions than this in any process of reading. This leads Fitzgerald to ex-
plain this unit’s logical inconsistencies by way of interpolation theory,
thereby recovering a logically continuous text from a descendant in-
terspersed with other material added in the process of transmission;
while I attempt to account for such ‘contradictions’ by reference to
particular narrative conventions (p(cid:6)rvapakùa/uttarapakùa, hyperbole),
thereby assuming that the text as it is presented is syntactically coher-
ent, requiring only a perceptive explanation to account for this coher-
ence. Both approaches, however, share the weakness of positing an-
other order of textual composition other than that presented by the text
itself. Perhaps, however, the presupposition itself ought to be ques-
tioned. Maybe the text is merely a compilation of material united by
the logic of thematic continuity? Notions of either interpolation or
syntactic continuity would then be beside the point. It is regretable
that the formative discursive contexts of texts such as this are lost to
us, since they would undoubtedly illuminate many of our problems. If
we assume, for example, that these texts were recited in some kind of
pedagogic content, when might the recitation have been paused to al-
low for further exposition? If there had been such, would the relation-
ships between such statements have been explained? Are stanzas that
Fitzgerald takes to be interpolations the result of interjections in such
a context?
6.6 ‘The deeds of K(cid:2)pavya’ (Mbh 12.133; SU 6)
This is the first of the narrative units of the (cid:2)DhP containing a story
or fable illustrating some lesson, or treating in some other way, a point
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 235
raised by the text. In this case, there is a short tale which relates the
deeds of a ‘bandit’ (dasyu) named K(cid:3)pavya. In many ways this unit
can be considered a continuation of the second half of SU 4. Both
speak to the problem of how a king should relate to dasyus, a theme
opened up in an earlier pra(cid:3)na (130.1). Besides their thematic congru-
ence, an occasionally striking verbal similarity suggests some compo-
sitional relationship between the two units.136 While the earlier unit
considered the conduct of dasyus in terms of law designated by the
term mary(cid:2)d(cid:2), ‘boundary, limit’, the present unit continues this theme
and further ponders the position of the dasyu in relationship to
dharma, a relationship which has significant theological and cultural
implications for the br(cid:3)hmaõic concept of dharma.
The tale can be simply summarised:
There was a ruler of the Niù(cid:3)das called K(cid:3)pavya who, despite being a
bandit (dasyu), was a moral man, following the kùatriya’s code
(dharma). The many lawless (nirmary(cid:2)da) bandits selected him as their
leader because of his wisdom, virtue and strength. K(cid:3)pavya instituted a
strict social code of moral conduct, which was happily adopted by the
bandits and administered by K(cid:3)pavya. As a result, K(cid:3)pavya gained
great perfection (mahat(cid:5)ü siddhim).
The terms dasyu and niù(cid:2)da both indicate that the individual so called
is outside of or on the margins of the br(cid:3)hmaõic socio-cultural uni-
verse. The dasyu has been the focus of animosity in the Indian tradi-
tion since vedic times, when the (cid:2)rya—the self-described ‘noble’ man
as exponent of vedic orthodoxy—was frequently contrasted with the
dasyu in terms stressing the latter’s different customs and ‘unlawful-
ness’.137 In later times, dasyu came to sometimes refer to a particular
ethnic group,138 sometimes to various peoples regarded in a broad
sense as ‘barbarian’, or sometimes to people notorious for lawless and
unruly behaviour and best understood as ‘bandits’. Broadly speaking it
refers to a people not participating in the dominant br(cid:3)hmaõic culture,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
136 Note, for example, that 133.10 and 131.11 both describe dasyus as niranukro(cid:3)a-
k(cid:2)rin, ‘acting without compassion’, a compound I have not found anywhere else in
the Mbh.

The definition in MS 10.45 is indicative:

In this world, all those castes other than those born of the mouth, arms,
thighs and feet [of Brahm(cid:3), the primordial man]139—whether they speak
the language of the barbarian (mleccha) or the (cid:2)rya—are considered
dasyus.
In the royal instructions of the (cid:6)P the term dasyu frequently refers to
unruly and lawless people (hence ‘thieves’ or ‘bandits’), who are de-
picted as threatening to overrun the kingdom and its law-abiding
br(cid:3)hmiõically sanctified population.140 Not infrequently it is regarded
as a measure of a king’s worth (or the worth of kingship in general, or
the principal purpose of the kùatra, the ruling class) that such peoples
are held in check; the king is figured as the bulwark holding back the
tide of lawless brigands hovering at the edges of br(cid:3)hmaõic civilisa-
tion.141 While the designation of K(cid:3)pavya as dasyu marks him in a
general way for exclusion and banditry (a labeling which he, however,
defies), the term niù(cid:2)da localises his exclusion and situates him more
firmly within the br(cid:3)hmaõic social order, defining his position in an
ideology of class hierarchy that figures him as a product of miscege-
nation.142 A niù(cid:2)da is usually regarded as a fisherman or a hunter,143
occupations typically the preserve of the low-born. In frequent refer-
ences to his existence in the forest (araõya; 133.4, 6, 8. 25, 26) and his
‘wandering along the P(cid:3)riy(cid:3)tra ranges’ (133.5),144 the (cid:2)DhP provides

139 The origin of the varõas is explained in MS 1, see especially 1.31 and 87. This
origin myth is, of course, based on the Puruùas(cid:6)kta. See also p.112 above.
140 Indeed this is the sense suggested by the pra(cid:3)na in 130.1, see above pp.217f.
See also RDhP 67.2; 68.20; 79.18. See also above p.217 n.88.
141 See e.g. RDhP 12.27; 25.11; 65.15-31; 67.2; 68.20; 74.8, 10; 76.5; 89.20; 90.8;
98.8; 101.3. Cf. MS 7.142-4.
142 In (cid:2)DhP 133.3 K(cid:3)pavya is described as being born from the (anuloma) union
of a kùatriya man and niù(cid:2)d(cid:5) woman. The dharma texts offer various anuloma de-
scriptions of the origins of the niù(cid:2)da: MS 10.8; GDhS 4.16; BDhS 1.16.7, 17.3,
2.3.29; VDhS 18.8.

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 237
additional keys to the symbolism of K(cid:3)pavya and the dasyus. The
P(cid:3)riy(cid:3)tra is part of the Western Vindhya ranges, which forms, as
BDhS 1.2.9 and VDhS 1.8 tell us, one of the boundaries of (cid:2)ry(cid:2)varta,
that region where the authoritative form of dharma is found.145 This
area, where the ‘black antelope roams’, forms the zone proper to
br(cid:3)hmaõic civilisation, the geo-political area of ‘vedic splendour’
(brahmavarcasam),146 and of the sacrifice, from which cultural and
regional outsiders such as dasyus, barbarians (mlecchas) and various
‘low-born’ peoples are excluded.147 K(cid:3)pavya and his dasyu followers
occupy the zone on the edge of this dharmic universe and, according
to the orthodox br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma exemplified in the dharma litera-
ture, they should be avoided148 since, ideally, as the above citation
from the MS suggests, they are excluded from the most orthodox sys-
tem of varõadharma.149
The tale of K(cid:3)pavya, however, tells the story of a bandit who does
rigorously uphold dharmic norms. He is described in terms of what
ought to be two polarities. On the one hand he knows all the ‘forest
lore’ proper to his status as a forest-roaming bandit (133.4-5ab), and
on the other he knows ‘the dharma of all beings’150 and practices the
dharma appropriate to a kùatriya (133.5cd-6ab), properly looking after
his ‘blind parents’ (133.6cd-7) and ‘protecting the br(cid:3)hman, forest
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
145 See above p.115. Cf. also MS 2.21-2 and VDhS 1.9, which speak of the
Vindhyas in the same way. On this important idea, see also Zimmermann, The Jungle,
pp.47ff. (p.66 for a map); Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.2 pt.1, pp.11f. On Pata(cid:9)jali’s similar con-
ception, see Deshpande, “Historical change,” pp.131ff.
146 BDhS 1.2.12; VDhS 1.13.
147 See e.g. MS 2.23; RDhP 59.103; Zimmermann, The Jungle, pp.55-62. The
mleccha and the dasyu, while not normally equated, are often closely associated, see
e.g. RDhP 65.13ff.; (cid:2)DhP 162.28ff. (see below pp.391ff.); MS 10.45 (cited above);
and Parasher, Mlecchas, p.185 in regard to commentators on MS 10.45.
148 In MS 2.24 only a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra ‘emaciated by his livelihood’ (v(cid:8)ttikar(cid:3)ita) can reside
outside this land.
149 ViS 84.4 provides a very concise depiction of this. PMS 6.1.51-2 discusses the
controversy of whether or not a Niù(cid:3)da can perform the rites, see Kane HDh(cid:7) vol.2
pt.1 p.46; Rau, Staat, p.16. To be sure, the case does indeed require more nuance,
since outsiders like bandit dasyus and marginalised groups like ‘miscegenated’ niù-
(cid:2)das are afforded positions and prescribed occupations (in the case of niù(cid:2)das) within
the br(cid:3)hmaõic social structure. Such inclusion, of course, serves their peripheral posi-
tioning in the br(cid:3)hmaõic socio-cultural order.
150 The parallelism between 133.4c vidhij(cid:9)o m(cid:8)gaj(cid:2)t(cid:5)n(cid:2)ü ‘understanding the be-
haviour of the species of animals’, and 133.5c dharmaj(cid:9)aþ sarvabh(cid:6)t(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü, ‘under-
standing the proper duties of all beings’ makes for a startling juxtaposition.
238 CHAPTER SIX
dwelling ascetics’,151 even being sensitive to his own impure status in
respect to such ascetics (133.9). The bandits ‘with no boundaries’ (nir-
mary(cid:2)da)—culturally bound but behaviourally antithetical to K(cid:3)pavya
—elect him as their leader, and he demands of them quite strict rules
of behaviour, among which the proper treatment of br(cid:3)hmans pre-
dictably figures prominently (133.14, 16, 18, 20). K(cid:3)pavya’s instruc-
tions (133.23: anu(cid:3)(cid:2)sana) close with this remarkable statement
(133.22):
ye punar dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)streõa varterann iha dasyavaþ|
api te dasyavo bh(cid:6)tv(cid:2) kùipraü siddhim av(cid:2)pnuyuþ||
In this world, however, those bandits who live by the law books, despite
having been bandits, quickly obtain perfection.
If many (indeed most) brahmaõic dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras push the ‘bandit’
dasyu to the very edge or even outside of the sphere of dharma, it
seems that this text is more accommodating, quite remarkably arguing
for a positive position for the bandit in relation to law (dharma). In-
deed a bandit who, far from threatening the norms of brahmanically
sanctioned dharma, is at one with the kùatriya he apparently emulates
in upholding dharmic norms.
Why, then, is K(cid:3)pavya represented in this way? The problems the
bandit poses for the br(cid:3)hmaõic world seem especially heightened in a
time of distress. This can be viewed in two distinct ways. The first, as
we have already seen in (cid:2)DhP 130.1, is the problem of the ‘dasyufica-
tion’ of the earth, which indicates its dire condition and that dharma
itself is no longer being upheld by its inhabitants.152 The second con-
cerns the idea of the forest as refuge, and the dasyu as instrument for
the king in distress, as related in SU 4 ((cid:2)DhP 132). Both of these sce-
narios share in the same conundrum: according to br(cid:3)hmaõic ideol-
ogy, contact with cultural outsiders and bandits involves certain dan-
gers because of their exclusion from dharma and (especially in the
latter case) their inherently violent nature, each case containing the
potential to undermine the cultural centrality of br(cid:3)hmaõically defined
social norms. How can they be controlled and how can one avoid any

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 239
‘impure’ consequences from associating with them?153 It could well be
that this reflects a real problem in ancient India as br(cid:3)hmaõic culture
expanded throughout South Asia and beyond. For once new areas
were occupied or conquered, or outsiders and ‘bandits’ initiated con-
tact with (cid:2)rya groups (perhaps formatively, given their predilection
for forests, with ascetic groups), how was the king to establish a rela-
tionship with the inhabitants, while, at least nominally, adhering to the
norms of dharma which, in their most conservative form represented
in the dharma literature, exclude non-(cid:2)rya ‘bandits’ and ‘barbari-
ans’?154 If the rigidity of the law books only reluctantly allows any
incorporation of such peoples within the circle of dharmic obligations
and their rewards, the Mbh, it seems, depicts a more flexible (not to
mention, more probable) situation. Already in RDhP 65.13ff there is a
passage detailing the various duties (dharma) a king should make bar-
barians perform, and this includes such groups as the yavana, c(cid:5)na,
andhra and so on, collectively called dasyu.155 Remarkably, they
should perform the ‘vedic laws and rites’ (vedadharmakriy(cid:2)) and, fur-
thermore, ‘dharma is ordained for them’ (teù(cid:2)ü dharmo vidh(cid:5)yate).156
This type of inclusion could also reflect a ‘real’ historical process, the
gradual ‘(cid:5)(cid:4)drification’ of various social groups existing on the mar-
gins of br(cid:3)hmaõic civilisation, a procedure which counters the
‘dasyufication’ (overrun by bandits) or ‘mlecchafication’ (overrun by
foreigners) of the earth by way of their absorption, so that they too
become part of the hierarchically ordered and endogamic varõa-j(cid:2)ti
system,157 thereby having a productive, if marginal, relationship to
br(cid:3)hmaõic law (dharma).
Be that as it may, the present passage seems to attend to whatever
threat the dasyu might represent, whether this be a threat of violence,
or merely of contact. The phala(cid:3)ruti contained in Bh(cid:8)ùma’s CS por-
trays the danger while pointing to its appeasement (133.25):
idaü k(cid:2)pavyacaritaü yo nityam anuk(cid:5)rtayet|

240 CHAPTER SIX
Who always narrates this deed of K(cid:3)pavya shall never come to fear the
people who live in the forest.
The fear or danger (bhaya) the dasyu represents is expressed as a real
problem, and neutralised through a demonstration of their ability to
follow dharma, and hence their incorporation within the system of
dharma.158 Contact with them is now not quite the problem it may
have been. And this incorporation has real benefits for the bandit niù-
(cid:2)da too, as perfection (siddhi) due to adherence to dharma is con-
ferred on the righteous dasyu (133.22, 24). Thus a reciprocal relation-
ship is established, a ‘social contract’, once again reinforcing the ad-
age ‘dharma protects those who protect dharma’.
Ariel Glucklich makes the point that conceptions of dharma and
conceptions of space belong to two separate ‘ontologies’: “A prohibi-
tion is not a wall”.159 While a rule of dharma can be established, it can
just as easily be manipulated or broken: there is no material barrier,
merely different degrees of agency and legitimation interacting with
each other. The ambivalent status of the dasyu emphasises this point.
If in SU 4 the king attempts to spatially isolate the dasyu, establishing
a boundary, law or limit (mary(cid:2)d(cid:2)) to confine him from any threat to
the dharmic universe embodied in the village or urban environment,160
an attempt which seems connected to the spatial notions of dharma
found in the normative and strictly orthodox dharma texts, then SU 6
recognises that “prohibition is not a wall”, that there is a disjunction
between the ideal and the actual, and that dharma is always socially
contested and socially evolving.
6.7 ‘Explaining what can and cannot be appropriated’
(Mbh 12.134; SU 7)
This is the shortest unit of the (cid:2)DhP, consisting of only ten stanzas.
Revisiting a theme found already in earlier units, it begins by an-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
158 K(cid:3)pavya’s half-kùatriya parentage and his aping of kùatriya behaviour seems
crucial in this figuration, since it is especially by dint of such characteristics he is
capable of bringing the lawless ‘full’ barbarians under control.

nouncing that it will relate some g(cid:2)th(cid:2)s ‘sung by Brahm(cid:3)’ (brahma-
g(cid:5)t(cid:2)), about the way in which ‘kings generate a treasury’ (…r(cid:2)janaþ
ko(cid:3)aü saüjanayanti …). This particular wording reflects the language
of the earlier units where the same theme is found.161 The present unit
is especially concerned with defining the grounds for the legitimate
generation and distribution of a royal treasury (ko(cid:3)a), that is to say, the
proper way of obtaining and using wealth.
Stanzas 134.2-5 establish some significant definitions which
ground the acquisition of wealth on a firm dharmic footing. Some of
these bear a distinct relationship to a passage in chapter 11 of the
MS.162 We start with a basic distinction in 134.2: the wealth of those
who ‘perform sacrifices’ (yaj(cid:9)a(cid:3)(cid:5)la) is the ‘property of the gods’
(devasvam) and hence not to be appropriated. Rather a king should
seize (hartum arhati) the property of bandits (dasyus) or of those who
do not perform the rites (niùkriya). Drawing upon a metaphor found
also in some vedic texts, the kùatriyas are said to be the ‘protectors
and eaters’ (rakùy(cid:2)(cid:3) c(cid:2)dy(cid:2)(cid:3) ca) of the people, hence the wealth
(dhana) they generate is his (134.3).163 The king should use this wealth
for either the army or the sacrifice (134.4); both have a fundamental
role in maintaining the kingdom’s relationship to dharma. In a similar
vein, stanza 134.5 describes the wealth of those who do not make of-
ferings to gods, ancestors and mortals, as ‘useless’,164 hence, a
‘dharmic prince’ (dh(cid:2)rmikaþ p(cid:8)thiv(cid:5)patiþ) should take it, for it does
not ‘gladden people’ (pr(cid:5)õayel lok(cid:2)n) and ‘wealth such as that is not a
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
161 RDhP 128.12 (SU 1) and (cid:2)DhP 131.1, 2 (SU 4) state their theme as ko(cid:3)aü
saüjanayed r(cid:2)j(cid:2). The use of this verb in this context is not found in the KA.
162 Compare (cid:2)DhP 134.2ab, MS 11.20ab; (cid:2)DhP 134.2cd, MS 11.18cd; (cid:2)DhP
134.7, MS 11.19 (and (cid:2)DhP 130.4).
163 See the table and the passages cited in Rau, Staat, pp.34f. for various formula-
tions of this idea. Scharfe (The State, p.143) regards this as an ‘old theory’ akin to the
idea of the ‘law of the fishes’, which has been superseded by the notion that the peo-
ple are the ‘children’ of the king. This seems, however, untenable. The notion that the
king ‘eats’ the people goes together with his protection of them. It is a symbiotic rela-
tionship where the one cannot do without the other. On the king and kùatriyas as ‘eat-
ers’, see also Smith, “Eaters, Food,” and Zimmermann, The Jungle, pp.207f.
164 The word given in the CE is (cid:2)nantik(cid:2)ü, which Belvalkar glosses as ‘void of
purpose’. Fitzgerald follows this though he is unsure of its sense (see The Mah(cid:2)b-
h(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.761). The second syllable -ant- is a doubtful reading in the CE, and
many manuscripts have -arth- in its place (usually preceded by a short vowel an-),
clearly giving the sense ‘pointless’. The reading (cid:2)n-antik(cid:2) perhaps suggests wealth
used without limitation, implying decadence. Dharma, of course, implies boundaries
and limits on behaviour; hence (cid:2)nantik(cid:2) would be wealth not used for dharmic pur-
poses, i.e., paradigmatically, sacrifices.
242 CHAPTER SIX
treasury’ (na ko(cid:3)aü tadvidhaü). This is an important definition: a le-
gitimate royal ‘treasury’ (ko(cid:3)a) is not just wealth as such, it is wealth
used for particular purposes. The king is justified in seizing wealth for
the treasury if he uses it in the proper way as defined by br(cid:3)hmaõic
ideology: the regular performance of the sacrifice, and the provision
of material welfare in order that people can exist in their proper
dharmas. This definition continues in stanza 7 (a repetition of (cid:2)DhP
130.4) which tells us that one knows dharma who ‘having taken from
the bad offers to the good’;165 stanzas 134.8 and 9 respectively affirm
that the wealth used in the sacrifice can derive from an ‘evil’ source
(e.g., bandits and other cultural outsiders),166 and that those who do not
perform the sacrifice (ayaj(cid:9)a) (i.e. who do not contribute to the main-
tenance of dharma) can legitimately be treated in the same way as one
treats annoying insects,167 ‘as such is dharma established’ (tath(cid:2)
dharmo vidh(cid:5)yate).
As with some earlier units concerned with the royal treasury, the
present unit shares much in common with the KA’s treatment of this
theme.168 Notably, both set limits on the proper generation of wealth.
Like the (cid:2)DhP, the KA encourages the seizing of wealth from those
who do not perform the proper rites (heretical groups—p(cid:2)ùaõóa-
saügha),169 but debars the king from exploiting the ‘wealth of the
gods’ (devadravya), that is to say, wealth intended for ritual use.170
However, the KA generally takes for granted the justification of the
acts aimed at generating a treasury, even when they become more ex-
treme. Yet, while the present unit of the (cid:2)DhP concerns the genera-
tion of the treasury, a n(cid:5)ti theme, it utilises as justification material
drawn from the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradition, which relates to the problem
of finding wealth (dhana) to use for the sacrifice when wealth is
scarce. The generation of the treasury is placed in a positive relation-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
165 as(cid:2)dhubhyo nir(cid:2)d(cid:2)ya s(cid:2)dhubhyo yaþ prayacchati| A similar stanza is found at
MS 11.19. The almost exact form of the two (cid:2)DhP stanzas shows their closer rela-
tionship.
166 Alternatively, with Belvalkar and N(cid:8)lakaõñha, tath(cid:2)yaj(cid:9)a in 134.8 could be ana-
lysed as tath(cid:2) ayaj(cid:9)a, and then be read with 134.9.
167 I follow Fitzgerald’s emendation of the CE from c(cid:2)õdapip(cid:5)likam to the better
attested caõóapip(cid:5)likam. See The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.761.
168 See above pp.68ff.
169 Later, the KA further focuses on taking wealth from treasonous and non-
dharmic people, see 5.2.69 and preceding passages.
170 KA 5.2.37. It is intriguing that the KA only debars the king from devadravya
‘not used by learned br(cid:3)hmans’ a(cid:3)rotriyopabhogya.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 243
ship to br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma, since it enables the most paradigmatic of
its pursuits, the sacrifice (yaj(cid:9)a). This combination of the two closely
related traditions of artha and dharma is apparent, for example, if we
compare the different contexts of the parallel passages from the MS
and the (cid:2)DhP (cited above in n.162). The MS passage concerns the
obtaining of wealth for the sacrifice from others when the sacrifice is
impeded in some way (MS 11.11ff.); in the (cid:2)DhP the wealth is not
just for the sacrifice, but for the army as well (134.4). The (cid:2)DhP ar-
gues for a closer relationship between the obtaining of wealth per se
and dharma. In a real sense the origin of dharma is found in the very
enabling of its pursuit and maintenance, and this enabling is precisely
what is established by the apparently mundane political concerns of
the king. It is the king’s willingness to perform violent duties, and his
awareness of their limitations, that enables dharma to be upheld; and
such duties are themselves, in fact, subtle dharma, as the metaphor in
the final stanza suggests (134.10):
yath(cid:2) hy akasm(cid:2)d bhavati bh(cid:6)mau p(cid:2)üsut(cid:8)õolapam|
tathaiveha bhaved dharmaþ s(cid:6)kùmaþ s(cid:6)kùmataro ’pi ca||
Just as grass and soft ulapa grass suddenly rises in dirt on the ground,
so dharma that is subtle, and even more subtle, shall arise in this world.
6.8 ‘The tale of the three fish’ (Mbh 12.135; SU 8)
This unit is the second in the (cid:2)DhP to present its own self-contained
narrative, and in this ‘tale of the fish’ we encounter the (cid:2)DhP’s first
proper example of the genre of fable, a fable well known in Indian
literature, being found in the Buddhist J(cid:2)takas, and in n(cid:5)ti texts such
as the Pa(cid:9)catantra and Hitopade(cid:3)a.171 We will briefly compare these
versions shortly. Firstly, a summary of the tale as it is found in (cid:2)DhP
135.2-16:
Three fish lived in a lake, the one ‘knowing the proper time to act’
(Pr(cid:3)ptak(cid:3)laj(cid:9)a), one who was ‘far seeing’ (D(cid:8)rghadar(cid:5)in) and the ‘pro-
crastinator’ (D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra). One day some fisherman began to drain the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
171 J(cid:2)taka no.114, Mitacintij(cid:2)takaü, in Fausbøll’s ed., pp.428ff. (trans. pp.256f.).
This fable, found in all versions of the Pa(cid:9)catantra, is book 1, story 11 of Edgerton’s
edition (pp.130-4) (Olivelle’s tr., based on Edgerton’s reconstructed text, story 8.2,
pp.52f.); C. Rajan’s tr., pp.133-5 (based on P(cid:4)rõabhadra’s recension)); and tale 4.2 in
Hitopade(cid:3)a, pp.213-17 of F. Hutchins’ translation.

lake in order to catch the fish. D(cid:8)rghadar(cid:5)in, seeing the danger, sug-
gested to his friends that they quickly leave. But D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra thought
they should not be so hasty, while Pr(cid:3)ptak(cid:3)laj(cid:9)a argued that they should
wait for the proper time before deciding what to do. The wise D(cid:8)rgha-
dar(cid:5)in escaped immediately. The fisherman drained the lake and cap-
tured the other two. The fish who knew the right time to act feigned be-
ing bound, and then escaped while the other fish were being cleaned.
But stupid D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra was killed.
The question that is uppermost here is this: what makes this version of
the story particularly suitable for, or even unique to the (cid:2)DhP? It is to
explore this question that I undertake a comparison between this and
other versions of the ‘three fish’ story. I will not explore or speculate
on the place of this version in the fable’s ‘genetic history’.172 I espe-
cially want to explore two things: first, the thematic concurrence be-
tween this fable and the (cid:2)DhP, a concurrence which accounts for its
inclusion; and second, a number of rhetorical features which firmly
cement its place within the (cid:2)DhP. I hope to show that the inclusion of
a tale like this in the (cid:2)DhP is neither the product of a haphazard crea-
tive decision, nor devoid of design.
The thematic concurrence of this text with the general theme of
(cid:2)pad is readily apparent. It is, after all, about three fish who find
themselves in a spot of trouble, and this is indicated in stanza 135.6 of
the (cid:2)DhP version by the keyword (cid:2)pad. This in itself may indicate a
certain rhetorical manipulation by the redactors of the Mbh, since this
word is not found in the Pa(cid:9)catantra or J(cid:2)taka versions of the fable,
though it does occur in the Hitopade(cid:3)a. However, there is still further
thematic relevance, since this fable contributes to the overall n(cid:5)ti ori-
entation of the (cid:2)DhP in its approach to the problem of (cid:2)pad and, by
combining two related themes, defines a general attitude the king must
exhibit in performing his royal responsibilities: firstly, a king should
not be dilatory; and secondly, he should know the proper time and
place to act. We will see later why these are appropriate to the context
of the (cid:2)DhP. These themes are made known through the acts of the
fish themselves, who embody various inflections of these two aspects
and hence are named accordingly.

fables, see Olivelle, The Pa(cid:9)catantra, pp.xxxii-iii.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 245
Frequently it is the names of the participants in fables which carry
the moral of the fable, and this is especially so in the tale of the three
fish.173 The table in FIGURE 9 gives each of the names of the fish as
they occur in its different versions. The J(cid:2)taka version differs substan-
tially from the other two,174 which, in turn, only differ from each other
in relatively minor details.175 The J(cid:2)taka tale has clearly been com-
posed with both its Buddhist and immediate narrative contexts in
mind. Though, like the others, it is essentially about taking control of
one’s destiny and not being idle, it has a particularly Buddhist subtext
in as much as Mitacintin saves the lives of the other two fish, thereby
avoiding the spectre of death and reinforcing the merits of selfless
compassion. Furthermore, the Buddhist concern for mind (one thinks,
for example, of ‘mindfulness’) is stressed by the use of cintin in each
of the names. This version indicates the amount to which a fable
might be altered for its context. The variation between the (cid:2)DhP and
the Pa(cid:9)catantra, however, is on a more subtle level.
While the general thematic intersection of the fable with the (cid:2)DhP
is evident in any of its versions—even if the J(cid:2)taka version, with its
lack of any significant political content, displays this to a lesser ex-
tent—it is on the level of rhetoric that the text is especially anchored
within the (cid:2)DhP, a rhetoric founded especially on the names of the
fish. While all the names of the fish differ from one version to an-
other, it is especially the name of the third fish that I want to draw at-
tention to here. In many respects it is upon this name and the vice that
it represents that the (cid:2)DhP grounds the fable. This is made clear in the
opening stanza of the chapter (135.1), which describes the concern of
this (cid:2)khy(cid:2)na as, ‘procrastinating in regard to what should and should
not be done’ (d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)traü … k(cid:2)ry(cid:2)k(cid:2)ryavini(cid:3)caye),176 and again in
the first verse of the following chapter (136.1) in which Yudhiùñhira
also acknowledges SU 8’s ‘lesson’ in terms of d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra. The text
of the (cid:2)DhP, therefore, seems to consistently frame the tale in terms
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
173 Cf. Olivelle, The Pa(cid:9)catantra, pp.xxi-ii (and n.24), 170.
174 Despite their formal and verbal differences, the Pa(cid:9)catantra and Hitopade(cid:3)a
versions are similar enough to be treated together.
175 There is, for example, a slight difference in the manner in which the second fish
escapes.
176 In this instance the word d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra refers both to the character ‘D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra’
and the moral he demonstrates. The two cannot be separated.
246 CHAPTER SIX
of d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra,177 though, as we will see, it is not the only way in
which this text is framed.
D(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra is usually translated as ‘procrastinating’ or ‘slow’. It is
made up, of course, of two elements, d(cid:5)rgha, ‘long’, and s(cid:6)tra, which
literally means ‘thread’, but can suggest verbal deliberation. The sense
‘long-winded’, therefore, may not be far off the mark. In n(cid:5)ti contexts,
the absence of d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra is often mentioned as a royal virtue. In KA
6.1.3 one of the excellences of the king is said to be ad(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra ‘not
procrastinating’.178 In Mbh 2.5.96, N(cid:3)rada asks Yudhiùñhira if he
avoids the ‘fourteen vices of the king’ among which is d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra;
and in 5.33.66 Vidura also tells Dh(cid:7)tar(cid:3)ùtra that it is one of six vices to
be avoided. Such associations with kingship and duty are raised in
crucial situations with both Duryodhana and Yudhiùñhira. In 5.122.21
K(cid:7)ùõa demands that Duryodhana not procrastinate and follow the ‘best
advice’ (i.e. not go to war); and earlier, in 3.239.4, after the failed cat-
tle expedition, a humiliated Duryodhana, who wants to starve himself
to death, is told by (cid:6)akuni that (cid:3)r(cid:5) (‘royal prosperity’) is not bestowed
upon a king who ‘procrastinates’. The juxtaposition of the inactive
king befuddled by responsibility, and the active king who readily as-
sumes his duties to rule and be a warrior, is common, and is tied to the
theme that a king is responsible for taking control of the course of
events.179 It should be no surprise, then, given Yudhiùñhira’s character
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
177 Note, by way of contrast, the varying names for the second fish in the (cid:2)DhP,
and the rhetoric used in 136.2 to impart the morals the first and second fish portray
(an(cid:2)gat(cid:2) and utpann(cid:2)), which once again varies from the names of the fish, and have
a striking similarity to the names of the fish in the Pa(cid:9)catantra/Hitopade(cid:3)a versions
(see table in FIGURE 9). In 135.19, in which Bh(cid:8)ùma reiterates the moral demonstrated
by D(cid:8)rghadar(cid:5)in, he even uses the compound an(cid:2)gatavidh(cid:2)na, a direct cognate, of
course, of an(cid:2)gatavidh(cid:2)t(cid:8). It is only d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra which consistently occurs in each
context. Further supportive evidence for the primacy of d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra comes from an
additional verse found in some manuscripts (and Kinjawadekar’s edition) at the be-
ginning of the chapter, which provides a very brief précis of the story, introducing the
three fish and relating their destinies. The two survivor fish are given the names as
they are found in the Pa(cid:9)catantra, while the last fish is still called D(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra. (In
fact, this last verse is much the same as a verse in Hitopade(cid:3)a 4.5, except that in the
latter Yadbhaviùya is substituted for D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra. This cannot be for metrical reasons,
since Yadbhaviùya and D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra share a common metre.)
178 Furthermore, a number of our themes are brought together in KA 6.1.6: … (cid:2)pat-
prak(cid:8)tyor viniyokt(cid:2) d(cid:5)rghad(cid:6)radar(cid:3)(cid:5) de(cid:3)ak(cid:2)lapuruùak(cid:2)rak(cid:2)ryapradh(cid:2)naþ …, a king
should be ‘able to take charge in normal times or crises, take the long and far view,
and have as his principal objective what should be done with proper human effort at
the right place and time’. So closely does this text bring together the themes of the tale
in 12.136 that it again raises the question of the relationship between the two texts.

traits, to find occasions where he too is accused of being d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra.
Bh(cid:8)ma berates Yudhiùñhira in Mbh 3.49.19 for being a procrastinator
when he agrees to the P(cid:3)õóavas’ thirteen years exile, rather than im-
mediately attacking Duryodhana; and when, after the war is won,
Yudhiùñhira declares his intention to renounce, Arjuna asks ‘where is
the kingdom of an impotent man, or a procrastinator?’180
If the problem of d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra, therefore, has a special relevance for
the proper undertaking of a ruler’s responsibilities, it should come as
no surprise that d(cid:5)rghas(cid:6)tra is precisely one of the elements which
defined the king in distress in SU 2 ((cid:2)DhP 129), in the very opening
to the (cid:2)DhP.181 It is a credible possibility, therefore, that this unit has
been designed to respond to an issue opened up by a pra(cid:3)na in SU 2.
One might even say that this tale has been optimised for its context. It
also points to a suggestion that has been made already, that the
pra(cid:3)nas from the three first units ((cid:2)DhP 128-130) are critical in estab-
lishing the semantic parameters of many of the following texts.
A similar dynamic occurs in Bh(cid:8)ùma’s concluding statement (CS)
to the unit. His first three stanzas (135.17-19) reiterate the central
morals contained in the narrative as exemplified in the actions and
names of the three participants. These morals are graded from worst to

best: firstly, if one is ‘unaware’ (na ava+(cid:2)budh) that the right time
has come (pr(cid:2)ptatamaü k(cid:2)laü) (i.e., the moral principally imparted
by Pr(cid:3)ptak(cid:3)laj(cid:9)a), then he dies, like D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra; secondly, if a man
does not ‘in the very beginning’ (adau) organise for his prosperity
((cid:3)reyas) (i.e., the moral imparted by D(cid:8)rghadar(cid:5)in), then his future is
uncertain, like Pr(cid:3)ptak(cid:3)laj(cid:9)a;182 however, if a man creates his ‘future
destiny’ (an(cid:2)gatavidh(cid:2)na—cf. the names in the Pa(cid:9)catantra version),
then he attains prosperity ((cid:3)reyas), like D(cid:8)rghadar(cid:5)in. The operative
terms here have to do with time: D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra was ignorant of time
(k(cid:2)la), Pr(cid:3)ptak(cid:3)laj(cid:9)a did not act ‘in the beginning’ (adau), and D(cid:8)r-
ghadar(cid:5)in was able to firmly establish his future (an(cid:2)gata).
The awareness of the proper time to act is an important theme in
n(cid:5)ti literature, and is frequently coupled with the equally important
notion of the right place (de(cid:3)a) to act. They are, for example, ubiqui-
tous as paired terms in the KA. Bh(cid:8)ùma develops these themes in the
final four stanzas of the unit, providing in 135.20 a ‘catalogue of time’
and then introducing the concept of ‘place’ in 135.21 with the words
p(cid:8)thiv(cid:5) de(cid:3)a ity uktaþ ‘the earth is called the place’. KA 9.1, which
pertains to the king who is about to march (y(cid:2)tr(cid:2)), contains a very
similar sequence of ideas under the prakaraõa ‘understanding the
strength and weakness of power, place and time’ ((cid:3)aktide(cid:3)ak(cid:2)la-
bal(cid:2)balaj(cid:9)(cid:2)nam). KA 9.1.17 briefly states de(cid:3)aþ p(cid:8)thiv(cid:5) ‘the place is
the earth’, which in 9.1.18-19 is followed by a catalogue of the differ-
ent types of land found in the ‘region of the world ruler’ (cakravarti-
kùetra). A similar catalogue, but for ‘time’, occurs in 9.1.22-3. Both
lists are concluded with the same statement: these are the places and
times the king has to work within to bring about an ‘increase in his
own strength’ (svabalav(cid:8)ddhikara) (9.1.20; 24). While the context is a
little different from that of the (cid:2)DhP, such passages have the same
underlying idea. A mastery of the knowledge of ‘time and place’ is
crucial for the royal duty of a king to take control of affairs, to act in a
‘manly’ way, in order to establish prosperity for himself and conse-
quently his kingdom. Thus, Bh(cid:8)ùma concludes, ‘these two are the
principal things declared by the sages in the dharma- and artha-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras and mokùa(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, and are thought of as the masters of love
among men’.183 The whole world view imagined in these texts,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
182 This is precisely D(cid:8)rghadar(cid:5)in’s argument to leave straight away in 135.7.

(cid:3)
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 249
dharma, artha, k(cid:2)ma and mokùa, the principal terms of a Br(cid:3)hmaõism
in transition and an emergent Hinduism, is encapsulated within the
essentially political notions of de(cid:3)ak(cid:2)lau. The person who ‘completely
prepares’ (samyak samupap(cid:2)dayet) for the ‘approaching time and
place’ (de(cid:3)ak(cid:2)lavabhipretau), wins reward (phala). This theme of
‘time and place’ is so well integrated into the political imagination
operating in these texts that it too is clearly anticipated in an earlier
sequence of pra(cid:3)nas. In 128.3 (SU 1), one of the very conditions of a
time of (cid:2)pad is described as being when a king is de(cid:3)ak(cid:2)l(cid:2)vaj(cid:2)nataþ,
‘ignorant of time and place’. This evokes the very similar description
(in stanza 135.17 discussed already above) of D(cid:8)rghas(cid:4)tra as ‘un-
aware’ (na ... avabudh) of the right time to act. It is only with an
awareness of the right place and time that a king can act to restore the
proper order of things (i.e. the proper place and function of the catur-
varga of dharma, artha, k(cid:2)ma and mokùa); and, conversely, its igno-
rance leads him directly to the ‘crisis’ that is his responsibility to
avoid.
6.9 ‘The dialogue between the cat and the mouse’
(Mbh 12.136; SU 9)
The longest text and chapter of the (cid:2)DhP, SU 9 returns to the struc-
ture most common in the didactic sections of the Mbh: an opening
pra(cid:3)na followed by an extensive discourse. Like unit 8, this chapter
consists largely of a fable, ‘the dialogue between the cat and the
mouse’. And, as with the previous fable, scholars consider that this too
has a parallel in the Pa(cid:9)catantra, in this case with the frame story
found in its second tantra.184
A wise mouse called Palita and a cat called Loma(cid:5)a lived in a great
Banyan tree in a forest. A caõó(cid:2)la hunter laid traps at the base of the
tree, one of which ensnared the cat. As a consequence, Palita freely
wandered about. But then a mongoose and an owl, two other enemies of
the mouse, arrived at the tree and he became afraid. Palita suggested
that he and the cat cooperate for their mutual benefit. Loma(cid:5)a agreed
and encouraged Palita to hurry and free him, promising that, after being
freed, he and all his kin will be excellent friends to the mouse. Palita
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
pratipattimanau, but the context clearly makes this unacceptable, especially given the
closing stanza.
184 Falk, Quellen, pp.36-77, following an insight of W. Ruben.
250 CHAPTER SIX
snuggled in to the cat, protecting himself from the mongoose and owl,
and began slowly gnawing through the cat’s bonds. But the cat became
impatient, demanding that Palita hurry to cut the bonds before the
hunter’s return. Palita explained that he must wait until just before the
return of the caõó(cid:2)la, since Loma(cid:5)a would then have to escape into the
tree, leaving no time to capture Palita. The pair debated this strategy,
but the mouse got his way. In the morning the caõó(cid:2)la arrived. The cat
despaired. The owl and mongoose left.185 When his bonds were cut, the
cat ran up the tree. The mouse, also freed from his enemies, entered his
own hollow. And the caõó(cid:2)la left empty handed. Loma(cid:5)a attempted to
convince Palita of his intention to maintain their friendship, promising
that he and his kin will revere Palita and his kin. Palita lectured Loma(cid:5)a
on friendship and self-interest and the proper time for peace and war.
The cat gave in and they went to their respective hollows.
This unit is well integrated both into its immediate context and into
the broader context of the (cid:2)DhP. It is the second of three consecutive
units containing a fable (and the second of five containing some kind
of narrative on the third interlocutory level as described in FIGURE 7
above, cf. FIGURE 8). In these three units, explicit link statements (LS
in FIGURE 8)186 rhetorically connect each with the unit that precedes it
in the sequence. Their thematic coherence further reflects the connec-
tion of the three units. This unit also integrates well into the broader
context of the (cid:2)DhP, made obvious in as much as the principal theme
of (cid:2)pad is implicit in the fable and explicitly cited on a number of oc-
casions (whether as (cid:2)pad or the cognate (cid:2)panna or the synonyms
vyasana, k(cid:8)cchra and viùamastha). Furthermore, this SU contains a
political discourse, the components of which further integrate it into
the overtly political orientation of the (cid:2)DhP.187
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
185 There is a narrative inconsistency here, since the owl and mongoose are said to
have departed twice, first in 136.82 and then again in 136.114.
186 These link statements (136.1 referring to 135, and 137.1 referring to 136) are
more explicit than most others, which tend to be merely discourse markers. See dis-
cussion above p.182.

252 CHAPTER SIX
Further strategies of integration are evident in a certain ‘rhetorical
echo’ which stanza 136.12 (the first of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s intial statement (IS)
in this unit) establishes with a sequence of ideas already found in
RDhP 128.5 and 7:188
tvadyukto ’yam anupra(cid:3)no yudhiùñhira guõodayaþ|
(cid:3)(cid:8)õu me putra k(cid:2)rtsnyena guhyam (cid:2)patsu bh(cid:2)rata||
This additional question is appropriate to you, Yudhiùñhira, and results
from your good qualities. Listen to me in full, son, about the secret for
crises, Bh(cid:3)rata.
This stanza brings together two ideas already mentioned in the two
earlier stanzas: the idea of Yudhiùñhira’s questions being supplemental
or secondary (anupra(cid:3)na), and the idea that what will be taught here is
a ‘secret’ (guhyam). Both ideas suggest something of the problematic
nature of the discourse they describe. The question is supplementary
because it should not be of first resort, and the teaching is a secret be-
cause it should be used with acute judgement and only when politi-
cally necessary.
The political discourse presented in this unit can be analysed in
terms of six closely interrelated themes:
1. What to do when surrounded by enemies
2. The proper identification of friends and enemies.
3. The relationship between the weak and the strong.
4. The right time and place to act.
5. The appropriate pursuance of peace or war/when to overcome an en-
emy.
6. The knowledge of when to trust or not to trust.
The table in FIGURE 10, which maps the distribution of these themes
across the SU, shows how they are repeatedly raised both in the outer
frame of this unit (on the interlocutory level encompassing Bh(cid:8)ùma
and Yudhiùñhira) and during the actual narrative of the fable itself. It
must be kept in mind that this table only reflects the distribution of the
themes of the text in a mechanical way, not matching their more or-
ganic presentation in the text itself. Some of these themes are implicit
in the whole fable, since the actual situation described in the narrative
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
188 See above pp.192ff. and 197ff. respectively.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 253
embodies or enacts the particular issues some themes address (this, for
example, is especially so for themes 1 and 3). Others are more explic-
itly treated. The point of the table is to indicate that themes first intro-
duced in the frame of the text by both Yudhiùñhira and Bh(cid:8)ùma, are
then developed in the tale by Palita and Loma(cid:5)a (Palita being the prin-
cipal interlocutor in the dialogue), and finally summarised by Bh(cid:8)ùma
in his CS, where he delivers a summary (saükùepa) of the principal
messages of the fable.189 These themes are discussed in more detail in
the following.
1. WHAT TO DO WHEN SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES. This theme is im-
plicit in most of the narrative, at least until the departure of the owl
and mongoose. It is also clearly implicated in the pra(cid:3)nas that open
SUs 1 and 2.190 In political terms, the problem of being surrounded by
enemies is a typical instance of crisis ((cid:2)pad). But in many ways it is
also typical of the normal state of affairs, especially as it is conceived
in a model like the maõóala theory where a king is surrounded on all
sides by alternating circles of allies and enemies.191 There is clearly
some verbal resonance between the frame and narrative portions of
this text in the treatment of this theme. Note, for example, the continu-
ity of ideas and language evident in 136.6, 41 and 73, 136.13, 132 and
156, and 136.17, 59 and 135-9 respectively. Such verbal resonance
suggests a consistency in composition between the frame and the
‘text’ it embeds.192
2. THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES. Key terms:
mitra, amitra, (cid:3)atru, sakhi, ripu, ari. This theme concerns the prob-
lems of how to distinguish friends from enemies, to recognise when a
friend has become an enemy and vice versa, and to understand the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
189 We could further add Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)nas in the first three stanzas of the fol-
lowing chapter (SU 10), where he acknowledges the lesson in terms of ‘trust’ (or,
rather, the importance of ‘not trusting’), which in turn provide the impetus for the
narration contained therein.
190 See pp.190ff. and 211ff.
191 See p.72 n.131 above. Does (cid:3)atrumaõóala in the last stanza of (cid:2)DhP 136 imply
the maõóala theory?
192 Other examples are found in the use of viùamastha in 136.5, 40 and 152, which
here is a synonym for (cid:2)pad and is otherwise rare in the (cid:6)P, and in the close resonance
of 136.6 and 136.192, which makes the latter sound like a recapitulative response to
the former.
254 CHAPTER SIX
limitations of friendship. ‘Friend’, of course, is used because of the
intimate context of the fable, and should be understood in the political
sense of ‘ally’. This theme has much in common with theme number
five concerning ‘peace and war’. The general sense is that a person is
an ‘ally’ or an ‘enemy’ depending on the circumstances (s(cid:2)marthya-
yog(cid:2)t, s(cid:2)marthya) and due to their utility value (arthayukti).193 Once
again, these general concerns are clearly foreshadowed in the pra(cid:3)nas
of the opening couple of units discussed above,194 pointing again to the
substantial role these pra(cid:3)nas have in setting the parameters for dis-
cussions of (cid:2)pad (and (cid:2)paddharma) in the units which follow them.
3. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WEAK AND THE STRONG KING.
Key terms: durbala, abalavat, balavat, balin, bal(cid:5)yas, mah(cid:2)bala. As
discussed already,195 this theme is ubiquitous in the KA. It is also an
important condition for classifying a time as (cid:2)pad as described in ear-
lier units of the (cid:2)DhP. In this narrative, the relationship is often ex-
pressed in terms of food: the stronger cat Loma(cid:5)a is the natural ‘eater’
of the natural ‘food’, the mouse Palita (136.160).196 This is not just
because this describes the ‘world’ of cats and mice, but also because it
reflects what Francis Zimmermann has called the ‘Hindu chain of
foods’,197 an image frequently projected in ancient Indian texts. We
have already encountered something like this idea in the conception of
anarchy, i.e., what is often described as the ‘law of the fishes’, where
the bigger eat the smaller. But, in political terms, the condition where
the stronger eat the weaker is also the normal state of affairs, only
forestalled when the king properly performs his duty.198 This is why
the ‘law of the fishes’ is often associated with kingless states. It is
Palita’s intelligence which makes it possible for him to overcome his
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
193 For the former idea, see 136.13, 132 (=138.51), 156; for the latter, see 136.17,
59, 135-9.
194 Note the concern for ‘enemies’ and ‘allies’ in the pra(cid:3)nas of SUs 1 & 2 on
pp.191 and 211 above.
195 See above p.71.
196 A similar idea is expressed with similar wording in the Pa(cid:9)catantra. See Edger-
ton’s edition 2.9; tr. Olivelle, The Pa(cid:9)catantra, p.75 (cf. p.xxxvi for similar examples
in the Pa(cid:9)catantra).
197 The Jungle, pp.1-2, 206-7.
198 This is one of the important points Arjuna makes in his discussion of daõóa
when trying to convince Yudhiùñhira to assume the kingship in an early passage of the
(cid:6)P, see especially 15.20-1, 30, 36 (partly discussed above p.143 and p.241 n.163). On
the ‘law of the fish’ see above p.52 n.49.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 255
stronger enemies; but, notably, this does not remove the danger of
these enemies, which is always present.
4. THE RIGHT TIME AND PLACE TO ACT. Key terms: k(cid:2)la, ak(cid:2)la,
(de(cid:3)a+)k(cid:2)la+(cid:2)j(cid:9)a/(cid:2)vid, pr(cid:2)ptak(cid:2)la, k(cid:2)l(cid:2)t(cid:5)ta, k(cid:2)l(cid:2)k(cid:2)ïkùin. This con-
tinues one of the important themes from the previous unit. Indeed,
Yudhiùñhira acknowledges the lesson of SU 8 in precisely these terms
in the first stanza of the current unit. This theme is typically presented
here only in terms of time (k(cid:2)la), the pairing of de(cid:3)a and k(cid:2)la occur-
ring just twice, in 136.14 and 83. The former (in Bh(cid:8)ùma’s IS) closely
evokes the sentiment of the previous chapter.199 The predominance of
k(cid:2)la over k(cid:2)lade(cid:3)a here does not, however, affect the thematic conti-
guity of the two units. It is Palita’s awareness of the right time to act,
in utilising the threat of the trapper to his own advantage, which en-
ables him to avoid capture by Loma(cid:5)a.
5. THE APPROPRIATE PURSUANCE OF PEACE AND WAR/WHEN TO OVER-
COME AN ENEMY. Key terms: saüdhi, vigraha, saü+(cid:2)dh(cid:2), s(cid:2)ntva,
saügati, sam(cid:2)gama, abhi+saü+(cid:2)dh(cid:2). This theme was addressed also
in 12.129 (SU 2), and is frequently found in the context of discussions
of ‘friends (allies)’ and ‘enemies’. One must know when it is ap-
propriate to create an alliance with an enemy, and similarly when to
dissolve such an alliance. The same goes in reverse for allies. Palita,
of course, demonstrates this theme by his negotiations with Loma(cid:5)a,
and by the strategy he adopts to alleviate their mutual crisis ((cid:2)pad).
6. THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHEN TO TRUST OR NOT TO TRUST. Key terms:
vi+(cid:2)(cid:3)vas, (a)vi(cid:3)vasta, (a)vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)sa, (cid:2)+(cid:2)(cid:3)vas. In many respects, this
theme is the most original contribution SU 9 makes to the (cid:2)DhP,
since it has not been explicitly raised in the parvan until now. The is-
sue of whether to be trusting or not trusting is clearly related to the
problems of distinguishing friends from enemies, how to behave to-
wards friends or enemies, and understanding the proper time for war.
Significantly, the text seems to present this theme as the principal an-

swer to Yudhiùñhira’s opening queries, and it figures prominently in
the latter part of the unit, especially in the last speech of Palita to
Loma(cid:5)a (183-9), and in Bh(cid:8)ùma’s CS (see table in FIGURE 10 above).
It is also in these terms that Yudhiùñhira acknowledges the lesson of
this unit in the first line of SU 10, which then pursues the theme fur-
ther. Sometimes the sense is that one should behave duplicitously, as
when Bh(cid:8)ùma tells Yudhiùñhira to be untrusting ‘as if trusting’.200
Stanza 136.187 underlines the significance of this teaching:
saükùepo n(cid:5)ti(cid:3)(cid:2)str(cid:2)õ(cid:2)m avi(cid:3)v(cid:2)saþ paro mataþ|
n(cid:8)ùu tasm(cid:2)d avi(cid:3)v(cid:2)saþ puùkalaü hitam (cid:2)tmanaþ||
Distrust is considered the best epitome of the teachings on politics.
Therefore, for oneself, distrust in regard to men is thoroughly benefi-
cial.
As this thematic analysis indicates, this SU clearly relates a political
discourse. But what of dharma? How does it fit into this picture of
expediency? Curiously enough, dharma is almost entirely absent from
this unit. Yet, while any tension here between dharma and the n(cid:5)ti
path Palita has outlined is understated, a tension is still revealed in
subtle variations in the discourse between the cat and mouse. Apart
from Yudhiùñhira’s description of Bh(cid:8)ùma as dharm(cid:2)rthaku(cid:3)ala in
136.3, dharma does not occur until Loma(cid:5)a’s last ditch effort to estab-
lish an ongoing relationship between himself and the mouse in stanzas
136.177-81. In these stanzas, Loma(cid:5)a twice uses the word dharma in a
way striking because of its complete absence up until this point.
Loma(cid:5)a flatters Palita (177), and attempts to shift to a different regis-
ter from the terms of debate as the mouse has thus far defined them.
He calls Palita s(cid:2)dhu (178, 180), ‘righteous, good’, the first time he is
referred to in such a way201 (and, as we have seen, the notion of s(cid:2)dhu
frequently has particular affinities with dharma202), and introduces a
new, more moral tone (136.179):

bh(cid:2)va, ‘the dual policy’ found in the KA and elsewhere, see Botto, “Dvaidh(cid:8)bh(cid:3)va,”
pp.46-56.
201 Epithets evoking Palita’s political wisdom are more common.
202 E.g. see above pp.197 and 219. Loma(cid:5)a evoked the notion of the s(cid:2)dhu once
before in 136.96, where he chastised Palita for having an ambiguous attitude towards
‘friends’.

He beseeches Palita not to shun him, ‘you ought to not suspect me as
[your] death’ (maraõaü … na m(cid:2)ü (cid:3)aïkitum arhasi), calling Palita at
the same time a ‘knower of the truth of dharma’ (dharmatattvaj(cid:9)a).203
Loma(cid:5)a’s rhetoric asks Palita to consider his course of conduct in
terms other than the strictly political discourse he has repeatedly out-
lined to this point, to wonder about other virtues than mere survival.
Palita, however, will have none of it. Perhaps ironically, in 136.183 he
too calls Loma(cid:5)a s(cid:2)dhu, but declares his lack of trust in him (na …
vi(cid:3)vase); he will not again be overcome ‘with praises or heaps of
wealth’ (saüstavair v(cid:2) dhanaughair).
A similar tension is present too when we return to the outer frame
occupied by Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira. The entire teaching of the
saüv(cid:2)da is placed firmly within the sphere of kùatradharma in the
opening stanza of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s CS (136.194),204 which is followed by a
summary of the themes of the saüv(cid:2)da in 136.195-206. Bh(cid:8)ùma then
makes a statement that seems an attempt to forestall any concerns
Yudhiùñhira might have about the content of the teaching (136.207):
aviruddh(cid:2)ü trivargeõa n(cid:5)tim et(cid:2)ü yudhiùñhira|
abhyuttiùñha (cid:3)rut(cid:2)d asm(cid:2)d bh(cid:6)yas tvaü ra(cid:9)jayan praj(cid:2)þ||
Yudhiùñhira, you must adopt this political wisdom which is consistent
with the set of three [i.e., dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma]; by learning it you
will gratify your people even more.
Minoru Hara has pointed out that the last two padas of this stanza
echo the folk etymology of r(cid:2)jan from the verb (cid:2)ra(cid:9)j.205 As with
many folk etymologies, this reveals something about the nature of the
word it describes. The king (r(cid:2)jan) ‘delights’ or ‘gratifies’ ((cid:2)ra(cid:9)j) his
people because of his political learning, which is ‘consistent with
dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma’ (i.e. almost all important knowledge in re-
spect to the br(cid:3)hmaõic world view). This contingent, expedient under-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

204 This echoes Palita’s earlier description of his strategy as kùatravidy(cid:2) in 136.42.

258 CHAPTER SIX
standing of allies, trust and so on, is essentially his dharma, which can
only keep at arms length any absolutist understanding of dharma or
morality. As Palita understands only too well, when it comes to poli-
tics, any such conception is a weakness that can only lead to capture;
which, when transposed to the world of kings, means the dissolution
of the kingdom, and the decline of dharma.
6.10 ‘The dialogue between P(cid:6)jan(cid:5) and Brahmadatta’
(Mbh 12.137; SU 10)
Like the previous two units, this SU also contains a fable found in
other sources.206 The ‘dialogue between P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) and Brahmadatta’ is a
simple tale which provides the basis for an extensive discussion be-
tween the two protagonists. Besides Yudhiùñhira’s opening pra(cid:3)nas,
which orient this unit both thematically and in relation to its context in
the (cid:2)DhP, the frame is relatively unobtrusive. This may be due to the
highly didactic nature of the dialogue in the saüv(cid:2)da itself. Indeed,
the unit is more like a didactic monologue delivered by P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) to
Brahmadatta. While the tale comes to a close in the second last stanza
(137.108), when the bird finally departs after the long intervening dis-
cussion, most of the ‘narrative’ aspects of the fable are related be-
tween verses 4 and 20:
There was a bird called P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) (‘Honourable’) who had lived for a long
time in the palace of a king called Brahmadatta. P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) and the king’s
wife gave birth to sons at the same time. P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) became the nurse of the
king’s son. She took the children to the seashore and fed them fruit that
made the king’s son strong and vigorous. One day, while playing, the
young prince kills her son. Returning from gathering more fruit, P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)
is horrified to see her child dead. Deeply distressed, she curses kùatriyas
as untrustworthy. P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) seeks revenge on the king’s son, cutting his
eyes with her claws. Arguing that this has made them even, the king
tries to convince her to remain in his kingdom. But P(cid:4)jan(cid:8), convinced
that a feud has begun, insists that she must depart. After a long debate,
and despite the king’s protestations, P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) leaves the kingdom.

This and the brief J(cid:2)taka version clearly bear some kind of relationship. In the J(cid:2)taka,
g(cid:2)thas 165-8 show close similarities to (cid:2)DhP 136.30-3. The Harivaü(cid:3)a version has
been relegated to no.5 in the appendix by the editors of the CE. Belvalkar notes that
Benfey’s Pantschatantra (pp.561-70) contains a version as well. I have been unable to
consult this source.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 259
This text develops a theme raised in SU 9 ((cid:2)DhP 136), the need for a
king to be always wary of trusting anyone. Some kind of composi-
tional relationship between the two units seems quite likely.207 Yudhi-
ùñhira’s opening pra(cid:3)nas to this unit have obviously been composed
with (cid:2)DhP 136 in view, directly drawing a connection between the
two. While Yudhiùñhira understands the need not to trust enemies (na
vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)so ’sti (cid:3)atruùu), he wonders how a king can do anything while
trusting no one, and indeed how a king can even defeat his enemies
(137.1-2). This problem underpins much of the unit, though the saü-
v(cid:2)da introduces other issues of interest as well. This thematic and rhe-
torical link is quite important in grounding this text in the (cid:2)DhP, since
this text does not pursue its concerns in terms of (cid:2)pad (or in similar
expressions), as one might expect, though the circumstances described
in the text can obviously be understood as a ‘situation of distress’.
After the narrative of the fable has been related, the more overtly
didactic portion of the unit follows a fairly clear trajectory:
21-30(cid:3) P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) makes her case for why she must leave. Her son’s mur-
der by the king’s son and P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s act of revenge have created the con-
ditions of a feud (vaira, k(cid:8)tavaira, anyonyak(cid:8)tavaira). In such a situa-
tion trust (vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)sa) between people can not exist. Since there is no pos-
sibility for reconciliation, and no trust, then Brahmadatta’s kingdom is
no longer a suitable home for P(cid:4)jan(cid:8).
31-44(cid:3) Brahmadatta argues that since P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) has avenged his son’s
wrong their relationship can continue as before. Affection between
them will stir again through cohabitation (36-7). But P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) maintains
that the initial reason for the feud will never be forgotten, and will rise
up again. She reiterates that she can no longer trust the king as she once
did, and therefore must go.
45-70(cid:3) Brahmadatta introduces a new theme (45-9): fate or time (k(cid:2)la)
is responsible for all activity, and especially the distribution of happi-
ness and sadness (sukha and duþkha). P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) ridicules this, since then
there would be no point for anyone to do anything. However, what is
unavoidable is the hostility between them. Because she hurt the king’s
son, inevitably he will strike back at her. Rather than sadness being the
result of fate, everyone desires happiness (sukha) and avoids misery
(duþkha); ‘distrusting’ the king is P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s path to happiness.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
207 Sometimes there seems to be a close rhetorical relationship: 137.25ab occurs at
136.138ab and 138.43ab (the whole of 136.138 is found also at Mbh 5.38.9); and the
rare compound anyonyak(cid:8)tavaira is found at 136.195, 137.27 and 37 (cf. 137.23).
260 CHAPTER SIX
71-84(cid:3) P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) counters Brahmadatta’s argument concerning the forces
of fate (k(cid:2)la, daiva) by opposing them to puruùak(cid:2)ra, human activity.
To not change circumstances which are obviously harmful is stupid;
conversely, everyone pursues things which make them happy.
85-91(cid:3) Where there is suffering one should leave and go somewhere
else. ‘There is no happiness in a bad kingdom, and one cannot live in a
bad place.’208
92-107(cid:3) P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) describes the characteristics of a good king and a king-
dom where the inhabitants are happy.
Unlike the previous unit, which merely presented the need for the king
‘to not be trusting’ of allies or enemies, this unit deals with this prob-
lem from a twofold perspective. The weak, female bird P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) in-
structs the king Brahmadatta in both the realities of kingship and his
own royal failings. The inversion of roles adds intensity to her
speech,209 for a significant subtext to this unit is the tension between
the king’s responsibilities towards his subjects and the kùatriya’s (not
always) latent potential for violence. This potential is expressed by
P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) when she discovers her dead son and exclaims (137.13-14):
kùatriye saügataü n(cid:2)sti na pr(cid:5)tir na ca sauh(cid:8)dam|
k(cid:2)raõe saübhajant(cid:5)ha k(cid:8)t(cid:2)rth(cid:2)þ saütyajanti ca||
kùatriyeùu na vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)saþ k(cid:2)ryaþ sarvopagh(cid:2)tiùu|
apak(cid:8)ty(cid:2)pi satataü s(cid:2)ntvayanti nirarthakam||
No intimacy, no affection and no friendship exists in a kùatriya! They
participate in an activity and, their goal accomplished, they leave. One
shouldn’t trust kùatriyas, they injure everyone! And always acting mali-
ciously, they conciliate meaninglessly!
In a similar fashion to the previous text of the (cid:2)DhP, this unit presents
a political argument about the traps of being too trusting. Yet, it also
adds a further dimension by exploring the limits to this theme, espe-
cially in this narrative’s important subtext of the king’s proper rela-
tionship to his subjects, where distrust is destructive. In this respect,
P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) makes an interesting statement which evokes the notion that
hostility is the normal way of the world, a notion found also in the
previous chapter (137.56):
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
208 137.90cd kur(cid:2)jye nirv(cid:8)tir n(cid:2)sti kude(cid:3)e na praj(cid:5)vyate||
209 The fable is aware of P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s anomalous status, describing her in 137.6cd as
‘omniscient, knowing all dharma, even though she had been born an animal’ (sarva-
j(cid:9)(cid:2) sarvadharmaj(cid:9)(cid:2) tiryagyonigat(cid:2)pi s(cid:2)).

Men pursue birds for the sake of food or sport. Besides death or capture
there is no third relationship possible.
The lack of self restraint displayed by the king’s son is evidence of the
king’s failure to establish a stable kingdom which wards off anarchy,
typically construed as a situation where the stronger consume the
weaker.210 P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) argues that everyone desires happiness (sukha), and
wants to avoid misery (duþkha), and since ‘they who know the artha-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras’ have determined that ‘suspicion results in happiness’ (avi-
(cid:3)v(cid:2)saþ sukhodayaþ), she can therefore no longer trust the king. The
implication is that, at any time, he may lose his self-control, and self-
control is a necessary prerequisite for a good king because of his great
power and violent nature.
On the one hand, as the weaker of the two participants in a situation
of hostility, P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s crisis reflects a political reality, where ‘distrust’
serves an important role in establishing her security. On the other
hand, as the subject of the king (and a ‘weak’ and noble subject at
that), P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s situation problematises the issue of ‘trust’ and ‘distrust’
by posing the question of the proper limits to the king’s pursuit of this
ethic. The former case is reflected in the dramatic situation of the fa-
ble. P(cid:4)jan(cid:8) embodies the weak political entity who must negotiate her
survival with a strong political entity when hostility has arisen be-
tween them. ‘Distrust’ in this case has a pragmatic end. The political
language employed to portray this dramatic situation further under-
scores this aspect.211 In the second case, the king must know when,
and towards whom, to ferment distrust; for the maintenance of the
kingdom depends upon it. P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s misery (duþkha) and grief are ex-
pressive of Brahmadatta’s failure in this regard. This explains why the
unit ends with a description of the conditions of both a bad and good
kingdom. Brahmadatta has failed to perform his responsibilities as a
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

211 E.g. the potential and proper time for peace, (cid:2)s(cid:2)ntv (14, 22, 34, 41, 69), saüdhi
(27, 64-5), s(cid:2)man (35); the proper recognition of allies, suh(cid:8)d (40), sauh(cid:8)d, (13, 89,
91); the need to take control of one’s destiny, puruùak(cid:2)ra (72-80). The latter is espe-
cially interesting. As seen already, puruùak(cid:2)ra is a particularly royal attribute.
Brahmadatta’s failings are underlined by his reliance on an argument based on fate
(daiva, k(cid:2)la), since, as king, he especially should take control of events.
262 CHAPTER SIX
king, kùatriyas have not shown the proper self-restraint212 that enables
‘trust’ to develop between the ruling class and the subjects. The war-
rior’s ‘natural’ hostility has been misplaced. As so often in the Mbh,
this unit poses the question of the proper application of power. A
situation of (cid:2)pad heightens the tensions inherent in this problem, since
it is then that a king or warrior must perform duties which threaten to
undo the self-restraint that is equally necessary for a stable kingdom.
6.11 ‘The dialogue between Kaõiïka and (cid:7)atruütapa’
(12.138; SU 11)
Like the previous unit, this dialogue between the king (cid:6)atruütapa and
the sage Kaõiïka Bharadv(cid:3)ja takes the form of a monologue rather
than a dialogue, with (cid:6)atruütapa responsible only for the opening
pra(cid:3)na in 138.5. A version of the same text is also found in the (cid:4)di-
parvan, though it has been omitted from main text of the Critical Edi-
tion.213 The two versions have much in common, with thirty-four
verses being either very similar or exactly the same,214 though their
order differs markedly in each version, perhaps reflecting the com-
posite nature of the texts. This text is often cited for the rather extreme
views the sage teaches.215
This text is clearly a composite of disparate elements. Within the
n(cid:5)ti/artha framework established in the unit’s frame, it is also eclectic,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
212 This ethic underlies the whole fable. The young prince’s lack of restraint is the
catalyst for P(cid:4)jan(cid:8)’s departure. Self-restraint is valorised in 137.84.
213 Star passage no. 81 in appendix 1. In the (cid:4)diparvan the name of the sage is
given as Kaõika. Indeed, there seems considerable doubt over the form his name
should take (see notes to the CE). On the two versions, see also M. Biardeau,

Etudes, Section des Sciences Religieuses, 78 (1970-1), pp.153-6.

covering a diverse range of material. Indicative of this composite na-
ture is the number of elements in the text found both elsewhere in the
Mbh and in other texts from related genres. These are shown in the
table in FIGURE 11. This table only accounts for elements exhibiting
an identical or extremely close verbal and semantic similarity. There
are still more cases where just the sense is reflected. For example,
stanzas 138.15 and 33 respectively echo (cid:2)DhP 136.131 and 200,
which is indicative of the sometimes close relationship between these
two texts (as the evidence presented in the table attests). Stanza
138.29, which concerns the importance of a proper understanding of
the right time to act, and of the relative strengths of the king and his
enemy, has a close parallel in Mbh 3.29.31, and is further reflected in
the topic of an entire prakaraõa in KA 9.1.216 (cid:2)DhP 138.64, a close
RDhP parallel of which is indicated in the table, is further echoed in
RDhP 103.33, MS 7.140 and KA 1.4.8-10. The simile used in 138.18d
is used in a similar fashion in (cid:2)DhP 137.69d, and is found also in
RDhP 96.21d and KA 7.3.5. The relationship between (cid:2)DhP 138 and
spatially proximate material in (cid:2)DhP 136, 137 and 139, points to the
possibility that the collators of the text were deeply conscious of the
context in which it is now found; and the repeated parallels found be-
tween (cid:2)DhP 138 and Mbh 3.29 and 5.38, RDhP 104 and MS 7.99-
106, also suggest some kind of obscure consistency in the selection of
the included material. Curiously, a number of these elements are not
found in the (cid:4)diparvan version (138.5, 15cd, 25, 51, 64-7). Among
these, the parallels within the (cid:2)DhP itself especially point to the pos-
sibility that the text has been ‘optimised’ for its current context.
A similarity this text shares with the previous unit is the relative
absence of the Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira frame. Once introduced, Kaõiïka,
the chief protagonist, takes over the text from 138.7 until 138.69.
Bh(cid:8)ùma provides the final stanza, though it adds little to the overall
text. Despite the brevity of the opening sections of the frame
(Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na in 138.1 and Bh(cid:8)ùma’s opening statements in
138.2-4) they are not without significance. While (cid:6)atruütapa’s pra(cid:3)na
in 138.5, which we shall turn to shortly, provides the specific
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
216 The title of this prakaraõa (KA 9.1.1-33, prakaraõa 135) is given in KA
1.1.11a as (cid:3)aktide(cid:3)ak(cid:2)labal(cid:2)balaj(cid:9)(cid:2)nam. Cf. KA 9.1.1. In this prakaraõa the king
must ascertain this information ((cid:3)akti etc.) in order to decide if it is appropriate to
march against his enemy or remain still.
264 CHAPTER SIX
n(cid:5)ti/artha framework of Kaõiïka’s teaching, Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na ori-
ents the embedded text in a very general way (138.1):
yugakùay(cid:2)t parikù(cid:5)õe dharme loke ca bh(cid:2)rata|
dasyubhiþ p(cid:5)óyam(cid:2)ne ca kathaü stheyaü pit(cid:2)maha||
When dharma and the world are in decline in consequence of the yuga
coming to an end, and when bandits oppress them [dharma and loka],
grandfather, how can one stand firm?
Yudhiùñhira gives two characterisations of the causes or symptoms217
of a time of distress ((cid:2)pad), which itself is indicated by the decay of
dharma and loka: the end of a yuga and the oppression perpetrated by
dasyus. The former, a paradigmatic mythic representation of a time of
(cid:2)pad, a representation which we shall already briefly encountered in
the pra(cid:3)nas opening (cid:2)DhP 130 (SU 3)218 and which we shall encoun-
ter again in the following unit, provides a cosmic context for the
teachings that follow. By placing the text in this cosmic frame, the
contents of the text are also justified in terms of cosmic stability. The
second characterisation frames the text in terms of social decay, also
one of the principal representations of (cid:2)pad to which the authors of
the (cid:2)DhP continually return. From the br(cid:3)hmaõic point of view, the
rising threat of bandits and the decay of br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma are two
events that go hand in hand.
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial statements provide a political framework for the
saüv(cid:2)da. He will explain (138.2) ‘political conduct in times of dis-
tress’ (n(cid:5)tim (cid:2)patsu) by relating a saüv(cid:2)da which concerns the ‘settled
opinion regarding artha’ (138.4). This political framework is further
articulated in (cid:6)atruütapa’s pra(cid:3)na—which functionally mirrors the
pra(cid:3)nas delivered by Yudhiùñhira on the interlocutory level that en-
compasses it—providing the impetus and thematic grounding for the
ensuing lesson. It is more specific than Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na, and
makes up for some of the deficiencies of that question in directing the
attention of the reader or audience (138.5):
alabdhasya kathaü lips(cid:2) labdhaü kena vivardhate|
vardhitaü p(cid:2)layet kena p(cid:2)litaü praõayet katham||
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
217 The difference between cause and symptom is not always clear: are the dasyus
opportunistic, taking advantage of another’s distress, or do they cause the distress?
Typically, this text does not clearly distinguish between causes due to ‘fate’ and
causes due to human activity.

This pra(cid:3)na is an adaptation of a common n(cid:5)ti formula found in simi-
lar forms in other texts,219 and it firmly grounds the text in this familiar
context. We will return to this pra(cid:3)na shortly.
Kaõiïka begins his response by extolling the virtues of the king’s
daõóa, his rod of force or punishment symbolising his power (138.7-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
219 KA 1.4.3; MS 7.99, 101; RDhP 59.57; YS 1.317. See also Scharfe, Investiga-
tions, pp.46f. For a similar sentiment with different wording, see (cid:2)DhP 131.2 (dis-
cussed above p.224).
266 CHAPTER SIX
9). The king should ‘raise his rod high’ (udyatadaõóa).220 In many
ways, this is the symbolic epitome of kingly behaviour and, suitably, it
is accompanied by demands that the king act in manly fashion. We
have already seen how Yudhiùñhira is roundly criticised for doing pre-
cisely the opposite, for ‘laying his rod down’ (nyastadaõóa).221 In
stanza 138.12, Kaõiïka introduces the theme of (cid:2)pad. From this point
onwards the text mostly consists of general statements on political
behaviour that often have an aphoristic style,222 giving them the im-
pression of being formulas meant for easy memorisation. Simile is
frequently used, and there is little attempt at subtlety. Sometimes the
teachings touch on practical affairs, such as the discussion of spies in
138.39-42. And at times they take on a gruesome tone, for which the
text is most well known. This tone becomes rather relentless: having
built up trust with an enemy, he should then ‘rush upon him like a
wolf’ (avalumped yath(cid:2) v(cid:8)kaþ) (138.46); even a brother, father or
friend should be killed if he is an ‘obstacle to prosperity’ (arthasya
vighnaü) (138.47); a king should punish even gurus if they are ar-
rogant (138.48); the highest royal splendour (paramaü (cid:3)riyam) cannot
be obtained ‘without having cut away an enemy’s weaknesses’ (n(cid:2)c-
chittv(cid:2) paramarm(cid:2)õi), ‘without performing harsh deeds’ (n(cid:2)k(cid:8)tv(cid:2)
karma d(cid:2)ruõam), or ‘without killing like a fisherman kills’ (n(cid:2)hatv(cid:2)
matsyagh(cid:2)t(cid:5)va) (138.50); ‘and having cut off his enemies head, he
should lament, or even grieve’ (api c(cid:2)sya (cid:3)ira(cid:3) chittv(cid:2) rudy(cid:2)c choced
ath(cid:2)pi v(cid:2)) (138.54); and the ‘utter ruination of an enemy’s kingdom’
(parar(cid:2)ùñraü vin(cid:2)(cid:3)ayet) should be brought about through ‘the slaugh-
ter of its people’ (vadhena … manuùy(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü), the ‘ruining of its roads’
(m(cid:2)rg(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü d(cid:6)ùaõena) and the ‘destruction of its mines’ ((cid:2)kar(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü
vin(cid:2)(cid:3)ai(cid:3)) (138.61).
Let us briefly return to (cid:6)atruütapa’s pra(cid:3)na in 138.5. It is curious
that such an overtly ‘aggressive’ discourse, concerned apparently with
political conduct (n(cid:5)ti) ‘in distress’, is a response to a n(cid:5)ti question as
general as that offered by (cid:6)atruütapa. This suggests a question: what
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
220 It is worth noting that this is contradicted by Kauñilya, who prefers a more mod-
erate position. See KA 1.4.5-10. The KA ascribes the view presented in the (cid:2)DhP
(and MS) to the ‘teachers’ ((cid:2)c(cid:2)rya). His eventual position in 1.4.8-10 mirrors the
language of (cid:2)DhP 138.64-6 (and MS 7.140), though it is a little more subtle than
Kaõiïka’s (or Manu’s for that matter).
221 See above pp.149f.
222 Cf. Biardeau, “Conférence,” p.153: “une suite d’aphorismes dans le plus pur
style du n(cid:5)ti(cid:3)(cid:2)stra”.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 267
is the difference between the types of conduct the king must adopt in
times of distress, from normal political behaviour as conceived in po-
litical texts? That is to say, are the many kinds of ‘distress’ that can
afflict a kingdom—such as war, drought, successionist controversies,
a bad king and so on—really the normal state of affairs for kingdoms
and kings? If this is the case, then one way to understand ‘(cid:2)pad-
dharma for kings’, is that it makes extraordinary what was once (and
in many ways always has been) ordinary. As such, it is an attempt to
strike an accommodation between characteristically ‘political’ behav-
iour, and the relatively new ethical paradigms that were traced above
in section 3.2. It is true, however, that this text only concerns (cid:2)pad-
dharma (rather than, say, n(cid:5)tir (cid:2)patsu) by the implications that accrue
to it through Yudhiùñhira’s opening pra(cid:3)na and its inclusion in a par-
van concerned with ‘(cid:2)paddharma’. Beyond this, the text does not ex-
plicitly argue this itself. Rather, it is resolutely political in its outlook,
as Bh(cid:8)ùma establishes in the outer frame and (cid:6)atruütapa in the opera-
tive frame. But the text is aware that the means to political success it
describes are full of difficulties. Kaõiïka makes this point abundantly
clear in one of his closing stanzas (138.69):
it(cid:5)dam uktaü v(cid:8)jin(cid:2)bhisaühitaü na caitad evaü puruùaþ sam(cid:2)caret|
paraprayuktaü tu kathaü ni(cid:3)(cid:2)mayed ato mayoktaü bhavato
hit(cid:2)rthin(cid:2)||
What has been discussed is replete with wickedness, and no man should
behave in this way. But how can a man learn what is suitable for ene-
mies? For this purpose I have said this to you, since I am concerned for
your welfare.
If these political means truly are ‘replete with wickedness’, then how
are they just? Yudhiùñhira’s apparently innocuous opening pra(cid:3)na
suggests an avenue to explore this question. This pra(cid:3)na, which
frames the entire text, provides both cosmic and social justification for
the royal behaviour this text extols. It juxtaposes the roles of fate and
human behaviour in the play of human destiny. The decay of dharma
is causally associated with the ‘end of a yuga’ (yugakùaya), time is
beyond humanity’s power to control; but then the oppression perpe-
trated by bandits, barbarians and other outsiders is a human failing,
most especially the king’s, since controlling them is his duty. In the
end, the ‘decay of dharma’ is due to both human failings and fate
(daiva, k(cid:2)la, yugakùaya). And while dharma decays due to cosmic
events, the decay of dharma also has cosmic consequences. The sur-
vival of the kingdom and the survival of dharma are linked in an ines-
capable circle of causation. It is, of course, especially the king’s duty
268 CHAPTER SIX
to rectify the situation. Through his puruùak(cid:2)ra, his manly activity,
his upholding of the daõóa, it is the king alone who can restore society
to its dharma, suppress dasyus, and rebuild the kingdom, the only re-
liably fertile ground for br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma. This is the paradox.
Though these deeds are ‘replete with wickedness’, though they are
necessarily political, calculating and violent, their final justification is
that they enable dharma.223
6.12 ‘The dialogue between Vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)mitra and the dog-cooker’
(Mbh 12.139; SU 12)
This and the following text are pivotal chapters in the (cid:2)DhP. These
two texts must be read together, since SU 13 is very much an interpre-
tation of the narrative contained in SU 12. It is somewhat unusual in
the (cid:2)DhP that a narrative is followed by a separate text containing a
substantial discussion of its themes. This particular unit concerns the
famous case of the sage Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra, who was driven by starvation to
consume dog meat. Manu (10.108) cites this case to demonstrate that
br(cid:3)hmans do not commit a sin (doùa) if they accept food from people
considered low in status—or, indeed, eat any kind of food—when they
are in distress (rules for such behaviour are usually strictly circum-
scribed).224
This chapter is thematically connected to SU 3. Indeed, Yudhi-
ùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na which opened that unit is repeated and expanded upon
here. Thus 130.1ab, 1cd, 2ab and 2cd are found in exactly the same or
very similar forms at 139.1ab, 6ab, 6cd and 7ab respectively. Fur-
thermore, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s behaviour is a demonstration of vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala,225
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
223 N(cid:8)lakaõñha’s opening statement to the next chapter indicates the difficulties that
a teaching such as Kaõiïka’s may have caused: (cid:2)pady ak(cid:2)ryam api kaõikenoktaü
tatra vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)mitra(cid:3)vaj(cid:2)ghan(cid:5)pacanar(cid:6)paü (cid:3)iùñ(cid:2)c(cid:2)raþ pram(cid:2)õayati| ‘This [chapter 138]
was related by Kaõika for a time of distress even though it shouldn’t be done, here
[chapter 139] the conduct of the learned is used as the authority for the circumstances
of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s cooking of the dog’s rump.’

dietary language,” JAOS, 122.2 (2002), pp.345-54.

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 269
‘the power of discriminating judgement’, a theme already explored in
that same prior unit.
Firstly, to orient the discussion, a summary of the tale:
Once, at the conjunction of the Tret(cid:2) and Dv(cid:2)para yugas, a drought
lasting for twelve years226 had decimated the environment and rendered
all people desperate and starving. Consequently, br(cid:3)hmans were at-
tacked, dharma was weak, people were eating each other and sages
((cid:8)ùis) abandoned their observances. The great sage Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra was
starving and, wandering around everywhere, came across a disgusting
(cid:3)vapaca (‘dog-cooker’) village. After unsuccessfully searching and
begging for food, the sage saw dog meat in a caõó(cid:2)la’s house and, in
desperation, resolved to steal it while the caõó(cid:2)la slept. In the process,
however, he woke the caõó(cid:2)la, who was shocked to discover a famous
sage stealing meat as impure as dog’s rump. The great sage and the
low-caste ‘dog-cooker’ engaged in a long debate on law (dharma) and
the justness of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s theft of the meat. Trying to convince
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra that his actions were wrong, the caõó(cid:2)la adopted the strict
position that such an act is never justified. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra argued that cir-
cumstances and the counsel of properly learned men (people like him-
self) determine an act’s justification. Anyway, even though performing
such an impure action, the sage could purify himself through austerities.
Despite the caõó(cid:2)la’s pleas, the sage stole the rump. Indra then rained,
breaking the drought. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra, as he had promised, performed great
austerities and purified himself, and eventually gained the greatest per-
fection.
Before discussing this saüv(cid:2)da in more detail, we need to look a little
closer at the opening elements of the frame which encompass it. As
already noted, Yudhiùñhira’s opening pra(cid:3)nas (139.1-8) elaborate the
pra(cid:3)na found at 130.1-2, and more richly characterise a time of (cid:2)pad
in terms of the weakness of dharma, the depravity of human behav-
iour and environmental and social degradation. All three dimensions
are, of course, intimately related. Yudhiùñhira poses four questions.
The first two (139.6-7), which immediately follow his description of
(cid:2)pad, concern br(cid:3)hmans, and ask how they can live at this ‘lowest
time’ (jaghanye k(cid:2)le). The second two (139.8) concern the king, ask-
ing what he should do when ‘people have become foul’ (loke kaluùa-
t(cid:2)ü gate), and how he should not be driven from dharma and artha.
Therefore, an important problem being broached here is how a king
should treat br(cid:3)hmans who transgress their normal rules of behaviour
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
226 This poetic figure is typically associated with droughts and rains; see Spellman,
“The symbolic significance.”
270 CHAPTER SIX
in times of distress, and, furthermore, how he should act to ensure a
prosperous kingdom. It is important to keep in mind this twofold ori-
entation towards the br(cid:3)hman and the king in understanding both SUs
12 and 13.
The opening description in Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)nas sets up a signifi-
cant principle for this discussion. The br(cid:3)hman is innocent. He adopts
certain behaviours through the force of circumstances, rather than
through his desire to behave in ‘undesirable’ ways. This is particularly
highlighted through the theme of the decay of time, which occurs in
both 139.6d (‘when the lowest time has arrived’, jaghanye k(cid:2)la (cid:2)gate)
and in the tale itself (Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s desperate act occurs at the conjunc-
tion of two yugas).227 As we have already seen in both SU 3 and the
previous unit, cosmic decay is a typical motif of a situation of (cid:2)pad. 228
Yet, if the br(cid:3)hman is absolved of any responsibility for the cir-
cumstances that lead to his perverse behaviour, an absolution that goes
some way towards sanctioning the behaviour he adopts, the king’s
responsibilties are entirely different. Bh(cid:8)ùma immediately establishes
this in his reply to Yudhiùñhira (139.9-10):
r(cid:2)jam(cid:6)l(cid:2) mah(cid:2)r(cid:2)ja yogakùemasuv(cid:8)ùñayaþ|
praj(cid:2)su vy(cid:2)dhaya(cid:3) caiva maraõaü ca bhay(cid:2)ni ca||
k(cid:8)taü tret(cid:2) dv(cid:2)para(cid:3) ca kali(cid:3) ca bharatarùabha|
r(cid:2)jam(cid:6)l(cid:2)ni sarv(cid:2)õi mama n(cid:2)sty atra saü(cid:3)ayaþ||
Great king, good rains and the security of property among the people
have their foundation in the king; as also fear, death and disease. The
K(cid:8)ta, Tret(cid:2), Dv(cid:2)para and Kali [ages], bull of Bharatas, all these are
founded on the king. On this I have no doubt.229
In distinction from the br(cid:3)hman, who can only be a victim of his cir-
cumstances, through exertion proper to his station the king must estab-
lish a secure environment for his people to pursue their proper liveli-
hoods and for dharma to flourish.230
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

course of fate’ (daivavidhikram(cid:2)t).

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 271
After these preliminaries establishing the fundamental importance
of the king’s role in securing the well-being of his kingdom and sub-
jects, even from decline on a cosmic scale, Bh(cid:8)ùma introduces an an-
swer to some of Yudhiùñhira’s question (139.11):
tasmiüs tv abhy(cid:2)gate k(cid:2)le praj(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü doùak(cid:2)rake|
vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabalam (cid:2)sth(cid:2)ya j(cid:5)vitavyaü tad(cid:2) bhavet||
But when the time has arrived that brings about wrong-doing among the
subjects, one should remain alive through recourse to the power of dis-
criminating judgement.
As we saw in the discussion of SU 3 ((cid:2)DhP 130), vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala refers
to the ability of properly learned br(cid:3)hmans (that is, learned in dharma,
and, implicitly, in the Veda) to discern the proper application of
dharma when circumstances are limiting or, otherwise said, the bal-
ancing of scripture and exigency. In that earlier chapter, the subject of
the verb in Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response in 130.3ab (which is much the same as
139.11) is the br(cid:3)hman. However, in 139.11 this is not quite as clear.
Is the subject a br(cid:3)hman? Or the king (as it might logically follow
from 139.9-10)? Or both? That is to say, is the king to apply vij(cid:9)(cid:2)na-
bala as well? And, if so, what are the implications of this? An instance
of ambiguity in the treatment of similar themes was already suggested
in regard to the closing stanzas of SU 3,231 and once again we shall
note the problem while deferring further treatment until the discussion
of the next unit. What is clear is that the saüv(cid:2)da of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra and
the (cid:3)vapaca is meant as a demonstration of vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala, and conse-
quently instructs the king on the intrinsic and privileged relationship
between br(cid:3)hman sages and dharma.
This dialogue has already been treated in some detail in two articles
by David White,232 in which he discusses the tale as one myth of a
‘Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra cycle’. White focuses on two aspects in particular. First,
the role this cycle and especially the above tale play in the ideological
exclusion of the outcaste (represented here by the ‘dog-cooker’
caõó(cid:2)la) from br(cid:3)hmaõic conceptions of society.233 And second, Vi(cid:5)-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

233 Does the retelling of a myth bring into play the whole cycle of myths to which
it belongs (cf. White, “You Are What You Eat,” p.75)? When Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra identifies
(cid:3)
272 CHAPTER SIX
v(cid:3)mitra’s embodiment of the “radical separation”234 between the
r(cid:2)jarùi, the ‘royal sage’, and the brahmarùi, the br(cid:3)hman sage, which
finds its classic expression in the conflict between Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra and Va-
siùñha in numerous myths of the cycle. Clearly Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s dealings
with an outcaste like a (cid:3)vapaca thematically concur with a theme that
constantly recurs in the (cid:2)DhP. As we have repeatedly seen, one po-
tential consequence of a time of (cid:2)pad is that the earth will be overrun
by brigands or barbarians who do not directly participate in (or rather,
are exluded from) br(cid:3)hmaõic socio-cultural institutions.235 It is por-
trayed as an unending danger that dharma—proper conduct as it ap-
plies to each individual in accordance with his social standing—the
ideological centre of the br(cid:3)hmaõic world view, will be subsumed, or
rather consumed, by those who exist apart from and in complete dis-
cord with this ideology. Paradigmatically, the br(cid:3)hman is in danger of
becoming other than a br(cid:3)hman (a theme Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra gives direct ex-
pression to in 139.76).
The second theme discussed by White, the tension between the
r(cid:2)jarùi and brahmarùi, is less obviously prevalent here. It is notable
that neither of these terms plays any part in the (cid:2)DhP myth. When
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra is referred to as ‘sage’, it is as either maharùi or simply (cid:8)ùi.
Furthermore, the term r(cid:2)jarùi is mostly used without controversy in
the (cid:6)P, applying usually to a wise and ruling king, and not to a “non-
ruling, renunciant, r(cid:2)jarùi”.236 On the other hand, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s prior
status as a kùatriya who performed austerities to become a br(cid:3)hman,237
from whence White draws this theme, may have been a factor in the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
himself to the caõó(cid:2)la, the caõó(cid:2)la immediately knows who he is (139.44-5). Does
this mirror the experience of the audience?

236 Myths of the Dog-man, p.80. Note, for example, that in attempting to convince
Yudhiùñhira not to renounce the kingdom by arguing for the dharmic nature of politi-
cal behaviour, in (cid:6)P 8.31 Arjuna insists that the ‘royal sages (r(cid:2)jarùaya) who have
won heaven call this their dharma’. See above p.142 n.27. In (cid:2)DhP 130, which sets
out ideas developed in the Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra tale, r(cid:2)jarùi refers to the king not a br(cid:3)hman.

man, see Mbh 13.3-4. In another myth of the ‘Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra cycle’ (the story of (cid:6)unaþ-
(cid:5)epa) Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra is figured as the father (through a curse he lays on fifty of his sons)
of numerous dasyus (Myths of the Dog-Man, pp.80-2’ “You Are What You Eat,”
pp.65-7), described in Mbh 13.3.8 as (cid:3)vapacas.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 273
inclusion of this myth here, especially if Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s behaviour can
be considered a model for the king.238 White’s question “Can a king
become a technician of the sacred?”239 is most pertinent in this regard.
But rather than focusing on the supposedly ‘renunciant’ r(cid:2)jarùi, we
should pose the question in terms of the ruling king, his application of
political policy and the relationship that this application has to
dharma, the customs and laws of the br(cid:3)hmaõic social order. This
question will become especially important for the next unit under dis-
cussion.
SU 12 is primarily concerned with the proper epistemological and
hermeneutic foundations of dharma, what the dharma-s(cid:6)tras and
-(cid:3)(cid:2)stras refer to as the dharmam(cid:6)las, the ‘sources of dharma’. The
frequently technical argument is given in the form of a debate between
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra and the lowly (cid:3)vapaca.240 For the most part this debate
takes place between stanzas 139.64-87. Prior to this, stanzas 139.13-
25 provide a thick literary description of a time of (cid:2)pad, highlighting
the usual themes of environmental degradation, cosmic decay, human
depravity, the course of divine fate (daiva), the passing of the yugas,
the decay of dharma and the overwhelming of the earth by barbari-
ans.241 Stanzas 139.27-30 describe the (cid:3)vapacas’ village in terms de-
signed to underline their lowly status and impure way of life, with
special attention being paid to their practice of killing all manner of
animals.242 The next sequence of stanzas, 139.31-41, portrays Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra’s desperation and, in 139.36-9, his reasons for stealing the meat.
Here we have the first salvo in the argument the story serves, though
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s interlocutor has yet to appear. In the first case he justifies
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
238 Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra does not, it seems, completely cast off his prior identity. In the ac-
count of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s brahminisation in Bailey (The Mythology, p.216), to “consoli-
date his newly won status Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra asks … that he become the best of the knowers
of the kùatra and brahma knowledge”.

240 On (cid:3)vapaca, and the other terms for ‘outcaste’ used here, caõó(cid:2)la and m(cid:2)taïga,
see White, Myths of the Dog-man, pp.71-113, esp. pp.71f. Incidentally, the term for
the (cid:3)vapaca’s village, pakkaõa (139.12, 33, 41, 43), a non Indo-Aryan word, suggests
and emphasis on the cultural differentiation of the outcaste. On this word, see M.
Emeneau, “The Indian linguistic area revisited,” in Language and linguistic area:
essays by Murray B. Emeneau, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1980, p.225.
241 This latter point is made somewhat elliptically in 139.23, ‘the earth was mostly
filled with men who had become dark’ ((cid:3)y(cid:2)vabh(cid:6)tanarapr(cid:2)y(cid:2) babh(cid:6)va vasudh(cid:2) …).
242 In 139.27 they are described as hiüsr(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü pr(cid:2)õihant®õ(cid:2)m ‘cruel murderers of
living beings’, and each subsequent verse in this series refers to the remains of dead
animals in their village.
274 CHAPTER SIX
himself because there ‘is no other way to support my life’,243 and then,
in 139.39, offers a second reason, that there is no fault (doùa) since he
only steals from ‘lowly people’ (ant(cid:2)vas(cid:2)na). Once he has woken the
caõó(cid:2)la while trying to steal the meat, he justifies himself again, this
time in answer to the (cid:3)vapaca’s confused questioning. This marks the
proper beginning of the debate.
Stanzas 139.47-63 set the basic parameters of the saüv(cid:2)da, with
both participants making substantial statements before the dialogue
shifts to the more typical pattern of alternatng brief statements. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra’s first form of defence is much the same as his initial explana-
tion. He must steal the dog’s rump ((cid:3)vaj(cid:2)ghan(cid:5)) because he has ex-
hausted all other options and otherwise will die (139.47-9, 58). In this
section, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra also asserts his relationship to dharma: he under-
takes to steal the meat ‘even though he knows his own law’ (svadhar-
maü budhyam(cid:2)no ’pi),244 and compares himself to Agni, ‘just as he-
who-consumes-everything (Agni) is a br(cid:3)hman, so understand me
from the perspective of dharma’.245 Significantly, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra argues
for the importance of always striving to stay alive (139.59, 61-3),
since it is only then that one can obtain dharma;246 anything ‘inauspi-
cious’ (a(cid:3)ubha) can then be pushed away through austerities (139.63).
The caõó(cid:2)la is concerned about dharma as well, but for him it is
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s deviation from dharma (139.52). Dogs, he argues, are
the lowest animals (m(cid:8)g(cid:2)n(cid:2)m adhamaü), and the ‘thigh and rump’
((cid:6)ruj(cid:2)ghan(cid:5)) their lowest part (139.53). Finally, he says (139.55-6):
s(cid:2)dhv anyam anupa(cid:3)ya tvam up(cid:2)yaü pr(cid:2)õadh(cid:2)raõe|

Good man, you must discover another means for the preservation of
your life, great sage, so that there shall be no loss of your ascetic heat
because of this desire for meat. This path is forbidden, as you know;
this mixing of laws (dharmas) should not take place! Do not abandon
the law (dharma), for you are the finest knower of law (dharma)!

life, a theme we encountered earlier. See above pp.215f. and n.82.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 275
And so the debate begins with the low-caste (cid:3)vapaca paradoxically
lecturing the great sage Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra on his proper dharma, and Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra in turn suggesting the merit of eating dog meat. While the open-
ing verses to this unit stress the br(cid:3)hman’s victimisation by circum-
stances beyond his control, the (cid:3)vapaca points towards Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s
agency in his own situation: he steals meat out of ‘greed’ (lobha), a
charge to which the (cid:3)vapaca shall return.247 This reflects a major ten-
sion in (cid:2)paddharma, since (cid:2)paddharma comes into its own some-
where on the hazy line between desire and necessity. The (cid:3)vapaca’s
alleged confusion of the two goes someway towards establishing that,
even if he has got the basic principle right, he is incapable from the
perspective of br(cid:3)hmaõic orthodoxy of appreciating the subtle applica-
tion of dharma.
After these opening salvos, the dialogue assumes a fairly regular
structure, with the two participants alternating (mostly) single stanza
statements. It is from here that the scholastic character of the argument
is most apparent, with both debaters employing well acknowledged
standards of authority and sometimes quite technical definitions. For
example, in response to the caõó(cid:2)la’s plea in 139.64 to not eat the dog
‘for dog is not eaten by the twice-born’ (hy abhakùo dvij(cid:2)n(cid:2)m), Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra reiterates the hopelessness of his situation and adds that ‘the six
flavours are definitely in this dog meat’ ((cid:3)vam(cid:2)üse c(cid:2)smin ùaóras(cid:2)n),
presumably to reinforce the idea of its suitability as food.248 This
somewhat unconvincing justification is immediately countered by the
(cid:3)vapaca with a technical definition derived from the traditions of
dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra (139.66):
pa(cid:9)ca pa(cid:9)canakh(cid:2) bhakùy(cid:2) brahmakùatrasya vai dvija|
yadi (cid:3)(cid:2)straü pram(cid:2)õaü te m(cid:2)bhakùye m(cid:2)nasaü k(cid:8)th(cid:2)þ||
There are only five five-nailed [animals] which can be eaten by br(cid:3)h-
mans and kùatriyas, twice-born; if the (cid:3)(cid:2)stra is your standard, you must
not hold this opinion in regard to forbidden food.
This is a normative definition of edible animals which only permits
the eating of hares, porcupines, hedgehogs, monitor lizards and tor-
toises among the ‘five-nailed’ (sometimes, in an anomaly discussed in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

276 CHAPTER SIX
an interesting article by S. Jamison,249 the three-toed rhino is added as
well). This definition, drawn from the technical dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stra tradi-
tion,250 incongruously comes from the mouth of an outcaste. Under-
scoring the strictly normative context of his argument, the (cid:3)vapaca
evokes (cid:3)(cid:2)stra—precisely the tradition Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra ought to be an ex-
pert in—as the pram(cid:2)õa, another technical term denoting the ‘means
of true knowledge, the ‘standard’ or ‘authority’ on matters to do with
dharma. Does Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra dare to act apart from (cid:5)(cid:3)stric prescription?
Yes! is Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s resounding reply. But that is not to say he acts
without proper sanction or authority, at least in his own eyes, and it is
‘his own eyes’ alone that truly matter. The sage evokes a precedent:
since a crisis has overcome him ((cid:2)padgata), he will eat the dog’s
haunch just as ‘starving Agastya devoured the asura V(cid:3)t(cid:3)pi’.251 As he
explains in 139.69, he will imitate this conduct, since the ‘learned
alone are the source in regard to right conduct’ ((cid:3)iùñ(cid:2) vai k(cid:2)raõaü
dharme). As should be clear by now, we are firmly within the sphere
of the dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stric definitions of the dharmam(cid:6)las, the sources of
dharma.252 The (cid:3)vapaca, however, will have none of it, and accuses
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra of arguing ‘deceptively’ (chalena),253 quite rightly chal-
lenging the basis for Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s citation of the tale: ‘what the person
who was solicited made for that br(cid:3)hman was the sanction for it being
eaten by the sage’.254 While this brief statement is somewhat elliptical,
it is clearly a reference to the Agastya-V(cid:3)t(cid:3)pi story. In this tale, nar-
rated at Mbh 3.94-7, V(cid:3)t(cid:3)pi’s brother Ilvala kills br(cid:3)hmans by turning
V(cid:3)t(cid:3)pi into meat (this is what yad … k(cid:8)tam in 139.72 refers to), and
offering the meat to the br(cid:3)hmans. Ilvala then summons his brother
back to life, exploding any br(cid:3)hman who has eaten him. With some
other kings, Agastya approaches Ilvala for riches (implied by
arthitena in 139.72, glossed by N(cid:8)lakaõñha as pr(cid:2)rthitena), which he
needs in order that his new wife will have sex with him. Ilvala offers

Dharma System,” JAOS, 118.2 (1998), pp.249-56; see also Zimmermann, The Jungle,
pp.173-4.
250 According to Olivelle (“Abhakùya and abhojya,” p.346) abhakùya “refers to
items of food, both animals and vegetables, that are completely forbidden; they cannot
be eaten except under the most dire circumstances”.

his brother as meat which, as guests, they are obliged to eat. The sage
eats the meat in order to save the kings’ lives. Agastya then farts
V(cid:3)t(cid:3)pi out before Ilvala can summon him forth! The important point
the (cid:3)vapaca alludes to is that the motives behind the two acts are quite
different. Agastya did not eat the meat because he was starving, as
suggested by Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra (139.67), but out of his obligations as a guest
and his desire to save the kings’ lives.255 Agastya’s behaviour, there-
fore, is clearly not the precedent Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra thinks it is.256
Perhaps it is because of this that the sage drops this line of reason-
ing, and introduces a different standard by which his behaviour can be
measured. Firstly, in 139.73 and 75 he iterates the importance of the
body ((cid:2)tm(cid:2)) as the prerequisite for being able to do any kind of good
deed257 (a point consistent with his initial statements in 139.59 and 61-
3). And then in 139.76:
buddhy(cid:2)tmake vyastam ast(cid:5)ti tuùño
moh(cid:2)d ekatvaü yath(cid:2) carma cakùuþ|
yady apy enaþ saü(cid:3)ay(cid:2)d (cid:2)car(cid:2)mi

I am satisfied that it [the body—m(cid:6)la in 75d]258 is separated from what
relates to the intellect. Due to confusion they are considered one, like
skin and the eye. Even if I make this error out of doubt, I will not be
like you are!
This is a crucial stanza that has two key points. The first is Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra’s use of the participle tuùña. ‘I am satisfied’ he says, as if this is
enough to carry the argument. But that is precisely the point, it is
enough. Indeed, Manu himself attests that ‘self satisfaction’ ((cid:2)tma-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
255 See Jamison, Sacrificed Wife, pp.199-201 on the ramifications of not accepting
guest offerings. Jamison discusses this story on p.202, and notes their obligation as
guests to eat the offered food. This story is referred to in KA 1.6.10 and versions are
told at R(cid:3)m 3.10.53-65 and 3.41.39-44.
256 Of course, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra might argue that he was citing it merely as an indication
of what can be legitimately done in a crisis. Cf. Glucklich, The Sense of Adharma,
p.49, for an instance in which the R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa also inappropriately cites this tale as a
precedent.
257 N(cid:8)lakaõñha glosses (cid:2)tm(cid:2) with deha. See also Fitzgerald’s n.3 to 139.75 (The
Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.767). On excellent grounds Fitzgerald amends Belvalkar’s
reading of pada 75c from ahaü punar varta ity (cid:2)(cid:3)ay(cid:2)tm(cid:2) to ahaü punar vratan-
ity(cid:2)(cid:3)ay(cid:2)tm(cid:2), ‘yet, I have a body which is always the seat of the devout observances’.
258 I follow Fitzgerald in taking the implied subject of asti to be m(cid:6)la from
139.75d. Fitzgerald has many important insights for the understanding of this difficult
sequence of stanzas. For a different view, see Belvalkar’s notes to 139.75-6 in the CE.
278 CHAPTER SIX
tuùñi) is a suitable source of dharma.259 Implicitly this means a person
learned in the Veda, that is, a sage or (cid:3)iùña just like Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra. The
second point speaks directly to the problem of the mixing of dharmas
(remembering that the caõó(cid:2)la warns Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra of this in 139.56):
though acting like a ‘dog-cooker’ Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra contends that he will not
become a ‘dog-cooker’. He will not fall from his social class and be-
come an outcaste himself. At this time, of course, (cid:2)paddharma ap-
plies, and it is precisely to avoid such a situation as varõasaükara (or
dharmasaükara) that (cid:2)paddharma is promulgated in the dharma-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras.
The caõó(cid:2)la does not concede, and he reiterates his opinion, noting
that by reproaching the br(cid:3)hman he is effecting an odd reversal of
roles. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s reply underscores the hermeneutic and epistemo-
logical point being made in this story, as well as, of course, the out-
caste’s exclusion from the br(cid:3)hmaõic ideology of dharma (78):
pibanty evodakaü g(cid:2)vo maõó(cid:6)keùu ruvatsv api|
na te ’dhik(cid:2)ro dharme ’sti m(cid:2) bh(cid:6)r (cid:2)tmapra(cid:3)aüsakaþ||
Cows drink water even while frogs chirp. You have no authority in re-
gard to dharma. You must not praise yourself.
If the dog-cooker earlier instructed Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra on how to properly
understand the sanction for Agastya eating V(cid:3)t(cid:3)pi, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra now
turns this against him. The outcaste has no ‘adhik(cid:2)ra’. This term, used
frequently in M(cid:5)m(cid:2)üs(cid:2) and the dharma literature, typically refers to
an individual’s ‘right’ to perform some rite or act of dharma, though
Lariviere argues persuasively that it should be understood in the sense
of ‘responsibility’ as well.260 A parallel to 139.78c is found in MS
10.126c, where it indicates that (cid:5)(cid:4)dras have ‘no authority in regard to
dharma’, though it adds they are not totally exluded (pratiùedhana)
from it either. For Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra, 139.78 is a response to the (cid:3)vapaca’s
fantasising in the previous stanza (139.77) that he has committed a
patan(cid:5)ya, a crime involving the loss of one’s station in life, in provid-
ing dog meat to Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra considers this patently ridicu-
lous, since a patan(cid:5)ya can only be committed if one has the right

(adhik(cid:2)ra) to perform dharma in the first place.261 The dog-cooker,
being excluded from br(cid:3)hmaõic conceptions of dharma, cannot com-
mit a sin within the terms of that system. The simile in padas a and b
emphasises the (cid:3)vapaca’s profound insignificance: the cow simply
ignores the frog despite his incessant chirping.262 In this sense, while
White is correct to say that the (cid:3)vapaca is “unable to comprehend a
special law of relativity for those particular situations in which the
general law must be superseded by extraordinary behaviour”, it is not
necessarily because he is “living in a perpetual catastrophic state of
(cid:2)paddharma”, but rather because, according to this particular strain of
br(cid:3)hmaõic thinking, his very nature makes it impossible.263
The debate continues, but the central point has been made. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra reiterates that living he will be able to perform dharma properly
(139.82), and adds the important scholastic argument that eating the
dog meat constitutes an exception (apav(cid:2)da) to the rules. The caõó(cid:2)la
refuses to concede, restating his principled stand (139.85): ‘your au-
thoritative source is neither the Veda nor any other dharma’ (na te
vedaþ k(cid:2)raõaü n(cid:2)nyadharmaþ), and only ‘good conduct drives the
wise man away from the wrong place, from faults and from being re-
viled’.264 Yet, we know how the story ends. Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s understand-
ing of dharma receives the ultimate sanction, as Indra breaks the
drought. Through his rigid appeal to the scriptural codes, the outcaste
demonstrates his complete misunderstanding of the nature of dharma,
a misunderstanding that confirms his exclusion from br(cid:3)hmaõic con-
ceptions of dharma. While Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra, through his acute appreciation
of the circumstances afflicting him in relation to dharma, demon-
strates the br(cid:3)hman’s (self-styled) privilege in properly understanding
and applying dharma. In his closing statement, Bh(cid:8)ùma reminds us
why he recited the story in the first place, as a demonstration of the
role of the intellect in adjudicating on issues of dharma, reaffirming a
principle he has already enunciated (139.93):265

What has been taught is terrible, like a lie that can’t be believed. Is it
the bandit’s law that I should spurn? I’m confused and dejected. My
law (dharma) has become so lax! I keep ruminating for some reason,
but I can put the effort in no more!
With these words in 140.1-2, Yudhiùñhira, despairing at the story nar-
rated in SU 12, despondently opens SU 13. Yudhiùñhira’s strongly ex-
pressed anguish recalls his immediate post-war despair in the opening
chapters of the (cid:6)P.266 The use of the word udyama—which we have
already seen is associated (along with its cognates and synonyms)
with proper royal behaviour267—especially reminds us of his distaste
for, and equivocation in, performing his royal duties. We will see
shortly that on a number of other occasions in this unit Bh(cid:8)ùma di-
rectly underscores such character attributes that Yudhiùñhira displays
throughout the Mbh. This echoing of Yudhiùñhira’s principal narrative
characterisation plays the important role of reminding the reader of the
context in which he finds these texts; and in doing so it assists in ‘ty-
ing’ these didactic texts to the broader Mbh context.
This SU is directly concerned with an interpretation of the ‘lesson’
dramatised in the Vi(cid:3)v(cid:2)mitra(cid:3)vapacasaüv(cid:2)da in SU 12. How is
Yudhiùñhira meant to take this story that portrays a supposedly lax
attitude to dharmic prescription? Is he meant to use Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s atti-
tude to dharma as an analogy for the difficult problems of ruling?
And, if so, in what way? Or is he meant merely to acknowledge the
special status of br(cid:3)hmans that they apparently deserve due to their
uniquely privileged relationship to dharma? How are we meant to take

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 281
the question, asti svid dasyumary(cid:2)d(cid:2) y(cid:2)m ahaü parivarjaye? What is
the dasyumary(cid:2)d(cid:2)—the bandit’s law, limit or boundary—to which he
refers? Is it specifically referring to the (cid:3)vapaca’s strict appeal to
(cid:5)(cid:3)stric norms, and hence expressive of Yudhiùñhira’s apparent disgust
at having to distance himself from such a rigorous morality? Is it Vi(cid:5)-
v(cid:3)mitra’s decision to eat the dog and hence his apparent distancing
from (cid:5)(cid:3)stric prescription (a likening of the sage’s behaviour to that of
a ‘bandit’ (cid:3)vapaca)? Or is it the pragmatic attitude of compliance to-
wards the br(cid:3)hman the king must adopt in the face of such behaviour
and, by analogy, the attitude he must adopt towards his entire rule? 268
The question is ambiguous, and we are likely to find no clear answer.
Indeed, the subsequent discussion canvasses a number of these issues,
so we must perhaps resign ourselves to the ambiguity, at least for the
moment. The intelligent understanding and application of dharma
sanctions precisely the kinds of political behaviour that provokes
Yudhiùñhira’s distemper, both in his attitude to his citizens’ behaviour,
and in the behaviour he must adopt to secure the kingdom’s prosper-
ity. At the same time the privileged position of br(cid:3)hmans is always af-
firmed, and indeed is considered an important gauge of the standard of
a king’s rule. And both of these demand that the king becomes, in
some sense, ‘a technician of the sacred’, to know when and how to
act, and to know his limits.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
268 Fitzgerald offers the translation, ‘This is barbarian law, which I shun.’ This
does not translate the particle svid as an interrogative (as he does in the rhetorically
similar question in 140.34), and takes the verb parivarjaye as a causative present in-
dicative (cid:2)tmanepada, as, at first glance, it certainly appears to be. In his A Grammar
of Epic Sanskrit (Berlin; New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2003, pp.175-6), however,
Oberlies refers to a first person singular optative -e that “seems to be originally due to
the haplological shortening of °(a)ye<ya(m)>”, citing as one of his examples the cur-
rent phrase. Oberlies (p.175 n.5) is aware, of course, that there is no way to disam-
biguate this form from the 1st person sg. present indicatve (cid:2)tmanepada form, and
cites for substantiation only those instances in which there is a varia lectio having a
“‘regular’ optative”. All of the manuscripts of the Mbh’s southern recension (and D7,
a devan(cid:2)gar(cid:5) mss. located in Tanjore) used for the CE of the (cid:2)DhP have the variant
ayaü parivarjayet, shifting the subject of the verb to either Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra or the (cid:3)vapaca
from (cid:2)DhP 139. Additional support for the position that parivarjaye is an optative
comes from (cid:2)DhP 140.26 and 140.34, both of which have verbs in the optative mood
and which clearly rhetorically echo 140.1. The former (employing parivarjayet, as in
the southern versions of 140.1) responds to the initial question in 140.1 (see below
p.289 and n.302), the latter (employing atilaïghayet) partially restates that question
(p.290 and n.304). The use of the particle svid as a stand alone interrogative without
ka or its derivatives, or other than as a disjunctive particle in a series of interrogatives,
appears to be quite rare.
282 CHAPTER SIX
This unit, then, is primarily about the relationship between dharma,
the intellect, the proper constituents and role of authoritative tradition
((cid:3)(cid:2)stra), and political conduct. It can be roughly divided into four sec-
tions:
A. 3-11, the function of the intellect (buddhi) and wisdom (praj(cid:9)(cid:2)) in
understanding dharma;
B. 12-22, a polemic on the proper role of authoritative tradition
((cid:3)(cid:2)stras);
C. 23-33, r(cid:2)jan(cid:5)ti;
D. 35-8, how to behave towards br(cid:3)hmans.
A. BUDDHI, PRAJÑ(cid:4), DHARMA.
The first section argues that dharma cannot be properly understood or
applied without due intellectual consideration. This proposition does
not undermine dharma, but places it in the context of a proper herme-
neutic based on sound learning and reasoning. Bh(cid:8)ùma’s opening reply
to Yudhiùñhira clearly establishes the flexible approach to the ‘authori-
tative tradition’ and the pragmatically based application of dharma
being inculcated here: ‘your instruction in the law (dharma) is not
from the pure sacred tradition alone’.269 Rather ‘a king should use all
kinds of wisdom’,270 since ‘when kings follow law (dharma) that
arises from the intellect they are victorious’.271 Clearly we are in the
same territory as represented by an idea like vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala, the putative
topic of the previous unit.272 It is essential that the king approaches
dharma in a hermeneutically sophisticated manner, since neither does
a ‘means of living arise’ nor is ‘the dharma of kings established
through the dharma of one school alone’.273 It is here that we come
closest to a very clear statement on the king’s proper attitude to
dharma. On a number of occasions in earlier units we posed the ques-
tion of how a concept like vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala relates to the executive respon-
sibilties of the king.274 Is he meant to apply this principle as well, this

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 283
intelligent and reasoned inquiry into the relationship of dharma to
worldly contingencies? Is he meant to be, in White’s words, a ‘techni-
cian of the sacred’? The answer here would seem to be yes. The rul-
ing, non-renunciant king should employ an intellectually rigorous ap-
proach when ascertaining the proper application of dharma to any
given situation. But we shall also see that Bh(cid:8)ùma introduces condi-
tions which ensure that there are limits to the application of the king’s
right to adjudicate on such matters. And these conditions ensure that
the authoritative position of the br(cid:3)hman is never dispensed with.
This doctrinally flexible attitude in the determination of dharma
prompts Bh(cid:8)ùma to pose a rhetorical question which reminds us of this
teaching’s context: ‘why has this wisdom for the weak not been dis-
cussed before?’275 The ‘weak’ man, durbala, refers not merely to Vi(cid:5)-
v(cid:3)mitra, but also draws us within the ambit of the ‘weak’ king, who,
as we have already seen, is a significant conditioning factor for times
of crisis.276 Bh(cid:8)ùma’s confessed reticence on this matter is apparently
due to the added complexity it brings to decision making. A person
with expectations of certainty shall find uncertainty confusing when
the ‘the path is divided in two’ (pathi dvaidhe); therefore, ‘from the
very outset it should be recognised that there are two ways of under-
standing things’.277 Sometimes there are difficult decisions to make
which induce moral conflict, a problem N(cid:8)lakaõñha illustrates with the
example: ‘even given the dharmic nature of causing no hurt there is
evil due to the protecting of a thief’.278 No one doubts that not hurting
someone is in itself good, but then nor does anyone doubt that thiev-
ing is bad.279 The question is, which does one prioritise? Not only,
therefore, is dharma complex in its putative sources, but so too is un-
derstanding how dharma applies in practice.
Both the interdependence of the intellect and dharma, and the dou-
bly difficult nature of their application to real problems is underlined
in 140.9:

279 Fitzgerald offers the gloss that dharma is twofold because it depends on capa-
bility, as in presumably Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s inability to perform proper br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma
because of his starvation.

Wisdom is the instrument that stands at one’s side, but it goes every-
where like a river;280 but a man has to properly understand the law
(dharma) as it is articulated first one way, and then another.
Given this complexity, it is appropriate for Bh(cid:8)ùma to add an ambigu-
ous note that may yet alleviate some of Yudhiùñhira’s anguish at the
disturbing story that has shaken his resolve. There are those who ‘un-
derstand correctly’ (samyag vij(cid:9)(cid:2)ninaþ), and there are others who
‘understand incorrectly’ (mithy(cid:2)vij(cid:9)(cid:2)ninaþ). But, as some consolation,
in understanding this ‘he grasps the knowledge of the good’ (j(cid:9)(cid:2)nam
(cid:2)dadate sat(cid:2)m), that is, the knowledge of precisely those sages (such
as Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra) Yudhiùñhira so admires, and whose monopoly over the
premier ideological concept of the br(cid:3)hmaõic world view has ob-
scured its ambiguous and complex character.
B. (cid:7)(cid:4)STRA
Having established the complexity of the nature of dharmic hermeneu-
tics, Bh(cid:8)ùma critiques the place of the ‘authoritative tradition’, the
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, in the ascertainment of dharma. He does not necessarily ob-
ject to the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras per se, but rather to those people who selectively
insist on a strict adherence to particular (cid:3)(cid:2)stras without a proper ap-
preciation of the complexities and contingencies of every day life, and
whatever ‘authoritative traditions’ ((cid:2)gama, (cid:3)(cid:2)stra) may be more ap-
propriately applied to such problems as are then raised.
In a series of articles Sheldon Pollock has explored the idea of
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra as it is used in Sanskrit discourse.281 He has especially stressed
that the word is defined as or implies the ‘regulation’ and ‘codifica-
tion’ of rules. In its strictest application (in some instances in both the
P(cid:6)rva- and Uttara-m(cid:5)m(cid:2)üs(cid:2) traditions), it is taken to specifically refer
to the Veda; while other usages have extended its application to en-
compass an ever increasing range of knowledge traditions.282 The im-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
280 I am especially indebted to Fitzgerald’s translation of these two padas.
281 S. Pollock, “The theory of practice and the practice of theory in Indian intellec-
tual history,” JAOS, 105.3 (1985), pp.499-519; “The Idea of (cid:6)(cid:3)stra in Traditional
India,” in A. L. Dallapiccola (ed.), The Shastric Traditions in the Indian Arts, Stutt-
gart: Steiner, 1989, pp.17-26; and in the same volume “Playing by the rules: (cid:6)(cid:3)stra
and Sanskrit Literature,” pp.301-12.
282 “The theory of practice,” pp.501f.; “The Idea of (cid:6)(cid:3)stra,” p.21ff.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 285
plication in all cases, however, is that the rules a (cid:3)(cid:2)stra codifies be-
come normative; they delimit the proper and authoritative forms that
behaviour should take. This “tradition of rule governance”283 derives
its ultimate authority from its connection to the Veda. And like the
Veda, (cid:3)(cid:2)stra is invested with permanence, immutability, transcen-
dence and “paramount authority”.284 Hence, even if in historical terms
many (cid:5)(cid:3)stric genres had their origins in description, over time they
fulfilled the function of prescriptive codes, and their contents became
binding and testimony to orthodoxy. The result of this progression is
that, in Pollock’s terms, “theory” ((cid:3)(cid:2)stra) came to proceed “practice”
(prayoga); the authoritative traditions contained in the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras asserted
“the authority to shape reality to themselves”,285 so that for any activ-
ity to be acceptable it must have as precedent “some pre-existent,
codified and theoretical paradigm”.286
How does Bh(cid:8)ùma’s discussion of the proper understanding of the
role of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra relate to this conception? Clearly a strict adherence to
(cid:5)(cid:3)stric prescription was seen to create problems for the contingencies
and political realities a king must encounter when administering his
territory. Indeed, it creates a problem for any kind of ‘worldly’ contin-
gency at all, as the development of the notion of (cid:2)paddharma attests
too and Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra’s story dramatises. Yet, the very development of
the concept of (cid:2)paddharma makes ‘(cid:5)(cid:3)stric’, and hence bestows some
legitimacy upon, behaviour that would otherwise be abhorrent. Rather
than take the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras themselves to task, a strategy fraught with danger
given their authoritative status and which, in any case, is not really the
point, Bh(cid:8)ùma attacks those people who rigorously insist on adhering
to particular and selective examples of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra (140.11):
parimuùõanti (cid:3)(cid:2)str(cid:2)õi dharmasya paripanthinaþ|
vaiùamyam arthavidy(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü nairarthy(cid:2)t khy(cid:2)payanti te||
Those enemies of the law (dharma) who plunder the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, proclaim
nonsensically the harshness of the sciences of worldly affairs.287
The juxtaposition of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra, the ‘authoritative tradition’, with the
arthavidy(cid:2)s, the ‘sciences of practical matters’ is striking. While
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

284 “The theory of practice,” p.503; “The Idea of (cid:6)(cid:3)stra,” p.20.

286 Ibid., p.508.
287 ‘Nonsensically’ because their ‘plundering’ does not reveal the ‘true’ intent of
the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras.
286 CHAPTER SIX
Bh(cid:8)ùma himself would never argue that (cid:3)(cid:2)stra is out of step with
arthavidy(cid:2), indeed, he would argue quite the reverse, he clearly has in
mind those who would hold such a position. In the previous unit, it is
worth recalling, the (cid:3)vapaca berated Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra for not having the
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra as his ‘proper authority’ (pram(cid:2)õa)288 and, later, for not having
the Veda as his ‘source’ or ‘foundation’ (k(cid:2)raõa).289 It is precisely this
kind of selectivity and strict adherence to particular ‘authoritative tra-
ditions’ to which Bh(cid:8)ùma objects. Yudhiùñhira too is included in this
critique, as we shall later see, even if his preferences might be for dif-
ferent (cid:3)(cid:2)stras than the (cid:3)vapaca, given his tendency towards renuncia-
tion and non-violence. The point is that any insistence on just one kind
of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra is too limiting, and, in Yudhiùñhira’s case, makes effective
ruling impossible. People who hold such views are simply ignorant,
‘they are perpetually incompetent in the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras’ (sad(cid:2) … a(cid:3)(cid:2)stra-
ku(cid:3)al(cid:2)þ),290 and (140.14):
parimuùõanti (cid:3)(cid:2)str(cid:2)õi (cid:3)(cid:2)stradoù(cid:2)nudar(cid:3)inaþ|
vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nam atha vidy(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü na samyag iti vartate||
Considering the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras at fault they plunder the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras. It follows then
that their comprehension of the sciences [of artha?] is ‘that is not right’.
Vidy(cid:2) here most probably refers back to arthavidy(cid:2).291 It is not only
that such people insist on a rigorous adherence to the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, but that
they do not acknowledge those forms of knowledge that pertain to the
realities of ‘ordinary matters’, the particular field of endeavour a king
must specialise in. This would seem precisely to be the point of the
next stanza, which describes those who ‘publicise their own science
through the censure of others’ sciences’,292 people Bh(cid:8)ùma pointedly
calls ‘merchants in the sciences’ (vidy(cid:2)vaõijo) and r(cid:2)kùasas.293
Rather than this rigid adherence to selective (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, Bh(cid:8)ùma opens
up ways in which to make sense of the relationship between (cid:5)(cid:3)stric
prescription, dharma and political conduct. Firstly, he wants to free
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
288 139.66c. See above pp.275f.
289 139.85b. See above p.279.
290 140.13c.
291 Or, alternatively, it could mean the entirety of the sciences and the proper ap-
preciation of the role therein of arthavidy(cid:2).
292 140.15ab ninday(cid:2) paravidy(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü sv(cid:2)ü vidy(cid:2)ü khy(cid:2)payanti ye|
293 140.14ef. This is a pointed criticism of br(cid:3)hman authorities in the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras and
dharma, since, of course, they should not ordinarily (according to the very same
(cid:3)(cid:2)stras they would undoubtedly promote) be ‘merchants’ at all.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 287
the determination of dharma from the grip of such people (who, apart
from the (cid:3)vapaca, a ‘straw man’ in any case, are anonymous), and,
secondly, he wants to broaden the forum in which dharma can be de-
termined. (cid:7)(cid:2)stras used in isolation from intellectual argument and
learned contextualisation about their application are ineffective, since
no account is taken of the contingent nature of worldly affairs, thus
140.18:
svavin(cid:5)tena (cid:3)(cid:2)streõa vyavasyanti tath(cid:2)pare|
lokay(cid:2)tr(cid:2)m ihaike tu dharmam (cid:2)hur man(cid:5)ùiõaþ||
As surely as some draw judgements according to self-taught (cid:3)(cid:2)stras
[i.e., in isolation from debate],294 so others here who are clever declare
the law (dharma) to be a worldly matter.
Not even a paõóita ‘can by himself deliberate upon dharma as it has
been explained among the good’ (140.19), rather a wise man must
discuss dharma in an assembly (sam(cid:6)he),295 and the ‘(cid:3)(cid:2)stras then be-
come invisible’ ((cid:3)(cid:2)stram … y(cid:2)ty adar(cid:3)anam).296 A proclamation on
dharma is then ‘sanctioned by the tradition as it is passed down, by
the intellect, and by discussion’.297 It itself becomes ‘authoritative tra-
dition’ ((cid:2)gama, (cid:3)(cid:2)stra).298 Clearly Bh(cid:8)ùma is ambivalent about ‘tradi-
tion’. It is a hindrance in as much as its prescriptive authority under-
mines the king’s own authority to act in ways which might be politi-
cally necessary but scripturally questionable. Yet at the same time,
once something is regarded as (cid:3)(cid:2)stra, this very authority is its source
of strength.299 He therefore offers a pragmatic, if open-ended, solution
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
294 Fitzgerald understands this slightly differently, taking the sva in svavin(cid:5)ta in a
reflexive sense to mean simply that the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras have been ‘taught to them’. I think the
point being made is that the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras are learnt and taught in isolation from proper de-
bate about their meaning and application (perhaps, if a written text is assumed, they
studied them on their own), as the next stanza seems to corroborate. However, the
difference is not substantial.
295 140.20a. N(cid:8)lakaõñha glosses sam(cid:6)he with sabh(cid:2)y(cid:2)m. I am deeply indebted to
Fitzgerald’s brilliant translation of 140.20.
296 It may appear that Bh(cid:8)ùma here comes close to forsaking the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras totally. But
it seems more to the point that in the course of deliberating a point of dharma, of
‘what should be done’ in any particular event, the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras, which would have had their
place in the debate, then became subsumed by whatever deliberations take place.
297 140.20cd (cid:2)gat(cid:2)gamay(cid:2) buddhy(cid:2) vacanena pra(cid:3)asyate||
298 (cid:4)gama, as Pollock points out, is sometimes a synonym of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra, see “The the-
ory of practice,” p.504 n.29. Cf. N(cid:8)lakaõñha … tena pra(cid:3)asyate (cid:3)(cid:2)stram …, ‘… by this
it is sanctioned as (cid:3)(cid:2)stra …’
299 The authority granting aspect of ‘(cid:3)(cid:2)stra’ is the source of another tension that is
also evident in this text, for as Pollock (“Playing by the rules,” p.309 n.25) points out:
(cid:3)

(140.21): a ‘proclamation’ (vacana)—and by this we should under-
stand ‘a proclamation of dharma’—is ‘good’ (s(cid:2)dhu) ‘due to it bring-
ing about knowledge from ignorance’ (aj(cid:9)(cid:2)n(cid:2)j j(cid:9)(cid:2)nahetutv(cid:2)d), a rule
((cid:3)(cid:2)stra) he considers to not be useless (ap(cid:2)rthakam).
C. R(cid:4)JAN(cid:13)TI
What does all this have to do with the way in which kings rule?
Bh(cid:8)ùma brings us directly back to this very issue, drawing the previous
unit more clearly into the argument (140.23-4):
tena tvaü chinnam(cid:6)lena kaü toùayitum arhasi|
atathyavihitaü yo v(cid:2) nedaü v(cid:2)kyam up(cid:2)(cid:3)nuy(cid:2)t||

yay(cid:2) pramucyate tv anyo yadarthaü ca pramodate||
Who could you satisfy with this now that its foundation has been de-
stroyed—you who do not accept that those words [i.e. of the (cid:3)vapaca]
were wrongly contrived? For you have been created for terrible activity
alone, but you don’t realise it! You must realise this to enable royal pol-
icy to prosper! It freed that other one, and for it he rejoices.
The first stanza targets the (cid:3)vapaca’s rigorous position in the previous
unit, a rigor that Yudhiùñhira is prone to as well,300 which places undue
importance on strict adherence to certain kinds of (cid:3)(cid:2)stra and a certain
moral order. Bh(cid:8)ùma’s polemic has now destroyed this strict (cid:5)(cid:3)stric
foundation (m(cid:6)la), a foundation of dharma, of ‘the right thing to do’.
Yudhiùñhira’s proper royal behaviour, the ‘cruel action’ he so abhors,
is extolled as his proper activity. The ‘other one’ (anya) in 140.24e
must refer back to Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra from SU 12, clearly establishing (if it
has not been already) that the king’s necessarily lenient attitude to his
behaviour is meant to provide a pragmatic structure for all matters of
the king’s rule. Just as Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra ‘strove to prosper’ so should
Yudhiùñhira; and just as this striving stretched strict (cid:5)(cid:3)stric norms of
br(cid:3)hmaõic propriety, so Yudhiùñhira should understand the proper
place of the exigencies of royal policy in relation to dharma—indeed,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
“There was clearly a need, widely perceived in popular culture, for Vedic or transcen-
dent legitimacy, and just as clearly a resistance among the bestowers of that legiti-
macy—M(cid:8)m(cid:3)üs(cid:3)—to what it viewed as potential devaluation of the commodity.”
300 Or rather, Yudhiùñhira has a strict position, but it is not necessarily the
(cid:3)vapaca’s. As already argued, the point is to argue against all strict positions. The
king must be flexible.
LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 289
the dharmic nature of such policies. Bh(cid:8)ùma further elaborates that it is
only through the king’s harshness that an environment can be estab-
lished in which ‘people who are not harsh’ (nat(cid:5)kùõabh(cid:6)ta)—that is,
those who are members of the other non-martial varõas—can pursue
their ordinary livelihoods (y(cid:2)tr(cid:2)).301 It is this ability to establish con-
trol over his populace in order that it may flourish which separates the
‘civilised’ world of dharma ruled by a dharmic king, from the ad-
harmic bandits, barbarians and other outsiders not participating in or
exluded from br(cid:3)hmaõic civil life. In this regard, Bh(cid:8)ùma finally offers
a direct response to Yudhiùñhira’s opening pra(cid:3)na: the judicious use of
coercive power is ‘indeed the law which he [the bandit] would
spurn’.302 Thus Yudhiùñhira’s initial concern is turned on its head.
Rather than the adoption of a pragmatic Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra-like attitude to
conduct entailing a descent into lawless banditry, it is quite the re-
verse. Not to adopt such an attitude would allow lawless banditry to
overrun his kingdom. The king must be harsh (t(cid:5)kùõa), he must direct
his people in their svadharma, otherwise, recalling a familiar meta-
phor, they would eat each other ‘like wolves’ (140.27). He must sup-
press gangs of dasyus (140.28), rule the earth and protect his people
through dharma (140.29), and, reminding us again of Yudhiùñhira’s
equivocating nature (140.32):
kaùñaþ kùatriyadharmo ’yaü sauh(cid:8)daü tvayi yat sthitam|
ugre karmaõi s(cid:8)ùño ’si tasm(cid:2)d r(cid:2)jyaü pra(cid:3)(cid:2)dhi vai||
This warrior conduct is severe; [yet] it is benevolence that resides in
you! You were created for harsh deeds, therefore rule this kingdom!
D. BR(cid:2)HMANS
In the previous sequence of stanzas, Bh(cid:8)ùma has already instructed
Yudhiùñhira to work with br(cid:3)hmans in the governance of the kingdom.
Even if the king must, in some sense, become a ‘technician in the sa-
cred’, there are limits to this, and the authoritative position of the
br(cid:3)hman in respect to the sacred is always reinforced. This should be
expected of a text which, in all likelihood, was composed by br(cid:3)h-
mans with their own interests very much firmly in mind. Thus in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
301 140.25.
302 140.26cd eùaiva khalu mary(cid:2)d(cid:2) y(cid:2)m ayaü parivarjayet| 26ab establishes the
‘law’ (mary(cid:2)d(cid:2)) as ‘the fault in killing who should not be killed and in the non-killing
of who should be killed’ (yas tv avadhyavadhe doùaþ sa vadhyasy(cid:2)vadhe sm(cid:8)taþ).
290 CHAPTER SIX
140.29 the king is told to establish ‘high born ministers fully conver-
sant with the Veda’ (kul(cid:5)n(cid:2)n saciv(cid:2)n … vedavidy(cid:2)samanvit(cid:2)n) along-
side of whom he can rule the earth. And furthermore, in the following
stanza, he is warned against encouraging the low-born (vih(cid:5)naja) to
higher station, and of thinking that the low-born person has the same
rights as the high born. Presumably this means that while the king
should overlook a br(cid:3)hman’s apparent transgression of dharma (such
as by Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra), he should not overlook that of the ‘low-born’. ‘For
times of crisis’ ((cid:2)patsu), Indra advised, ‘always suppress the untrained
and protect the learned.’303
The privileged position of the br(cid:3)hman is made abundantly clear in
the closing sequence of stanzas. Echoing his initial pra(cid:3)na, Yudhi-
ùñhira poses another question to finally clarify the issue at stake: ‘Is
there a bandit’s law which that other one should not transgress?’304 In
answer to the question Bh(cid:8)ùma relates three stanzas that establish the
wise br(cid:3)hman as beyond his limits of jurisdiction. Once again, how-
ever, we are left with the difficult task of ascertaining the precise
meaning of this question, and especially of how to take dasyumar-
y(cid:2)d(cid:2)—the bandit’s law, limit or boundary. The repeated use of the
word mary(cid:2)d(cid:2) in the context of dasyus highlights again that from
some br(cid:3)hmaõic perspectives (though certainly not all) the concept of
dharma is bound to a socio-cultural complex from which the dasyu is
generally excluded, or at the very least marginalised. This exclusion
often extends to a geo-politics in which the dasyu is figured as living
on the margins of ‘br(cid:3)hmaõic’ territory, whether this is understood
simply as the village, or a broader notion of ‘sacred territory’ like
(cid:2)ry(cid:2)varta.305 The verb (cid:2)laïgh too suggests a possible territorial sub-
text to this question, since its general ‘transgressive’ semanticity can
take on spacial overtones (‘leap over, go beyond, overstep, traverse’)
which are further reinforced by the prefix ati. In a note to his transla-
tion Fitzgerald offers the interpretation,306 “Bh(cid:8)ùma’s exhortation to be
devoted to learned brahmins answers Yudhiùñhira’s question with a
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

304 140.34ab asti svid dasyumary(cid:2)d(cid:2) y(cid:2)m anyo n(cid:2)tilaïghayet| As with 140.24e
(see above p.288), I take anya here as referring to Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra. The implications, of
course, are far broader than merely Yudhiùñhira’s attitude towards that sage. Fitzger-
ald takes anya more generally, “Is there any law of the barbarians that others should
never violate?”

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 291
resounding ‘No’. Anything the brahmins ever find objectionable about
any barbarians should be eliminated by the king.” Undoubtedly
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s reply is a resounding “No”. But rather than speaking to the
br(cid:3)hmans’ attitude to barbarians, I would argue that there are two
more likely explanations. The first is to take dasyumary(cid:2)d(cid:2) as refer-
ring to the specific position of the ‘bandit’ (cid:3)vapaca in the story told in
the previous chapter. The question would then be, ‘Is there any law of
[strict position as enunciated by] the bandit that that other one [Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)-
mitra; br(cid:3)hmans in general] should not transgress?’307 This, of course,
achieves the remarkable feat of equating the championing of strict
(cid:5)(cid:3)stric adherence to a behaviour associated with people excluded from
br(cid:3)hmaõic conceptions of civil society. The second explanation is to
take this verse as saying, ‘Is there anything bandits do that br(cid:3)hmans
must never do?’ Accordingly, there is nothing the king should do to
stop the wise br(cid:3)hman from doing anthing he deems appropriate for
his situation. If he can eat dogs, if he can behave like a low-caste ban-
dit, can he do whatever he wants? Yes. And why? Because his learn-
ing, which gives him a special relationship to sacred authority, the
necessity of which is always stressed (e.g. 140.35), affords such br(cid:3)h-
mans a special status to adjudicate on matters of dharma. We are once
again in the realm of the learned br(cid:3)hman, the (cid:3)iùña, those whom the
tradition of the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras firmly establish as the effective (if not
the technical) sources of dharma, a status due them because of their
absorption of, and consequent ability to manifest, the sacred tradition.
So let us ask again our slightly altered version of White’s question:
can a non-renouncing, ruling king become a technician of the sacred?
Lying at the base of this question is the problem of the relationship
between the kùatriya (especially the king) and the br(cid:3)hman, and their
supposedly respective spheres of normative expertise: artha for the
king and dharma for the br(cid:3)hman. The bifurcation of these two social
classes and their spheres of operation has long been argued for by
scholars of ancient India. Dumont, for example, speaks of the secu-
larisation of the function of the king, in consequence of which the
king “lost his religious prerogatives”, and opposes the king’s realm of
“interest or advantage, artha” to the “dharma or universal order of the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
307 This would bring this question in to line with the first interpretation of the qest-
tion in 140.1 offered above p.281.
292 CHAPTER SIX
Brahman”, a universal order which, in turn, encapsulates the political
world of the king.308 Another scholar who has made much of this dis-
tinction is Heesterman, who, largely on the basis of a study of the
transformation of various royal rituals from their (reconstructed) ‘pre-
classical’ forms to their classical systemisations, identified as an “in-
soluble” problem the relationship between “ultimate authority” and
kingship.309 For Heesterman “dharma is beyond the king’s grasp and
his relationship with it is at best an uneasy one”, and “in matters of
dharma—that is in practically every aspect of his activity—he has no
autonomy whatsoever and, instead of leading, must follow”.310 Re-
cently, Lariviere has made an interesting critique of such views (espe-
cially Heesterman’s) which conceive a radical bifurcation of ‘power’
and ‘authority’,311 and indeed offers textual evidence of a case in
which the king is considered “the final judge in matters of dharma”.312
In particular, Lariviere criticises what he sees as br(cid:3)hmaõical parochi-
alism in the attention scholars pay to particular kinds of texts in their
interpretations of ancient Indian culture. What, then, might the current
text offer on this important question?
At first it seems that the text does suggest that the king has some
kind of authority in respect to dharma. Thus in section A it is stressed
that he too must explore the variations in dharmic prescription and the
relationship of dharma to the contingencies of the social world. It is
only through this that he can place in proper dharmic perspective the
behaviour of his subjects (paradigmatically br(cid:3)hmans) in seeking a
means of living, and whatever acts he himself must perform in order
to better establish the conditions for such livelihoods. It is impossible
to ignore the stress in these opening passages on both the constitutive
role that dharma plays in the responsibilities of the king, and his in-
terpretative role in applying dharma to his rule. However, this initial
positivism is progressively tempered as the text develops. While the

LAWS FOR A KING IN CRISIS 293
rigid adherence to the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras is questioned as a beneficial approach to
a pragmatic understanding and consequent application of dharma, the
determination of dharma within a learned congregation of experts (in
the Veda, in the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras) is promoted as the best way of undertaking
this process. While the king, it seems, has a participatory role in the
process, there is a strong sense of limitation being placed on his auton-
omy as the br(cid:3)hman assumes a more prominent role. This becomes
stronger again when the king, as we saw in D, is debarred from impos-
ing any jurisdiction over the ‘wise’ br(cid:3)hman.
It seems then, at least as this text would have it, that both positions
have merit. In the first case, in some applications of dharma the king
undoubtedly has autonomy. Indeed, as I have stressed elsewhere, the
(cid:2)DhP often suggests that the king must apply wisdom to properly
recognise the dharmic nature of his necessarily realpolitisch attitude
to restoring the kingdom to prosperity (and to dharma). In some sense,
therefore, the king must be a ‘technician of the sacred’ in order to see
how dharma relates to and is best served by his rule. On the other
hand, there are clear limits imposed on this, not unexpectedly, in the
sphere of the br(cid:3)hmans themselves. It is, of course, stating the obvious
to point to self-interest here. This text too is composed from the point
of view of the br(cid:3)hman. Clearly there is a need also, as Lariviere ar-
gues,313 to be attentive to different usages of dharma, and to the vary-
ing semantic scope implied in any given context. When Dumont and
Heesterman speak of the king’s isolation from the sacred (by which
they mean, of course, ‘dharma’), their paradigmatic examples seem to
be the rites over which a br(cid:3)hman presides in his function as ‘priest’.
It would be patently incorrect to assume for the text under scrutiny
here that the king was meant to use his wisdom in the application of
dharma in respect to the performance or formal procedure of a par-
ticular rite.314
But dharma has much broader implications than this, implications
that were always expanding as it became more and more conceptually
central to Indian culture. What sense of sacrality is implicated in any
particular usage of dharma? What is the relationship between a par-
ticular usage of dharma, and dharma as some kind of totality,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
313 “Power and authority,” p.322.
314 It was axiomatic that a king could not be both patron of a sacrifice (yajam(cid:2)na)
and the officant at a sacrifice (i.e. the priestly sacrificer). Such a figure combining
both roles is the object of scorn at Mbh 8.27.81 and 30.70-71.
294 CHAPTER SIX
Dumont’s ‘universal order’, with all its moral implications? These are
not questions for which I have a ready answer. However, what does
seem apparent is that the br(cid:3)hman, while very concerned to seal his
own ‘domain’ of dharma off from the executive power of the king,
was at the same time articulating this executive power in terms of
dharma too. Indeed, this was increasingly necessary in order to le-
gitimise the br(cid:3)hmaõic (and br(cid:3)hman-centric) view of kingship, as the
word dharma itself began to be used to legitimise any area of human
endeavour. But in articulating the responsibility, authority and ex-
ecutive power of the king in terms of dharma, it would appear that this
text anticipates the potential for br(cid:3)hmans’ own central and authorita-
tive relationship to dharma to be subjected to dispute. Even if this text
equivocates, it too can be said to speak to the tension between ‘author-
ity and power’ exposed by Heesterman and Dumont, the tension be-
tween the ‘sacred’ dimension of dharma, and the political dimension
of the king which, in the final analysis, enables the ‘eternal’ dharma to
survive at all in a contingent world.

CHAPTER SEVEN
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME:
TEXTS ON (cid:4)PADDHARMA II
The (cid:2)DhP now takes a somewhat new turn, both structurally and the-
matically. The four units analysed in this chapter form something of a
group in the (cid:2)DhP. While none of these units shares all those features
which set the four of them off from those that precede them, each
shares something in common with one or more of the other three. All
four units contain fables and their frames, while not inconsequential,
are relatively loose. In units 14, 15 and 16 the political (n(cid:5)ti) element
preoccupying many earlier texts mostly recedes. The thematic connec-
tion to issues of (cid:2)paddharma, as also explored in the units prior to
these four, is less pronounced too, a detail reflected in the language of
these texts, since they contain no instances of the word (cid:2)pad.1 From a
formal point of view, units 14, 15 and 17 share the feature of being
multi-chapter texts,2 and in addition units 16 and 17 have no pra(cid:3)na in
the Critical Edition. It makes sense, therefore, to think of these four
texts as forming a group.
7.1 ‘The dialogue between the dove and the hunter’
(Mbh 12.141-145; SU 14)
The text to be discussed in this section is the third longest in the
(cid:2)DhP. Its five separate chapters divide along narrative lines, as the
following summary indicates, with the tendency being for each chap-
ter to concern itself with the point of view of one of the characters in-
volved in the tale. This is further emphasised in some northern manu-
scripts (including Kinjawadekar’s edition) which divide the longer
chapter 142 into three, each of which follows the same tendency to
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1 The occurrence of (cid:2)paddharma in 151.34, outside the limits of the fable, will be
discussed below.
2 Cf. Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp. 147, 158, who notes that, as with the
RDhP, these multi-chapter texts tend to occur “in the middle or towards the back of
the collection [the (cid:2)DhP]”. See also above p.15 n.18.
296 CHAPTER SEVEN
divide at those points where the narrative concerns itself with the per-
spective of a different actor. These additional divisions are indicated
by the symbol § in the following summary:
141(cid:3) A savage bird-hunter wandered the earth killing and selling birds,
oblivious to his evil conduct. One day, a massive storm hit the forest in
which he was hunting. Unable to find shelter, the hunter became terri-
bly distressed by the cold, wind and rain. Seeing a large tree, he sought
shelter beneath its branches, and resolved to remain there until the
storm cleared.
142(cid:3) A dove lived in a branch of that tree. It had been his home for a
long time. His wife had gone out in the morning and had not returned
by day’s end. Thinking of the storm, the dove worried about her ab-
sence.
§(cid:3) His wife, in fact, was not far away, having been captured in one of
the hunter’s cages. Hearing him moan, she became concerned that she
was neglecting her husband. She encouraged him to receive the hunter
as his guest as duty demanded.
§(cid:3) At the sound of his wife’s voice, the dove was reduced to tears and
immediately did as she bid, properly honouring the hunter as his guest.
When the hunter begged for relief from the cold, the dove kindled a fire
with some dried leaves. But when asked for food, the dove had none to
offer, since, being a forest-dweller, he lived day to day. Cursing his life-
style for leaving him without food to offer guests, the dove wondered
how to satisfy the hunter’s hunger. Kindling the fire’s flames, the dove
circumambulated it three times and entered it.
143(cid:3) The bird-hunter, overwhelmed at seeing the dove enter the fire
and offer his flesh as food, was shamed into reevaluating his way of
life. He resolved to renounce his occupation and depart for a final great
journey (mah(cid:2)prasth(cid:2)na).
144(cid:3) Grieving at the loss of her husband, the female dove recalled how
good he was to her and how much she loved him. Despairing at the
prospect of a widow’s life, she followed her husband into the blazing
fire. In the flame’s midst she saw him on a celestial vehicle and joined
him to live happily together.
145(cid:3) The hunter, seeing those two standing on the divine vehicle, re-
solved upon his ‘great journey’. Slowly walking, he fasted and became
very emaciated, even ignoring an inviting pond of cold water. Entering
a forest, thorns tore at his skin. A wind blew, and with the rubbing of
the trees a fire started. It burnt ferociously and the hunter, desiring free-
dom from his body, entered the flames. Consumed by the fire, he joined
the doves in heaven.
This fable is offered as a response to Yudhiùñhira’s initial request in
the opening stanza to ‘tell me about the dharma of one who maintains
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 297
a refuge’ ((cid:3)araõaü p(cid:2)lay(cid:2)nasya yo dharmas taü vadasva me).
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial response (141.2-4) gives the tale the barest political
context, framing it in terms of the responsibilities of the king to pro-
tect those ‘who have come for refuge’ ((cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gata).3 He then cites the
tale of the dove with the following well-known stanza (141.4):
(cid:3)r(cid:6)yate hi kapotena (cid:3)atruþ (cid:3)araõam (cid:2)gataþ|
p(cid:6)jita(cid:3) ca yath(cid:2)ny(cid:2)yaü svai(cid:3) ca m(cid:2)üsair nimantritaþ||
For it’s taught that an enemy went to a dove for refuge and was hon-
oured according to rule and invited to eat the dove’s own flesh.
This verse is also cited in the R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa and the Pa(cid:9)catantra where
the same ‘moral’ is taught.4 Apparently the story was sufficiently well
known for this one verse to evoke the entire fable and the proper mo-
rality associated with correct conduct towards guests, especially in the
case that they are enemies. This is not, however, the only reason for
which this tale has been utilised in other texts. J. Leslie has docu-
mented how the late eighteenth century Str(cid:5)dharmapaddhati’s version
of the tale illustrates that a good wife who is devoted to her husband
(pativrat(cid:2)) should serve and follow him regardless of her own life.5
These functional differences in the fable’s citation are an indication of
its relative complexity, allowing it to be read from a number of differ-
ent perspectives.6 This narrative complexity is especially indicated by
and conveyed through its shifts in perspective, allowing different the-
matic elements to be addressed in each case.
Undoubtedly this tale finds a place in the (cid:2)DhP because it dramati-
cally represents a situation of distress in order to highlight various as-
pects of dharma. While there is the barest effort in the frame to place

298 CHAPTER SEVEN
this text in a political framework, it belongs closer to issues pertaining
to dharma.7 Indeed, as we have already seen, a political text like the
KA is far more likely to instruct the king to take advantage of an en-
emy who is in distress rather than offer him shelter (unless, of course,
it would be to his own advantage to do otherwise).8 The strongest
themes of this text revolve around, firstly, the interrelated issues of
how to treat a guest (atithi) and str(cid:5)dharma, the latter especially as it
relates to a woman’s ‘loyalty to her husband’ (pativrat(cid:2)), which fur-
ther brings into play her duty to follow her husband, even into death.
Secondly, this text presents an unusually catholic idea of dharma in
the hunter’s ‘conversion’ to it, and, in so doing, marries ascetic prac-
tices with the absolution achieved through penance. Finally, in the
bird’s self-immolation, it mingles an affirmation of the importance of
individuals fulfiling their own proper duties (svadharma) and the sig-
nificance of the householder’s obligations with ideas reflecting the
influence of the ethical traditions of yoga, a mingling expressed by the
dove’s fulfliment of atithip(cid:6)jana through his self-sacrifice, thereby
ensuring his salvation.
While the text initially frames this fable in terms of the protection of a
(cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gata, a person ‘who has come for refuge’, it soon combines this
with the conceptually similar framework of atithip(cid:6)jana, the ‘proper
honouring of a guest’. Rules of hospitality held an important place in
ancient India. Indeed, atithip(cid:6)jana was regarded as one of the five
mah(cid:2)yaj(cid:9)as, the ‘great sacrifices’, that the householder was obliged to
perform each day, as the dove explains to the hunter in a stanza link-
ing together the two ideas of (cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gata and atithip(cid:6)jana (142.25):9
(cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gatasya kartavyam (cid:2)tithyam iha yatnataþ|

(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
7 This is not to say that this political aspect is not germane to the fable. Indeed, the
citation of (cid:2)DhP 141.4 in both the R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa and the Pa(cid:9)catantra reveal the conver-
gence of the political domain with a particular issue of dharma as well.

and the Caste System,” Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik, 20 (1996), pp.523f.; and
Jamison, Sacrificed Wife, especially ch. IV. The term (cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gata usually occurs in the
dharma literature in a negative context, i.e., not offering shelter to a (cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gata is an
example of a sin which must be absolved through pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta, see MS 11.190, 198;
ViS 36.1, 7, 54.32. See also (cid:2)DhP 137.16.
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 299
In this world, hospitality should eagerly be offered to one who has
come for protection, especially by a householder who undertakes the
five sacrifices.
It is the obligations of hospitality that push the dove towards his dra-
matic self-immolation, since he must offer the hunter food as part of
the atithip(cid:6)jana observances, and he has no stores of food due to his
forest-dwelling lifestyle.10 Yet, the dove only resolves to welcome the
hunter as his guest after his wife has convinced him that undertaking
p(cid:6)j(cid:2) for the hunter is his proper duty (dharma), leading to the ‘non-
decaying worlds’ (lok(cid:2)n akùay(cid:2)n) upon death (142.18). Conversely, to
kill a person who has come for refuge would be a sin equivalent to
killing a br(cid:3)hman (dvija) or a cow (142.16).11 His wife argues that a
dove’s way of life (v(cid:8)tti) is prescribed for them by j(cid:2)tidharma ‘the
laws of their species’ (142.17), and encourages her husband, now that
he has ensured his line of descent (saüt(cid:2)nava) by having children, to
give up his compassion (day(cid:2)) for his own body (142.19).12
It is of some significance that it is the female dove who impels her
husband to perform his proper hospitality rites, since the proper duties
of a wife and her role in respect of her husband are also central themes
of this fable, themes which are the reasons for its citation in the Str(cid:5)-
dharmapaddhati. Most of these elements are found in two sections:
firstly in her husband’s speech in 142.2-10,13 and secondly in chapter
144, when the female dove reflects on her life with her husband and
decides to follow him into death. In the first case, in mourning her
absence, the dove reflects on and celebrates his wife’s devoted at-
tention to her matrimonial duties, shifting from a personal reflection
on her unique qualities (142.4-7), to general statements on what con-
stitutes a good wife (142.8-10). Notably, given the female dove’s role
in pushing her husband to perform atithip(cid:6)jana, he says in 142.10cd,
‘in this world there is no companion equal to a wife as a means of ful-
filling dharma’ (n(cid:2)sti bh(cid:2)ry(cid:2)samo loke sah(cid:2)yo dharmas(cid:2)dhanaþ).
While the male dove’s reflections are somewhat sentimental, most
of the more prescriptive facets of a wife’s duties come from the fe-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
10 Cf. Jamison, Sacrificed Wife, pp.162f., who cites this story as indicative of the
strict obligations involved in hospitality rituals.
11 Cf. Bh(cid:8)ùma’s concluding statement in 145.18; and also ViS 36.1.

obligations.

male dove. Despite being captured by the hunter, she encourages her
husband to welcome him as his guest largely out of her own concern
that she was neglecting him (142.12ab), ‘she whose husband is not
content is said to be no woman at all’.14 The wife, it seems, plays a
crucial role in keeping her husband to his duties as a householder, as
142.10 has already suggested. In chapter 144 the tone is somewhat
different. In many ways, this passage parallels the male dove’s
bh(cid:2)ry(cid:2)pra(cid:3)aüs(cid:2) in 142.2-10, since his wife sentimentally reflects
upon and celebrates both her own husband, and ‘husbands’ in general.
Having said this, it is also true that there is a tendency to focus more
on the female dove’s conduct towards her husband, rather than the
other way around. The predominant sense of this passage is that, with
her husband dead, the female dove’s life is devoid of meaning. This
point is initially made in personal terms, as in 144.5:
(cid:2)k(cid:2)(cid:3)agamane caiva sukhit(cid:2)haü tvay(cid:2) sukham|
vih(cid:8)t(cid:2)smi tvay(cid:2) k(cid:2)nta tan me n(cid:2)dy(cid:2)sti kiü cana||
While flying through the sky you joyously made me happy. You took
pleasure in me, love; now I have none of that.
But the general point is also being made that without a husband a
wife’s life has lost its secure foundation, if not its purpose, as in
144.7-8, which represents the counterpoint to 142.10cd cited above:
n(cid:2)sti bhart(cid:8)samo n(cid:2)tho na ca bhart(cid:8)samaü sukham|
vis(cid:8)jya dhanasarvasvaü bhart(cid:2) vai (cid:3)araõaü striy(cid:2)þ||

patih(cid:5)n(cid:2)pi k(cid:2) n(cid:2)r(cid:5) sat(cid:5) j(cid:5)vitum utsahet|
There is no protector equal to a husband, and no happiness equal to a
husband. Having left behind her own wealth, a husband is a wife’s only
refuge. Nothing can be done now without you living, lord. Bereft of her
husband, what virtuous wife is able to live?
The use of the word sat(cid:5) in 8d has particular resonance, since it mir-
rors her act of entering the fire and joining her husband in heaven. Be-
tween the life of poverty that is the lot of a widow and the heroic
‘choice’ of following her husband into the fire and attaining salvation,
the widowed dove, ‘loyal to her husband’ (pativrat(cid:2)), chooses the lat-
ter (144.9).15 Bh(cid:8)ùma emphasises the point in his CS in chapter 145.

DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 301
The wife ‘loyal to her husband’ (pativrat(cid:2)) goes to heaven (145.14)
and, in a clear vindication of the wife’s choice to self-immolate,
145.15:
y(cid:2)pi caivaüvidh(cid:2) n(cid:2)r(cid:5) bhart(cid:2)ram anuvartate|
vir(cid:2)jate hi s(cid:2) kùipraü kapot(cid:5)va divi sthit(cid:2)||
Such is the woman who follows her husband, for, like the female pi-
geon, she is radiant the instant he is in heaven.
The final themes of this narrative that I wish to explore revolve around
the hunter’s decision to adopt a ‘dharmic’ path, and the dove’s act of
self-immolation. Fitzgerald has discussed how the bird-hunter’s expia-
tion of his sinful way of life, and his adoption of a ‘yogic’ path of
dharma, mirrors the dasyu’s pursuance of dharma in SU 6 ((cid:2)DhP
133).16 Like the dasyu, the hunter in this fable is considered a de-
graded person, as his description in 141.10-15 indicates, and as sug-
gested by lubdhaka, ‘greedy’, the appellation used here for ‘hunter’.17
As Fitzgerald points out, this episode reveals that such an abominable
person can reform his adharmic ways, and be ‘converted’ to a particu-
lar idea of dharma,18 an idea built around the penitential value of as-
cetic practice. In ‘offering his body’ (dehaprad(cid:2)na) as an act of atithi-
p(cid:6)jana (143.8), a self-sacrifice fulfilling the demands of one of the
‘great sacrifices’ incumbent on the householder, the bird embarrasses
the hunter into pursuing dharma, the ‘highest path’ (param(cid:2) gatiþ).
Giving up his evil way of life as someone who ‘lived upon birds’
(pakùij(cid:5)vana),19 the hunter resolves upon a ‘great journey’ (mah(cid:2)pra-
sth(cid:2)na), the intention to fast and walk towards the Him(cid:3)layas until

death.20 Of course, in the end, he resolves upon another form of ritual
suicide, and enters a forest fire (145.10-11).21 Through his asceticism
the hunter expiates the crimes of his sinful way of life, and attains
heaven alongside the two doves (145.13-14). The tale clearly articu-
lates an idea of dharma incorporating ascetic practice for the removal
of the stains of the worst moral crimes. In its depiction of a relatively
catholic notion of dharma—a notion quite different from other more
orthodox br(cid:3)hmaõic conceptions of dharma that typically exclude fig-
ures like the hunter—it projects an image that reduces ascetic practice
to a penitential exercise in personal transformation. This reduction is
especially notable in relation to the dove’s pursuance of g(cid:8)hastha-
dharma, and speaks to a systemic integration of different articulations
of dharma that resonates with another systemisation, the br(cid:3)hmaõic
restriction of asceticism to a practice suitable for old age, as articu-
lated, for example, in the classical (cid:2)(cid:3)rama system.
The dove reflects a somewhat different ethos from the hunter’s.
When requested for food the dove is unable to offer any since, as a
‘forest-dweller’ (vanaukaùa), he only ‘lives by what turns up’ (utpan-
nena hi j(cid:5)v(cid:2)mo …),22 ‘like sages in the forest, we don’t have stores of
food’ (saücayo n(cid:2)sti c(cid:2)sm(cid:2)kaü mun(cid:5)n(cid:2)m iva k(cid:2)nane).23 Despairing at
his poverty, the dove curses his own ‘way of life’ (v(cid:8)tti), which has
left him without a means to properly honour his guest (142.36). En-
couraged by his wife to pursue the proper dharma of a householder
(g(cid:8)hastha) and honour the hunter as his guest, and asked by the hunter
for food, the bird is left in a quandary. He must offer his guest some
food, otherwise he would be breaking the code of hospitality a house-
holder must follow; but his bird’s way of life has left him without the
means to do so. The only option is to offer himself as food, a gesture
which, however, is in accordance with his j(cid:2)tidharma, as his wife re-
minds him: birds are the food of hunters of birds. The sacrificial im-
agery of his self-immolation is clear: kindling the hut(cid:2)(cid:3)ana, the ‘obla-
tion eater’, he circumambulates the fire three times and enters. In sac-
rificing himself as the oblation, the dove fulfils the demands of the

‘great sacrifice’ of atithip(cid:6)jana and, hence, the demands of the house-
holder’s dharma (see e.g. 142.18, 25-6), and immediately goes to
heaven. The dove’s sacrifice mingles a particular br(cid:3)hmaõic under-
standing of dharma—which valorises the sacrificing householder and
regards the individual’s performance of his own proper duty (sva-
dharma) as the highest moral consideration—with notions reflecting a
yogic ethos.24 The former is especially underlined when, despite curs-
ing his ‘way of life’ which leaves him without a store of food, the bird
attains salvation by keeping to his bird’s ‘way of life’ (his j(cid:2)tidharma)
and fulfilling his obligations as a householder (to be a father, husband
and sacrificer). The dove’s yogic ethos, on the other hand, is reflected
in his fiery self-sacrifice, his generosity and his temperate forest-
dwelling life-style. In contrast, however, the hunter’s proper way of
life (hunting) excludes him from salvation, and his adoption of a yogic
path is figured as a means to absolve the crimes of his lifestyle
through ascetic practice, for it is only then that he can join the birds in
heaven.
Once the hunter’s suicide in the forest fire and subsequent ascen-
sion to heaven have been described in the final chapter (145.1-13),
Bh(cid:8)ùma gives an account in the last five verses of each of the story’s
heroes according to their conduct and ensuing rewards: all three went
to heaven through their pure deeds (puõyena karmaõ(cid:2)) (145.14). Just
like the female dove, a woman who ‘follows her husband’ (bhart(cid:2)ram
anuvartate) shines in heaven (145.15). This was the ‘righteous path
through auspicious action’ (dharmiùñh(cid:2) gatiþ puõyena karmaõ(cid:2)) of
the dove and hunter (145.16). And, echoing the opening frame (141.2-
4), ‘this is the great dharma’ (mah(cid:2)n eùa dharmo) through which even
cow-killers (goghna) can be absolved, ‘but there would be no atone-
ment for a person who would kill someone who has come for refuge’
(niùk(cid:8)tir na bhavet tasmin yo hany(cid:2)c charaõ(cid:2)gatam).25 Each of these
perspectives offers a different view on what this fable is about. The
closing statements in 145.14-18—which bring together all three of the
narrative’s perspectives, the dove’s, his wife’s and the hunter’s—
make it clear that this complexity is an integral part of its presentation
in the (cid:2)DhP.

304 CHAPTER SEVEN
Returning once again to the structure of the presentation of this fable,
we note that it shares a number of formal features with other n(cid:5)ti fable
literature. Just as insights into the formal nature of framing structures
as narrative devices have suggested developmental paths for narrative
literature, other formal characteristics in the presentation of fables,
characteristics shared by some fables in the Mbh and the fables of the
Pa(cid:9)catantra, may clarify the development of Sanskrit fable literature.
In an article comparing the Pa(cid:9)catantra with Aesop’s fables, Sarah
Tsiang and Albert Watanabe have described a trait they call “circular
organization”, found typically in the Pa(cid:9)catantra: “The moral is in-
troduced at the start (or more precisely at the end of the preceding
story, which serves as an introduction to the present one). The story
then follows and the moral may only be referred to at the end (only the
first words being reiterated).”26 This is closely mirrored in the way this
unit presents the ‘tale of the dove’. Bh(cid:8)ùma introduces the fable with
an epitome of its moral in 141.3-4, the latter stanza of which also in-
troduces the P(cid:4)rõabhadra Pa(cid:9)catantra (at the end of the story that
precedes it). Yudhiùñhira then asks him to relate the fate of the dove in
greater detail (141.5), and Bh(cid:8)ùma responds with the entire story. Fi-
nally, the moral of the fable is recapitulated in stanza 145.18 (with
somewhat different wording).27 While this ‘circular’ structure is typi-
cal of other fables in the (cid:2)DhP, it is Yudhiùñhira’s request for the tell-
ing of the full tale in 141.528 that especially reveals this text’s close
formal similarity with the Pa(cid:9)catantra, since in it too the narrator’s
interlocutor typically asks for a fable to be told in full after it has been
introduced with an initial stanza. This feature especially differentiates
the text in this SU from most other tales narrated in the (cid:2)DhP, though
not SU 28, as we shall later see. An indicator such as this—especially
when coupled with its ‘multi-chapter’ presentation and, from a the-
matic point of view, its reduced political context and concern for more
personalised forms of ‘conduct in distress’—might provide grounds
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
26 “The Pa(cid:9)catantra and Aesop’s Fables: A comparison of rhetorical structure in
classical Indian and western literature,” Studies in the Linguistic Sciences, 17.1
(1987), pp.141f. Tsiang and Watanabe contrast this structure with the linear organisa-
tion of Aesop’s fables which begin “with a line introducing the characters and de-
scribing a situation. The narration of events follows and the story concludes with a
moral” (ibid., p.141).
27 Cf. Renou, “Les divisions,” p.22.

p.184 above.
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 305
upon which to build a criteria for hypothesising stages in a redactorial
history of the (cid:2)DhP, since such factors could potentially serve as evi-
dence for editorial decisions made by a different redactorial agency
than was responsible for the previous sequence of units (SUs 1-12).29
Yet, even though the perspective of this text differs from those ear-
lier units, it does bring into play themes found in them as well, and
hence shows a contiguity with them. In the hunter’s shaming and sub-
sequent commitment to pursue dharma—meritorious behaviour lead-
ing to beneficent worlds—this tale evokes a theme articulated earlier
in the (cid:2)DhP in which those normally cast outside the pale of br(cid:3)h-
maõic socio-cultural norms are represented as meaningfully participat-
ing in them.30 In addition Bh(cid:8)ùma’s framing stanzas in 141.2-3 and
145.18 invite readings of this tale—especially perhaps by Bh(cid:8)ùma’s
co-interlocutor, King Yudhiùñhira—that allegorise the responsibilities
of royal life. In the case of 141.2-3, the moral of the tale is articulated
as the duty of kings to provide shelter for those who seek it, a moral
which in the 145.18 is reiterated and combined with another, that most
evil conduct can be absolved, a theme linking it not only to the next
unit (SU 15), but also to SUs 5, 12 and 15. The first of these morals
asks the king to identify with the male dove in his provision of food
and shelter despite his poverty, thereby evoking—through the well-
defined and culturally central paradigm of the householder as epito-
mised in the dove’s commitment to atithip(cid:6)jana and (cid:3)araõ(cid:2)gata—the
king’s duties of protection (p(cid:2)lana, rakùaõa) and generosity (d(cid:2)na).31
This moral is juxtaposed with the other, which, in its provision of ab-
solution for evil conduct (even ‘cow-killing’), invites the king to iden-
tify with the hunter, whose designation lubdhaka even suggests the
often derided ‘greedy’ king.32 In this respect it speaks to familiar prob-
lems: the limits to the king’s behaviour and the problem of the king’s
own personal salvation in light of his politically expedient conduct in
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
29 Though I do not wish to imply that units 1-12 were necessarily redacted by the
same hand. This is an open question.
30 Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.161.
31 Simon Brodbeck (personal communication) has suggested that the most obvious
lesson for a king is ‘Even in (cid:2)pad, when (by your standards) you’re broke, you must
still perform kingly d(cid:2)na.’
32 Especially Mbh 12.7.7 discussed above p.140, in which Yudhiùñhira despairs at
the P(cid:3)õóavas greed for a kingdom, which (in his eyes), has brought them to the brink
of ruin. It is, of course, subsequently Bh(cid:8)ùma’s task to convince Yudhiùñhira that one
can rule without greed, cf. p.148 above.
306 CHAPTER SEVEN
the face of other, more absolute, articulations of ‘good conduct’, prob-
lems placed in relief because of the context of the (cid:2)DhP, which so
often portrays political expediency in ‘times of distress’. Framing
stanzas such as 141.3 and 145.18 point the way to a reading of this
text that imposes limits to what the king can do and still be eligible for
some avenues of absolution. In this it lends its voice to a loose articu-
lation of a theory of kingship which holds the king’s own self-
restraint, in spite of his overwhelming power, to be his most important
virtue.
7.2 ‘The dialogue between Indrota and P(cid:2)rikùita’
(Mbh 12.146-148; SU 15)
Like the previous unit, SU 15 concerns itself with the consequences of
‘evil’ deeds. N(cid:8)lakaõñha explicitly contrasts this text’s treatment of
evil (p(cid:2)pa) brought about ‘accidentally’ (abuddhip(cid:6)rva) with the ex-
ample of the hunter in the previous text, who performed evil know-
ingly (buddhip(cid:6)rva).33 Yudhiùñhira opens the text in the first stanza by
asking how someone ‘who would accidentally do evil’ (abuddhip(cid:6)r-
vaü yaþ p(cid:2)paü kury(cid:2)d …) ‘is freed from that evil’ (mucyate sa …
enasas).34 Bh(cid:8)ùma replies by relating the ancient itih(cid:2)sa of the conver-
sation between a ‘King Janamejaya’ and Indrota (cid:6)aunaka. Brief ver-
sions of this story, which relates Janamejaya’s cleansing from the sin
of brahminicide (brahmahaty(cid:2)) through an a(cid:3)vamedha performed by
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
33 The term buddhip(cid:6)rva does not, however, appear in the previous unit.
34 There is considerable material in the dharma literature on crimes viewed in
terms of intentionality, the key terms typically being [a]k(cid:2)matas, [a]j(cid:9)(cid:2)na[tas] or
[a]matip(cid:6)rva (see e.g. GDhS 12/49; 20.8-9; BDhS 2.1.6; 2.4.14; VDhS 20.19; MS
6.69; 8.264, 288; 9.242; 11.89, 127, 145, 146, 150, 160, 175, 232; YS 2.162; 3.226,
307). See in general Terence P. Day, The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian
Literature, Canadian Corp. for Studies in Religion, 1982, pp.101-5. In personal com-
munication, Simon Brodbeck has perceptively suggested a link between such a dis-
tinction and the theories of karma promoted by the Buddha and by K(cid:7)ùõa in the BhG,
in which ‘intention’ is distinguished from the act itself. Consequently “the ‘sin-value’
of an action is not discernible to ordinary witnesses of that action” [Brodbeck’s em-
phasis]. The wash-up of this is that crimes can become subject to an infinitely flexible
criterion in establishing the degree of their criminality, potentially switching, for ex-
ample, a charge of murder to a charge of involuntary manslaughter. The usefulness of
such a conception for a king ‘in crisis’, bent on utilising his daõóa in all manner of
intemperate ways, needs hardly to be mentioned. For importance of a philosophically
sophisticated discussion of such matters and more, see Simon Brodbeck, “Calling
K(cid:7)ùõa’s Bluff: Non-attached Action in the Bhagavadg(cid:5)t(cid:2),” JIP, 32 (2004): pp.81-103.

Indrota, are also narrated in (cid:6)B 13.5.4.1-3,35 Harivaü(cid:3)a 22.7-12, and
numerous pur(cid:2)õas, the latter following the Harivaü(cid:3)a.36 The Hari-
vaü(cid:3)a version adds the additional information that the br(cid:3)hman victim
was the son of the (cid:8)ùi Garga. None of the other versions, however,
make mention of the ‘accidental’ nature of the brahminicide, which is
central to the tale here. Indeed, the Harivaü(cid:3)a gives Janamejaya the
motivation of responding to abuse from the (cid:8)ùi’s son.37
As with SU 14, this is a multi-chapter text and, again, the divisions
within the text fall quite neatly along narrative lines: firstly, Janame-
jaya’s predicament, his approach to Indrota and the latter’s subsequent
repudiation of him; secondly, the ‘reform’ of Janamejaya, and In-
drota’s agreement to teach him; and finally, Indrota’s teaching. This is
demonstrated in the following summary:
146(cid:3) Once there was a king called Janamejaya, the son of Parikùit, who
accidentally (abuddhip(cid:6)rvam) committed brahminicide (brahmahaty(cid:2)).
All the br(cid:3)hmans and his people abandoned him. Burning with grief, he
went to the forest and practiced ascetic austerities. He sought out the
br(cid:3)hman Indrota (cid:6)aunaka and, kneeling before him, grasped his feet in
supplication. Indrota was disgusted by the br(cid:3)hman-killer, sternly re-
buking him for his evil action and for approaching him. As a result of
Janamejaya’s evil action, the br(cid:3)hman said, the king’s ancestors, de-
scendants and he himself would all go to hell.
147(cid:3) Janamejaya conceded his guilt, but asked Indrota how he can go
on living with the terrible consequences of his behaviour. Despairing of
his own salvation and for the future of his descendants, he promised
that he would again provide for br(cid:3)hmans. He asked Indrota for advice.
Indrota told him not to give up hope. If he regretted what he had done,
then Janamejaya must perform a great rite to appease the br(cid:3)hmans, and
to attain the ‘other world’. Janamejaya admitted his feelings of guilt.
(cid:6)aunaka asked him to properly pursue dharma and attend to the welfare
of all his subjects. Despite risking the censure of others for showing
Janamejaya how to absolve his sins, Indrota insisted on doing so for the

308 CHAPTER SEVEN
sake of the safety of br(cid:3)hmans. He made Janamejaya promise never to
hurt a br(cid:3)hman again.
148(cid:3) Once Janamejaya promised never to hurt a br(cid:3)hman again, In-
drota agreed to explain dharma to him. He told Janamejaya that people
will look upon his austerities with benevolence, since it is unusual for a
king to perform them. He described a number of means of purification
(pavitra), the best thing for a king to do, and numerous ways for a per-
son to free himself from evil and absolve sin. Finally, he narrated a
short dialogue, between the gods and asuras and their priest B(cid:7)haspati,
to the effect that if evil is done accidentally, then it is through doing
good that it is removed. After finishing speaking, Indrota assisted
Janamejaya in an A(cid:5)vamedha. Then the king, cleansed of his evil and
accompanied by royal splendour ((cid:3)r(cid:5)), returned to his own kingdom.
While the orientation of the text is provided by Yudhiùñhira’s opening
pra(cid:3)na, its central message is contained in the brief dialogue between
B(cid:7)haspati and ‘the suras and asuras’ on the (cid:2)DhP’s highest level of
interlocution as mapped in FIGURE 7, a message reiterated by (cid:6)aunaka
in stanzas 148.31-3, which form the concluding statements to the di-
dactic element of the text.38 The triùñubh in 148.30 spoken by B(cid:7)has-
pati is essentially an epitome of the moral contained in this text:
k(cid:8)tv(cid:2) p(cid:2)paü p(cid:6)rvam abuddhip(cid:6)rvaü puõy(cid:2)ni yaþ kurute buddhi-
p(cid:6)rvam|
sa tat p(cid:2)paü nudate puõya(cid:3)(cid:5)lo v(cid:2)so yath(cid:2) malinaü kù(cid:2)rayukty(cid:2)||
Having accidentally acted evilly in the past, whoever intentionally does
good things, and is inclined to merit, removes this evil, just as dirty
clothes are cleansed by soap.39
Though the problem of evil and its absolution concerns the entire text,
it is especially evident in chapter 148, an eclectic collection of texts
analysed schematically in FIGURE 12. This chapter contains this unit’s
most overt didactic statements, presenting (cid:6)aunaka’s teachings to
Janamejaya on the subject of how to put right his evil conduct, his
brahminicide. In its eclecticism this chapter clearly contrasts with the
first two chapters of this text (146-7), which are governed more by the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
38 This is why Bh(cid:8)ùma only provides the concluding statements to the narrative in
148.34-5, not to the didactus of the text, since this would be redundant. See also above
p.184.
39 Yudhiùñhira makes a similar argument to Arjuna at (cid:6)P 7.34 (see p.141 n.21
above). In that case, by ‘goodness’ (kaly(cid:2)õa) Yudhiùñhira means renouncing from the
world and becoming an ascetic, as the remainder of (cid:6)P 7 makes clear. It is pertinent to
mention here that (cid:6)P 7.13 is a variant of (cid:2)DhP 146.13.
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 309
tale’s narrative concerns. Indeed it reads and to some extent even pre-
sents itself as a composite of materials on a specific range of topics.
This auto-presentation of its composite nature is especially evident in
its number of citations: 148.9 is described in 148.8 as a quote from
Yay(cid:3)ti; 148.13 is from an anonymous ‘he’ (some northern manu-
scripts insert manur abrav(cid:5)t40); 148.14-15 are said (in 148.13) to be
from Satyavat; 148.26 from Manu; and finally stanzas 148.28-30 pre-
sent the dialogue between B(cid:7)haspati and the suras and asuras. But its
eclecticism goes beyond the citation of these sagacious men.
Two places in the text seem to especially suggest themselves as be-
ing the products of some kind of process of expansion, firstly in the
passage 148.6-15 and secondly in 148.22-30. At what point in the
text’s history this may have occurred—whether at the formative stage
of the text’s incorporation and/or composition in the (cid:2)DhP, or at some
later stage by the hand of some other redactorial agency—is an open
question, though the former possibility is at least as likely as the latter.
The first passage immediately follows the opening of the chapter in
148.1-5, in which Indrota congratulates Janamejaya on his pursuance
of dharma and tapas (note the near conflation of the two here). In the
two subsequent stanzas (148.6-7), Indrota eulogises tapas as the
‘highest means of purification for kings’ (r(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)ü paramaü pavitraü).
In these verses the tone, in keeping with 148.1-5, is still personal, and
Janamejaya is directly addressed by name (148.7b) or epithet
(p(cid:8)thiv(cid:5)pate—148.6b). Then, as FIGURE 12 shows, a sequence of stan-
zas appears which mostly concerns the topic of pavitra. These, how-
ever, no longer have the intimacy of the direct address mode of 148.6-
7, but are rather less contextualised, reflecting an aphoristic style de-
void of much continuity from one statement to the next. The overall
impression is that once the theme of pavitra, the ‘means of puri-
fication’, was introduced in 148.6-7, similarly themed stanzas were
collected together to form a sequence of aphorisms on pavitra, on
ways to purify oneself from sin.41
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
40 Fitzgerald also suggests this is probably from Manu (The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7,
p.554). Cf. E.W. Hopkins, “On the Professed Quotations from Manu found in the
Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,” JOAS, 11 (1885), p.260.
41 Admittedly, this theme is less clear for stanzas 148.14-15, which pose their own
interpretative problems (see also Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.769). How-
ever, they are thematically connected to this sequence through the problem of evil
(p(cid:2)pa), and their mode of discourse is clearly disconnected from the earlier personal-
ised tone that distinguishes stanzas 148.6-7.

Janamejaya performs an A(cid:5)vamedha with (cid:6)aunaka, absolves his sin and
34-5
regains his right to rule.
A similar pattern is evident in the second passage, 148.22-30. After
the somewhat eclectic and aphoristic collection of stanzas in 148.6-15,
verses 148.16-21 return to addressing Janamejaya more directly with
second person pronouns and verbs, and to the particular circumstances
of Janamejaya’s own sin—his mistreatment of br(cid:3)hmans—one of
whom he has ‘accidentally’ killed.42 In contrast to this prior behaviour,
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
42 Stanza 148.20 stands alone somewhat, though it is concerned with the theme of
kingship.
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 311
Indrota instructs Janamejaya on how, as a king, he should act, espe-
cially towards br(cid:3)hmans, as in 148.18:
yathaivain(cid:2)n pur(cid:2)kùaips(cid:5)s tathaivain(cid:2)n pras(cid:2)daya|
api dhikkriyam(cid:2)õo ’pi tyajyam(cid:2)no ’py anekadh(cid:2)||
Since you insulted them [the br(cid:3)hmans] before, so you must now propi-
tiate them, even if they revile or shun you, even repeatedly.
Stanza 148.21 also returns to the immediate context of Janamejaya’s
own sin, with Indrota addressing the fears Janamejaya expressed in
147.5cd-6, in which he worried for the future of his descendants. He
‘should not give consideration’43 to these things, Indrota says, since
there are ways to remedy the situation, remedies that form the topic of
the subsequent verses. As with the earlier passage 146.6-15 discussed
above, the initial ‘remedies’ or expiations of the sequence are closely
tied to the context of the narrative, in this case stanzas 148.22-3ab re-
flect the views and language of 147.15-16: 44

One who repents on account of his evil action is freed from a quarter of
the evil; one who vows not to do it again is freed from a second quarter
of the evil; one who vows, ‘I will exclusively practice dharma’, is freed
from a third quarter of that evil. A man who desires prosperity ought to
commit himself to good conduct.

parently complete the series: (*381) (cid:3)ucis t(cid:5)rth(cid:2)ny anucaraü(cid:3) caturth(cid:2)t parimucyate|
‘a person freed from a fourth part while travelling to holy places is pure’. Without
further explanation, Belvalkar provides his own gloss: “The fourth part, one has of
course to atone for by suffering (bhoga).”
312 CHAPTER SEVEN
As with the earlier passage, after this initial enumeration of closely
contextualised expiations, a further sequence appears to have been
collated, most of which address the same theme: acts which expiate
sins. Also like the earlier sequence, these stanzas seem relatively dis-
connected from one another and read like aphoristic formulas, though
their principal function is to valorise good conduct (e.g., kaly(cid:2)õam in
148.23).
This ‘good conduct’ can take on quite ritualised forms, as 148.24-6
demonstrate. The most problematic term in these stanzas is the poten-
tially ambiguous bhr(cid:6)õahan in 24ef and 25, a term which can mean
both ‘br(cid:3)hman-killer’ and ‘foetus-killer’.46 In his recent translation,
Fitzgerald takes the two instances of bhr(cid:6)õahan in 24ef-25 (which
respectively state that ‘a bhr(cid:6)õahan is freed after worshipping Agni
for three years’ and that ‘a bhr(cid:6)õahan is freed after he has saved as
many lives of the same kind (tajj(cid:2)t(cid:5)y(cid:2)n) as he has taken’) to mean
‘foetus-killer’, though in a footnote he notes that it can also mean
brahminicide and further notes the ambiguity of the term in an end-
note to 148.25.47 In addition it appears that Fitzgerald does not take
148.26 to be contiguous with these two, since he marks it off as be-
ginning a new paragraph. I would argue, however, that whatever the
provenance of these stanzas (and the indications are that they have
been sourced from somewhere), it is their position and combination in
in this text about brahminicide that should govern their meanings for
this text.
We shall first discuss 148.26, a stanza found in almost exactly the
same form in VDhS 26.8:48
api v(cid:2)psu nimajjeta trir japann aghamarùaõam|
yath(cid:2)(cid:3)vamedh(cid:2)vabh(cid:8)thas tath(cid:2) tan manur abrav(cid:5)t||
Or else he could dive into the waters while chanting the ‘sin-effacing’
mantra [RV 10.190] three times. Manu declares this to be as effective
as the bath that ends the horse sacrifice.

ficatory bath that ends a sacrifice) or the a(cid:3)vamedha (the horse sacri-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
46 Of course, etymologically, the sense of the term is ‘foetus-killer’, see M.

fice, which includes an avabh(cid:8)tha) is made in a number of dharma
texts.49 The VDhS version occurs in a list of expiations, some of
which are for particular sins. Since no particular sin is designated for
the penance in this stanza, it is possible that it is meant as a generally
efficacious expiation. It is more likely, however, that it refers to the
sin of gurutalpa ‘having sex with the wife of a teacher’, since the dis-
course marker api v(cid:2) beginning VDhS 26.8 establishes a connection
to VDhS 26.7. In being transposed into the (cid:2)DhP, the stanza might
also be understood as a general expiation, as Fitzgerald appears to take
it. However, if api v(cid:2) is allowed to function as a discourse connector,
148.26 can be understood in connection with 148.24ef-25, and there-
fore as referring to bhr(cid:6)õahan. Perhaps the most telling evidence,
however—indeed the most telling evidence that the sequence in
148.24ef-26 refers to br(cid:3)hman-killing—is that both the bath at the end
of the horse sacrifice and the Aghamarùaõa, the »gvedic hymn
10.190, are regarded in many dharma texts as being capable of purify-
ing a br(cid:3)hman-killer.50
But is this indeed how we should understand bhr(cid:6)õahan in
148.24ef-25? The broader context of the narrative in which stanza
these stanzas are embedded leads to the conclusion that the redactors
intended them to refer to the expiation of the sin of killing a br(cid:3)hman.
It is of this, after all, that Janamejaya is guilty, and it would make
sense for the text to attempt to address it in its list of expiations. If
taken in this way, tajj(cid:2)t(cid:5)y(cid:2)n in 148.25, ‘lives of the same kind’, can
then be understood to refer to br(cid:3)hmans just as easily as ‘foetuses’, as
Fitzgerald takes it, since there is no further specification for the crime
than bhr(cid:6)õahan, and there is clearly (cid:5)(cid:3)stric precedence to regard the
saving of the life of a br(cid:3)hman as an expiation for taking the life of a
br(cid:3)hman.51 It is true, however, that the expiation found in 148.24ef
(worshipping Agni for three years) seems quite light for the sin of kill-

often said to remove ‘all sins’, as in MS 11.259-60 [11.260-61] and GDhS 24.12. In
Harivaü(cid:3)a 22.12, the ‘smell of blood’ (lohagandha) on Janamejaya disappears once
he enters the avabh(cid:8)tha.

ing a br(cid:3)hman. Yet by itself this is not conclusive. The expiations for
killing a br(cid:3)hman are many, and of varying degrees of harshness, as
the list in MS 11.72-89 indicates.52
There is, however, another way to account for these stanzas that po-
tentially refer to ‘foetus-killing’ in a text in which we would expect
stanzas on brahminicide. As might be evident from the above discus-
sion, there is an implicit potential for confusion in the double meaning
of the term bhr(cid:6)õahan.53 In his translation of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, Oliv-
elle has noted that it is often difficult to establish which of the two
senses is intended where there is no other specification on the nature
of the crime.54 Interestingly, VDhS 20.23 gives both senses of bhr(cid:6)õa-
han. According to this definition, a bhr(cid:6)õahan as ‘abortionist’ is
someone who kills a foetus whose gender is unknown, since the baby
might turn out to be a male and, hence, grow up to be a (sacrificing)
br(cid:3)hman.55 (As is typical of the dharmas(cid:6)tras, this rule implicitly ap-
plies to the babies of br(cid:3)hmans.) Furthermore, a bhr(cid:6)õahan in the
sense of abortionist is often given the same or similar penances as a
br(cid:3)hman-killer.56 The ambiguity of the term, therefore, seems to pro-
vide ample grounds for confusion in its usage. If I am correct in think-
ing that the stanzas from 148.22 onwards were compiled from various
sources to revolve around the expiation of sin, and 24ef-26 especially
for br(cid:3)hman-killing, then the potential for confusion in a term like
bhr(cid:6)õahan may have led to the inclusion of 24ef, despite the apparent
levity of its expiation. That is to say, the inclusion and contextualised
meaning of these stanzas seems more readily explained by their the-
matic coincidence with the sin of br(cid:3)hman killing, the original narra-
tive engine of the text; if there is any confusion, this lies in the am-
biguous nature of the term bhr(cid:6)õahan. Further substantiation for this
reading of bhr(cid:6)õahan as ‘brahminicide’ is found in a hemistich ex-
cised from the Critical Edition (*382), but which occurs in an exten-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
52 [11.73-90.] Compare, e.g., MS 11.73cd with 11.76 or 11.77cd.

56 E.g. (cid:2)DhS 1.24.7-22; VDhS 20.25f. (where bhr(cid:6)õahan may refer to both
senses); GDhS 24.6-12, and especially MS 11.87 [11.88].

sive number of (southern and northern) manuscripts preceding stanza
148.25:57
abhyetya yojana(cid:3)ataü bhr(cid:6)õah(cid:2) vipramucyate|
Having walked a hundred yojanas, a slayer of br(cid:3)hmans is freed [from
that sin].
MS 11.75 contains a similar prescription, replacing bhr(cid:6)õah(cid:2) with
brahmahaty(cid:2), confirming that ‘killer of br(cid:3)hmans’ is the proper sense
of bhr(cid:6)õahan in this hemistich.58 At the very least, this suggests that at
some point in the receptive history of this text, this sequence was un-
derstood to pertain to the killing of br(cid:3)hmans. The conclusion must
be, therefore, that while there may be grounds for taking any one of
these stanzas in isolation to refer to something other than br(cid:3)hman
killing, their compilation together in this text seems to feed the pur-
pose of providing a list of expiations for the crime of brahminicide,
the crime governing the text’s narrative.
Leaving aside these stanzas on bhr(cid:6)õahan, the central point is re-
turned to in stanzas 148.28-30, which contain the dialogue between
the ‘suras and asuras’ and the devaguru, B(cid:7)haspati, to which we have
already alluded:59 doing good absolves the accidental doing of evil, a
point which Indrota reiterates in his closing argument. This small dia-
logue also attests to the composite nature of chapter 148. The cumula-
tive effect of this compilation of verses is to produce a small catalogue
speaking to the theme of the expiation of sins. And what might the
point be of this excursus? A king in distress, as we have repeatedly
discovered in the course of the (cid:2)DhP, must necessarily perform acts
that have a problematic moral foundation. Can the negative effects of
the consequences of such conduct be limited? Can a king, despite the
ethical compromises of his position, strive towards some kind of sal-
vation? This text, it seems, provides one kind of answer to this prob-
lem: good conduct cancels the consequences of (accidental) bad con-
duct. It is with this theme of expiation that this text ought to be situ-
ated in the (cid:2)DhP, and it is a theme that is never far from the problems
posed by the notion of (cid:2)paddharma. Indeed, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra had to per-

form tapas to burn his sin of eating dog meat,60 and the (cid:2)DhP, as we
shall shortly discover, has an entire chapter devoted to the topic of
expiation (159, SU 25). Despite the negative consequences a king
might incur due to the acts he undertakes to maintain his rule, there is
always hope that in the terms of his own salvation the equation can be
balanced, as Vy(cid:3)sa too explains to Yudhiùñhira, when instructing him
to perform an a(cid:3)vamedha to absolve his sins from the war.61 This also
establishes an incentive for the king to act with good will, since it is
through this that he earns his own salvation. Unit 15, then, offers an-
other perspective on the problem of kingship. In this case, an ethic of
individualism—derived, in part, from traditions of asceticism (re-
membering the near conflation of tapas and dharma noted ear-
lier)—that places greatest value upon personal salvation, in which the
means (how one acts) leads to certain predictable ends (salvation; or
its opposite), encounters a theory of kingship more generally found in
the (cid:2)DhP—in which the ends (the stability of the kingdom, etc.) jus-
tify the means.
The discussion of this unit will be brought to a close by posing the
question of the identity of Janamejaya, the perpetrator of brahminicide
to whom (cid:6)aunaka addresses himself. The genealogies recounted in the
Mbh’s (cid:2)diparvan know of four Janamejayas, two of which are Jana-
mejaya P(cid:3)rikùits.62 Belvalkar contends that the Janamejaya P(cid:3)rikùit of
this particular text should “be distinguished from the well-known
Janamejaya at whose sarpa-sattra Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana recites the Mah(cid:3)-
bh(cid:3)rata”.63 On the other hand, Fitzgerald suggests it “is more likely
that the story originated apart from the Mbh, the Mbh’s Janamejaya
being intended, and was inserted into these anthologies relatively
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
60 (cid:2)DhP 139.91. It is also curious that, once the MS has recounted the (cid:2)pad-
dharmas, in 10.131 Manu announces the topic of the ‘rules of atonement’ (pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)-
cittavidhi). It seems that there is an architectonic convention of placing a section on
pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta after a discussion of (cid:2)paddharma. See below p.371.

late”.64 F.E. Pargiter,65 in attempting to reconstruct the Paurava lineage
on the basis of genealogy lists in the Mbh and the pur(cid:2)õas, enumer-
ates no less than three Janamejayas,66 two of whom are P(cid:3)rikùits, dis-
tinguishing the Janamejaya of the Mbh’s inner frame story (Janame-
jaya III, son of Parikùit II) from the Janamejaya of the text narrated in
SU 15 (Janamejaya II, son of Parikùit I). The latter Janamejaya he also
equates with the Janamejaya of (cid:6)B 13.5.4.1-3 and, along with his
“sons” (considered his brothers in Mbh 1.3.1),67 with the P(cid:3)rikùitas of
B(cid:2)U 3.3. Others, however, make no distinction between such Jana-
mejayas.68 The genealogy lists of the pur(cid:2)õas and the Mbh are notori-
ously unreliable for firm historical conclusions,69 and, with such
highly conflicting data, the line between reconstruction and imposition
seems very fine indeed. A more reasonable view, in my opinion, is
that we are dealing with, to paraphrase Hiltebeitel,70 various idealisa-
tions of an important king of a distant past, and that this tale is, per-
haps, drawn from a ‘cycle’ of Janamejaya or P(cid:3)rikùit stories.
Yet, the narration of this Janamejaya tale requires some explana-
tion, since, as Fitzgerald notes, neither Janamejaya nor Parikùit had
been born at this stage of the Mbh narrative.71 Furthermore, if we con-
sider that the Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira frame is embedded in the Mbh’s
inner frame of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana and Janamejaya, then this tale involves
a potentially curious, indeed anomalous, self-reflexivity, since Jana-

takenly designated his sons (cid:6)rutasena, Ugrasena and Bh(cid:8)masena as his brothers (the
latter two of which are also listed as among the brothers of a Janamejaya P(cid:3)rikùit—
presumably Pargiter’s Janamejaya II son of Parikùit I—at Mbh 1.89.48).

close, Parikùit will be still-born and then revived by K(cid:7)ùõa (Mbh 14.65.8-9 and 68.23-

mejaya may effectively be hearing a story about himself and
Yudhiùñhira may be hearing about his yet to be born great grand-
nephew!72 This arresting narrative recursiveness is compounded by
Janamejaya’s co-interlocutor sharing a patronymic ((cid:6)aunaka) with one
of the interlocutor’s in the Mbh’s outer frame who is hearing an Mbh
from the s(cid:6)ta Ugra(cid:5)ravas. The latter (cid:6)aunaka is nowhere called In-
drota, suggesting that the two should not, strictly speaking, be identi-
fied as the one person. But we should be wary of concluding that the
choice of interlocutors is an unknowing coincidence, and we could
perhaps regard the authors or redactors as engaging in a bit of playful-
ness by vaguely suggesting, or leaving it open for the audience to con-
clude, that the principal audiences of the two tellings of the Mbh de-
scribed in the Mbh itself are here engaging in a conversation of their
own. A recursive or reflex playfulness with participants in Mbh narra-
tives is not uncommon—we need only to think of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana recit-
ing ‘Vy(cid:3)sa’s thought entire’ (i.e. the Mbh) while Vy(cid:3)sa appears at
regular intervals throughout the narrative73—and reminds us that all
such narrative devices are as fictional as the narratives themselves.
However, if the two Janamejayas are the same individual, how should
we view such a temporal narrative inconsistency? Presumably, Bel-
valkar concluded that this Janamejaya should be distinguished from
the Janamejaya of the Mbh’s inner frame because he presupposed that
the redactors of the Mbh would have been concerned to maintain tem-
poral narrative consistency between its different generic elements.74
Fitzgerald’s view suggests a similar presupposition, or, at least, that a
‘later’ redactor was less concerned with such temporal consistency
than an earlier redactor. But is this justified? Or, just as the didactic
books herald a hiatus in the narrative action and the delaying of
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s death, is time too suspended for the duration of the didac-
tus? To put it another way, were there different generic determinants
holding sway in these didactic texts, determinants which did not de-
mand temporal narrative consistency in the way we are accustomed to
thinking?
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
72 This is even more pronounced in Harivaü(cid:3)a 22.7, where Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana intro-
duces the Janamejaya of the tale as someone who shares the same name as the
Janamejaya he addresses (… tava san(cid:2)m(cid:2) vai pauravo janamejaya).
73 See Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, pp.32-91, 278-322.

DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 319
7.3 ‘The dialogue between the vulture and the jackal’
(Mbh 12.149; SU 16)
An initial encounter with SU 16 of the (cid:2)DhP proves perplexing inas-
much as it appears at first sight to have little thematic intersection in
relation to the major themes thus far encountered, nor does it seem to
tie in with problems raised in its immediate vicinity. Similarly, the
frame to this tale is especially loose. In the Critical Edition it is intro-
duced quite abruptly, with no pra(cid:3)na from Yudhiùñhira. In addition,
Bh(cid:8)ùma provides only the briefest statement of intent (SI) in 149.1
before launching into the ‘dialogue’ that consumes the body of the
text. This text is, therefore, rhetorically less well grounded in the
(cid:2)DhP than we might have come to expect. Indeed, some manuscripts
show that attempts were made to address this problem by inserting a
question from Yudhiùñhira, which attests to the generic importance of
the pra(cid:3)na for the organisation of texts like the (cid:2)DhP.75 As Belvalkar
has pointed out, however, these pra(cid:3)nas do not add much explanatory
power or motivation to the text at hand.76 Yet despite this lack of con-
textualisation, this text raises a problem of (cid:2)pad that, while quite new
for the (cid:2)DhP, resonates in significant ways for the Mbh as a whole. In
the following, the views of some indigenous exegetes—namely, N(cid:8)la-
kaõñha, (cid:2)nandavardhana and Abhinavagupta—shall first be canvassed
to see how they interpret the function of this text, and then in the clos-
ing comments some important thematic linkages between the (cid:2)DhP,
the concept of (cid:2)paddharma and the entire Mbh shall also be ad-
dressed.
The unfolding of the narrative of this ‘old history’ (itih(cid:2)saü
pur(cid:2)tanam) revolves around a distinction in the habits of the vulture
and jackal, both of whom are carrion eating scavengers waiting to feed
upon a boy’s corpse. The vulture is active during the day and therefore
wants the boy’s relatives to leave as soon as possible; the jackal is ac-

dead man be returned to life again?’ (kaccin martyo m(cid:8)to r(cid:2)jan punar ujj(cid:5)vito bhavet).
The second, found in only two manuscripts, K3 and K9, speaks of the efforts ((cid:2)ghañ;

tive at night and therefore wants the relatives to stay until the sun goes
down, leaving the corpse for him alone.77
The following is a brief summary:
A family holds their recently deceased son and wails by the side of his
grave. A vulture appears and tells them that death is the normal way of
things and therefore, since the sun has set, they should go home. As the
boy’s relatives prepare to leave, a jackal approaches and encourages
them to wait. He points out that the sun has yet to set and the boy could
still be returned to life; they should stay and grieve. The relatives turn
back to the body. However the vulture again speaks, disabusing them of
the jackal’s speech. The boy is lifeless, the vulture maintains, and they
should go home, for grieving is pointless. The jackal criticises the vul-
ture for deceptiveness, and again encourages them to grieve until the
sun sets, suggesting that their son would then return to life. The two
continue to argue while the relatives weep. The vulture, appalled at
their stubbornness, insists that they should go and devote themselves to
useful things, like dharma. The relatives once again prepare to leave.
The jackal despairs at the harshness of a world in which a much loved
dead person can be abandoned so easily when it suits the interests of
mourners. The jackal, deceptively eulogising love but with his own in-
terests in mind, leads the relatives back to the centre of the cemetery.
The vulture again appeals to them, pointing to the horridness of the
graveyard that becomes so dangerous after sunset. They should there-
fore depart immediately or they might also die. The jackal tells them
not to worry, because the sun still shines. They should stay if they want
their son returned to life. The two scavengers continue to argue, the vul-
ture insisting they leave before sunset and the jackal after sunset. The
relatives of the boy are completely confused. But (cid:6)iva, who stands
nearby, offers them a boon. They ask that their son be returned to life.
He obliges and also removes the hunger of the jackal and vulture. They
all rejoice and depart.
For the (cid:2)DhP this tale represents quite a new take on the theme of
(cid:2)pad. It does not deal with exceptional circumstances involving either
immediate threats to livelihoods or the various scenarios of political
expediency that have thus far been typical of the texts of the (cid:2)DhP.
The tragi-comicality of this tale—with the misery of the dead boy’s
relatives serving as counterpoint to the amusing interplay of the two
hungry scavengers—provides a moment of welcome comic relief in
the (cid:2)DhP.78 Yet despite its comedic ‘gallows’ humour, this fable the-

DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 321
matically intersects with the notion of (cid:2)paddharma through the trag-
edy associated with the loss of a son, a tragedy compounded by the
great weight br(cid:3)hmaõic and Hindu theology gave to a ‘son’ as a ‘life-
giver’. This is given particular focus in 149.108, when the boy’s rela-
tives address (cid:6)iva:
ekaputravih(cid:5)n(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü sarveù(cid:2)ü j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rthin(cid:2)m|
putrasya no j(cid:5)vad(cid:2)n(cid:2)j j(cid:5)vitaü d(cid:2)tum arhasi||
We, who want life, are all bereft of our only son; please give life to us
by giving life to our son!
The equation here between the ‘son’ and the ‘life’ of his parents and
relatives is no accident of expression. A son not only provides for his
parents (and, here, his relatives) in a material, economic sense, but is
also responsible for a group of interconnected ritual and social duties
and beliefs: a son continues the lineage, a father is ‘reborn’ as his son,
a son represents the fulfilment of one of his father’s ‘three debts’, and
a ‘son’ performs the (cid:3)r(cid:2)ddha rites to his ancestors.79 It is for such rea-
sons that childlessness is considered a paradigmatic situation of (cid:2)pad-
dharma, a crisis the institution of niyoga is designed to address.80
Indigenous interpreters have other perspectives to offer. N(cid:8)la-
kaõñha, the seventeenth century commentator on the Mbh, begins his
commentary on this chapter in the following way:
tad evaü vy(cid:2)pannasya raj(cid:9)o buddhip(cid:6)rvam abuddhip(cid:6)rvaü v(cid:2) k(cid:8)taü
p(cid:2)paü satkarmaõ(cid:2) dharm(cid:2)dhyavas(cid:2)yena ca na(cid:3)yat(cid:5)ti paralokabhay(cid:2)

avasthitasya k(cid:2)cid gatir asti na veti p(cid:8)cchati kaccid iti|
So, in this way, evil, whether premeditated or not, brought about by a
king who has fallen into distress, is removed through good action and
through effort in respect to dharma. Thus fear for the next world is the
meaning demonstrated. In this world, for one who has fallen ill, appar-
ently dead, who has been given attention in order to be eaten by one of
those two [the vulture and jackal] through the assertion of their respec-
tive claims, and who remained in that condition for some time for what-
ever reason, there [seems] to be no way forward at all, thus he [Yudhi-
ùñhira] asks, ‘how, etc’.81

322 CHAPTER SEVEN
By beginning with the morals contained in the two previous texts,
N(cid:8)lakaõñha seems to see this text as being in thematic continuity with
them, a view which would be in keeping with his general tendency to
see contiguity between sequential texts in the (cid:2)DhP. While in the pre-
vious two texts, N(cid:8)lakaõñha sees the protagonist as properly taking
care of his fate in the next world by absolving whatever sins he has

so only god furthers it.
N(cid:8)lakaõñha’s commentary on the stanza introducing the fable is clearly
attentive to the bhakti sentiment underlying the narrative. Other in-
digenous approaches, while distinct from N(cid:8)lakaõñha’s, are similarly
concerned to highlight the underlying bhakti sentiment present here.
The ninth century literary critic (cid:2)nandavardhana in his Dhvany(cid:2)loka,
and especially the tenth century’s Abhinavagupta in his commentary
on that text, the Locana, both give devotion a prominent place in their
interpretations of this text.82
This is not the place for a comprehensive discussion of dhvani,
‘suggestion’, the principal theoretical contribution of the great work
Dhvany(cid:2)loka. Briefly put, (cid:2)nandavardhana developed the theory of
suggestion (dhvani) in order to supply the necessary means for the
aesthetic experience (rasa) to be conveyed by the denotative elements
of a poem. In one taxonomy of dhvani, and the most important for us

82 In this discussion I follow G.A. Tubb, “(cid:7)(cid:2)ntarasa in the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,” in A.
Sharma (ed.), Essays on the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, Leiden: Brill, 1991, pp.171-203, though I
part from him in some instances. I generally follow the translation of the Dhvany(cid:2)loka
in D.H.H. Ingalls, J.M. Masson and M.V. Patwardhan, The Dhvany(cid:3)loka of (cid:4)nanda-
vardhana with the Locana of Abhinavagupta, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University
Press, 1990. I am also indebted to Ingalls’ introduction to that work. I have referred to
the text contained in K. Krishnamoorthy, The Dhvany(cid:2)loka of (cid:4)nandavardhana, ed.
and tr., Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982 (this does not contain Abhinava’s Locana).
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 323
here,83 dhvani is divided between two basic types, (i) avivakùitav(cid:2)cya
‘where the literal sense is unintended’, and (ii) vivakùit(cid:2)nyaparav(cid:2)cya,
‘where the literal sense intended leads on to some further meaning’.84
It is the latter which is most important for the peculiar aesthetic char-
acter of poetry. This is further divided into two subtypes, where, be-
tween the literal sense and the something further, there is (a) no lag in
time (asamlakùyakrama), and (b) there is a lag in time (saülakùya-
krama). The former case is the most important for the connection be-
tween dhvani and rasa: the rasa is evoked by the suggestion of the
sth(cid:2)yibh(cid:2)va,85 the ‘stable emotion’, which corresponds to it, through
the presentation of the denotative elements in the poem which express
the stable emotions. These denotative elements are known as vyabhi-
c(cid:2)rabh(cid:2)va, ‘the temporary feelings that accompany a basic emotion’,
vibh(cid:2)va, ‘the object towards which the emotion is felt and the things
that serve to provoke or stimulate it’, and anubh(cid:2)va ‘the effects of the
stable emotion on the person who experiences it’.86
It is, however, in the second of the subtypes of dhvani that interest
lies for the present unit of the (cid:2)DhP. For in his discussion of the
dhvani where ‘the literal sense leads on to some other meaning’ in
which ‘there is an interval’ (saülakùyakrama) between the ap-
prehension of this ‘other meaning’ and the basic digestion of the facts
in an ‘extended passage’ (prabandha), (cid:2)nandavardhana employs as
one of his demonstrative examples the ‘dialogue between the vulture
and the jackal in the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata’.87 This type of dhvani is also called
anuraõana, ‘reverberation’, since, Abhinava explains, it is like the
resonance produced after the sound of the striking of a bell.88 While
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
83 There is another division of dhvani into vastudhvani (suggestion of fact), alaü-
k(cid:2)radhvani (suggestion of a figure of speech) and rasadhvani (suggestion of a rasa).
See Dhv 1.4.
84 See Ingalls, et al., pp.14-15, 173f. (Dhv 1.13).
85 There was, apparently, much confusion between rasa and sth(cid:2)yibh(cid:2)va. See In-
galls et al., pp.16ff.; Tubb, “(cid:7)(cid:2)ntarasa,” p.193.
86 These definitions are Tubb’s, “(cid:7)(cid:2)ntarasa,” p.187. Cf. Ingalls et al., p.19: “By
suggestion the rasa arises without any conscious realization that our experience has
been preceded by a perception of the determinants [vibh(cid:2)vas], consequents [anub-
h(cid:2)vas] and transitory states of mind [vyabhic(cid:2)ribh(cid:2)vas].”

reducing anuraõana to one of its subtypes, artha(cid:3)aktim(cid:6)la, that which is ‘based on the
power of meaning’. In fact anuraõana (which is called anusv(cid:2)na in the K(cid:3)rik(cid:3)s) in-
cludes also (cid:3)abda(cid:3)aktim(cid:6)la, as 2.20 and 3.15 make clear, and hence is a synonym for
(cid:3)
324 CHAPTER SEVEN
(cid:2)nandavardhana takes this discussion no further, Abhinavagupta con-
tinues his analysis of this text in a curious way. He clearly considers
that the ‘reverberation’ form of dhvani evokes rasa, which appears not
to be the case for (cid:2)nandavardhana.89 It is here that Abhinavagupta’s
reading of the current text becomes especially interesting for us. In his
explanation of this citation, he first gives a basic rendering of the utili-
tarian intentions of the two animals, citing as exemplars (cid:2)DhP 149.8-
9 for the vulture and 148.15 and 60 for the jackal. Abhinava then
closes his discussion by saying ‘the suggested intentions [of the vul-
ture and jackal] bring us to the highest point of (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa’.90 The stark
representation of the self-interested behaviour of the two carrion-
eaters engenders a feeling of disgust (nirveda) in the world, a feeling
which is the basis of (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa.91 The intentions of the carrion-eaters
to eat the dead boy are suggested by their repeated demands on the
boy’s relatives. This is an example of vastudhvani. For Abhinava, vas-
tudhvani can lead on to rasadhvani,92 and in this case he considers that
the vastudhvani evoked by the two animals leads to the suggestion of
(cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa. Intriguingly, as Tubb points out, this is the same principal
rasa that both (cid:2)nandavardhana and Abhinavagupta see as operating in
the entire Mbh.93
Once again, I only intend to briefly review the argument for this
position presented in the Dhvany(cid:2)loka and the Locana in regard to the
Mbh, and the reader is referred to more extensive treatments by other,
more qualified, authors.94 Early on in his work, (cid:2)nandavardhana sig-
nals that the Mbh and the R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa are the great exemplars of his
theory of dhvani;95 and they are also cited as the examples for a
‘whole work’ (prabandha) in which no interval is perceived between
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
saülakùyakramadhvani. Thus this fable is demonstrative of anuraõana (= saülakùya-
kramadhvani), not just one of its subtypes, as Tubb implies.
89 Tubb misses this distinction. See also Ingalls et al., notes to the Locana on
p.450, where Abhinavagupta’s misreading of (cid:2)nandavardhana is discussed; cf. also
p.19 for the general distinction between the two in respect to rasadhvani.

the literal meaning and suggested meaning (alakùyakrama).96 There is,
however, one particular occasion in which the Mbh figures promi-
nently in the Dhvany(cid:2)loka as the text used to demonstrate that a poet
should concentrate on one type of rasa in his composition, since ‘one
predominant rasa distributed throughout the work gives it a special
meaning and an abundance of beauty’.97 As Tubb would have it, it is
quite reasonable to understand this to presuppose that by the consis-
tent evocation of one predominant rasa in the Mbh the poet gives this
enormous work some sense of unity.98 The predominant rasa that is
the focus of the Mbh, (cid:2)nandavardhana argues, and as Abhinava has
suggested for the g(cid:8)dhragom(cid:2)yusaüv(cid:2)da, is the rasa of tranquility,

Again, in the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata, which has the form of a didactic work al-
though it contains poetic beauty, the great sage who was its author, by
his furnishing a conclusion that dismays our hearts by the miserable end
of the V(cid:7)ùõis and P(cid:3)õóavas, shows that the primary aim of his work has
been to produce a disenchantment with the world and that he has in-
tended his primary subject to be liberation from worldly life and the
rasa of peace [tranquility].100
(As corroboration for this position he cites stanza Mbh 12.168.4 to the
effect that disenchantment (vir(cid:2)ga) leads naturally from the ‘insub-
stantiality’ (as(cid:2)ravat) of the way of the world.) All other goals and
rasas are subordinated to these two: the rasa of peace and the goal of
mokùa. In anticipating the objection that neither of these subjects are
found in the Anukramaõ(cid:5) of the (cid:4)diparvan, which is meant to give a

précis of the entire contents of the Mbh, (cid:2)nandavardhana argues that
they are shown through ‘suggestion’, citing Mbh 1.1.193ab which glo-
rifies the ‘eternal V(cid:3)sudeva’. The point, to paraphrase (cid:2)nanda-
vardhana’s v(cid:8)tti on Dhv 4.5, is that while the plight of the P(cid:3)õóavas
and other heroes and villains in the Mbh leads to an ‘unpleasant end’
(avas(cid:2)navirasa) which ‘represents the elaboration of spiritual igno-
rance’ (avidy(cid:2)prapa(cid:9)car(cid:6)pa), the lord V(cid:3)sudeva (by which is meant
the highest brahman) stands in complete contrast as the eternal, ulti-
mate truth. It is he, in fact, who is the object of glorification in the
Mbh, and the exploits of the P(cid:3)õóavas serve to provide a backdrop to
this message, and heighten its potency. In (cid:5)(cid:3)stric terms, the principal
purpose of the Mbh is to inculcate mokùa as the primary ‘goal of man’
(puruù(cid:2)rtha), infused here with the ethos of a ved(cid:3)ntic bhakti; while in
terms of k(cid:2)vya, poetry, it aims to evoke the rasa of peace, the aes-
thetic parallel of mokùa. The lord V(cid:3)sudeva as the absolute brahman is
the ‘something further’ that one should be looking for in a sensitive
dhvani oriented reading of the rasa of the Mbh.101
Tubb has identified an interesting problem in (cid:2)nandavardhana’s
discussion of (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa, in as much as it is difficult to identify the lo-
cus ((cid:2)(cid:3)raya) of the ‘stable emotion’ (sth(cid:2)yibh(cid:2)va) to which this rasa
corresponds.102 To get around this problem, he suggests that (cid:2)nanda-
vardhana intended to take the anuraõana form of dhvani, that is to
say, the saülakùyakramadhvani, ‘where there is a lapse between in-
tended and suggested meaning’, as providing the basis for the evoca-
tion of the (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa in the Mbh.103 It is clear, however, that the
Dhvany(cid:2)loka takes the Mbh to be an example of the operation of the
asaülakùyakrama variety of dhvani working across an entire work
(prabandha).104 Moreover, as already noted, (cid:2)nandavardhana does not
appear to consider that the reverberation (anuraõana, i.e., saülakùya-
kramadhvani) type of dhvani leads to rasa; this, rather, is the position
of Abhinavagupta in his Locana. Tubb may well, however, have iden-
tified a lacuna in (cid:2)nandavardhana’s theorising, which on the one hand
appears to insist upon a locus for the sth(cid:2)yibh(cid:2)va, and then fails to
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

concern us here.

DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 327
clearly identify this (cid:2)(cid:3)raya for the sth(cid:2)yibh(cid:2)va that corresponds to
(cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa (usually said to be t(cid:8)ùõ(cid:2)kùayasukha).
Leaving aside these theoretical problems, there is a remarkable
structural similarity in the evocation of (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa in both the g(cid:8)dhra-
gom(cid:2)yusaüv(cid:2)da (as at least Abhinavagupta maintains) and the entire
Mbh (as both Abhinavagupta and (cid:2)nandavardhana maintain), even if
in each instance this rasa appears to be evoked through the means of
different forms of dhvani. In each case, the mundane concerns and
tribulations of typically very human characters105 are set against the
broader canvas of the permanence of god; it is the efficaciousness of
devotion to god which each exegete understands to be highlighted
against the background of contingent, wordly needs. This structural
similarity provides an interesting avenue in which to imagine how
such a seemingly non-contextualised element of the Mbh may be re-
garded as at one with the whole epic; despite sharing none of the es-
sential narrative elements (strictly understood), by portraying the same
pathos, and by evoking the same path to freedom in the arms of god,
our minor fable might be seen to reflect the same aesthetic, and teach
the same goal, as the entire Mbh.
Just as for (cid:2)nandavardhana and Abhinavagupta it is the jux-
taposition of the permanence of god with the mundane temporality of
the plight of the P(cid:3)õóavas which forms the basis of the (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa
reading of the Mbh, so in both N(cid:8)lakaõñha’s and Abhinavagupta’s exe-
geses of this fable, the key lies in a juxtaposition of elements. For Ab-
hinavagupta, it is this text’s internal juxtaposition of elements which
explains its evocation of (cid:3)(cid:2)ntarasa; while for N(cid:8)lakaõñha, it is the jux-
taposition of this text against other texts in its immediate vicinity that
especially lends force to its representation of the power of the deity. In
this way, both interpreters find semantic justifications for this text’s
location. While one grounds it in its immediate context and the other
accounts for its contextual relevance within the Mbh, both see its prin-
cipal meaning to be found in bhakti themes. We can see this last as-
pect clearly underlined by Bh(cid:8)ùma in his closing statements to this
text, as part of its relatively minimal frame (149.112-14):
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
105 I say this with full awareness of the partly divine genesis of the Mbh heroes and
the animality of the principal characters in the fable; the underlying humanness por-
trayed in each hardly needs discussion here.

Without despondency and with long and firm resolve, and due to the
grace of the god of gods, a person quickly attains results. For see how
their absorption in god and their resolve enabled those weeping and
grieving relatives to wipe away their tears. And see how, after a little
time and due to seeking for certainty, having attained grace from (cid:6)aü-
kara those sad sacks gained happiness.
If the mundaneness and temporality of the central narrative of the
Mbh provides a backdrop for the demonstration of god’s munificence
and permanence, can the same be said for the position of this text
within the (cid:2)DhP? This text, displaying the omnipotence of god in the
face of apparent hopelessness, is clearly juxtaposed to the mundane,
politically opportunistic, and contingent concerns of so many of the
texts in the (cid:2)DhP that precede it. It is as if to say, if all else fails, there
is always hope that divine generosity will respond to faith.
Though none of these indigenous exegetes push their interpreta-
tions of this text in this direction, it is tempting to draw on their evoca-
tions of a compassionate interventionist god in light of two much
broader (and often related) themes in the Mbh, one of which was
briefly discussed at the beginning of this section.106 Both themes are,
indeed, important framing motifs of the entire Mbh narrative, motifs
that draw the notion of a ‘time of crisis’ and its consequent expedien-
cies directly into the reckoning. The first of these is the motif of divine
intervention in the affairs of the earth. This motif is most obviously
recognisable in the avat(cid:2)ra theory, which, despite apparently being
under development in the Mbh, is evident in a nascent form in the
story of the ‘descent’ (ava+t®) of the gods from the heavens to earth—
led by N(cid:3)r(cid:3)yaõa-Viùõu incarnating as K(cid:7)ùõa, the avat(cid:2)ra writ large—
partially incarnating portions of themselves in the Mbh’s heroes in
order to save the earth from being overrun by demons (who incarnate
on earth as the Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras).107 It is in part through this story that the

DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 329
Mbh projects itself into a ‘time of crisis’ of cosmic dimensions.108 The
second motif, as briefly discussed earlier, is the notion that childless-
ness is a ‘time of crisis’ that threatens both the survival of a dynasty
and the performance of the rites that sustain the ancestors in heaven.
Indeed, this crisis emerges as one of the most significant motifs that
frame the unfolding crisis in the Mbh, since for two generations—that
of the P(cid:3)õóava heroes themselves and the generation of their father,
P(cid:3)õóu—the (cid:2)paddharma of niyoga (levirate) was required to rescue
the Kuru line from the dynastic crisis of barrenness.109 These twin
themes—a divine intervention rescuing the earth from a crisis of po-
tentially devastating proportions and a crisis entailing dynastic col-
lapse—come together in the saving of the P(cid:3)õóava-Kuru lineage
through the intervention of K(cid:7)ùõa in the reviving of Parikùit, Arjuna’s
grandson and Janamejaya’s father, who becomes at the moment of his
revival the last hope of the next Bh(cid:3)rata-Kuru-P(cid:3)õóava generation as
its future potentate.110 The incorporation of this blackly humorous tale
in the (cid:2)DhP therefore fills out an important lacuna in all of its preced-
ing discussions of (cid:2)paddharma. Indeed the crisis it canvasses draws it
into line with both the ‘laws for crises’ that engender the entire Mbh
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
Mbh 1.57.75-105 and 1.61. For different views on the avat(cid:2)ra theory in the epics, see
Brockington, The Sanskrit Epics, pp.277ff. and Goldman, “Gods in Hiding”.
108 Another way in which it does this is in the context of the four yugas, with the
events of the Mbh falling between the third and fourth yugas (Treta- and Kali-yugas).
See Biardeau, Études—bhakti et avat(cid:2)ra, pp.26-42, on the awkward fit between the
yuga-theory and the avat(cid:2)ra theory.
109 In the first instance, K(cid:7)ùõa Dvaip(cid:3)yana Vy(cid:3)sa is appointed to engender heirs for
the dead king Vicitrav(cid:8)rya (Bh(cid:8)ùma’s younger brother; Bh(cid:8)ùma had earlier renounced
his right to the throne and also refused to act as substitute for his brother) on his
wives, resulting in the births of Dh(cid:7)tar(cid:3)ùñra (father of the Kauravas), P(cid:3)õóu (father of
the P(cid:3)õóavas) and Vidura (see Mbh 1.97-99; above pp.1f.). (Vy(cid:3)sa, therefore, is not
merely the reputed ‘author’ of the Mbh, but is also responsible for engendering its
principal heroes and villains.) Subsequently, P(cid:3)õóu, cursed into celibacy on pain of
death, persuades his wife Kunt(cid:8) to employ the same dharmic mechanism to produce
sons for him so that he could gain heaven. Kunt(cid:8) agrees and, using a magic formula
(mantra) granted to her by a sage ‘with a view to (cid:2)paddharma’ ((cid:2)paddharm(cid:2)nvave-
kùay(cid:2)—Mbh 1.104.6; i.e., the very situation she subsequently finds herself in) she had
served many years before, summons the gods Dharma, V(cid:3)yu and Indra to father sons
on her (respectively Yudhiùñhira, Bh(cid:8)ma and Arjuna; she then gives the formula to
P(cid:3)õóu’s second wife M(cid:3)dr(cid:8), who summons the twin A(cid:5)vins and consequently gives
birth to the twins Nakula and Sahadeva (see Mbh 1.104 and 111-13). In both cases the
arguments for and against are framed through discourses of dharma, (cid:2)paddharma and
niyoga. Significantly, as in the present context, in Mbh 1.97-99 Bh(cid:8)ùma shows himself
to be an expert on the relationship between dharma and (cid:2)paddharma.

cast and, consequently, the story in which they participate (in which
(cid:2)paddharmas are also frequently on the ascendancy), and also the cri-
sis of the near collapse of the lineage that draws the events of the war
to a close and which is only rescued through the divine intervention of
the ‘god on earth’ K(cid:7)ùõa.
7.4 ‘The dialogue between the wind and the (cid:7)almali tree’
(Mbh 12.150-151; SU 16)
Like the previous unit, this text has no pra(cid:3)na.111 In its absence
Bh(cid:8)ùma starts the tale comprising this unit quite abruptly in the first
stanza, introducing it with the standard atr(cid:2)py ud(cid:2)harant(cid:5)mam itih(cid:2)-
saü pur(cid:2)tanam, ‘on this matter they also relate this ancient tale’,
summarised below:
In the Him(cid:3)layas there was a great (cid:6)almali tree. Its trunk was huge and
it had a broad canopy full of singing birds. It was indeed the finest of
trees, and beneath it all manner of animals and travellers took refuge
from the heat. One day, the sage N(cid:3)rada approached the tree and
praised it. How was it, he mused, that the wind, which caused havoc
everywhere it went, had left the great tree unscathed. Was it because the
wind was the tree’s friend and protector, or because the tree had abased
himself before the wind?
The (cid:6)almali tree bragged that it was not the wind’s friendship that
had allowed him to survive, but his own great strength. Though the
wind could destroy everything else in its path, it was broken by the tree!
N(cid:3)rada scolded the tree for such arrogance, and insisted there was
nothing stronger than the wind. The wind animated all life; but so could
it cause destruction. Furious with the tree’s stupidity, N(cid:3)rada went to
the wind and told him everything the (cid:6)almali tree had said. The wind
angrily approached the tree and abused him for his conceit. It was not
the tree’s strength that left him standing, but the fact that the lord grand-
father (Brahm(cid:3)) had taken rest in that tree during the creation of living
things and therefore protected it out of gratitude. Now that the tree had
treated the wind contemptuously, the wind would show his true
strength.
The (cid:6)almali tree suddenly realised his folly, that indeed the wind had
no equal in strength, and resolved to use his keen intelligence, which
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
111 Very much the same northern manuscripts as was the case with unit 16 (K3-5
V1 B Da Dn1.n3 D2-5.8) insert a pra(cid:3)na at the beginning of (cid:2)DhP 150. This pra(cid:3)na
is closely tied to the context of the fable. There is some formal resemblance between
this pra(cid:3)na and those that opened 12.128-9.
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 331
had no equal among the trees, to free himself from this danger. Under-
standing he was no match for the wind’s strength, the tree shook off all
his leaves and hewed off all his branches, and waited for the arrival of
the wind at dawn.
When the angry, howling wind arrived and saw the (cid:6)almali tree
standing without limbs and flowers, he smilingly told the tree that it
was as if he had torn off the branches himself, such was the effect of his
anger. Stripped by his own poor deliberations, the tree was subjugated
to the wind’s power. The tree was deeply ashamed and tormented at the
memory of what N(cid:3)rada had said to him.
A significant factor that separates this from the three prior units is its
more clearly defined political character, which announces a return to
some thematic elements already encountered in earlier texts in the
(cid:2)DhP. To some extent this is reflected at the level of language. While
on a superficial level there is an absence of lexical items we might ex-
pect to find in a text that would deal with (cid:2)paddharma, notable espe-
cially in respect to (cid:2)pad, vyasana and so on, the fable does pivot on
issues that drive politically oriented discussions of the problem of
(cid:2)pad. The crucial issue for this text is ‘power’ (bala), those who do
not have it (durbala), and those that do (balavat, balavattara, bal(cid:5)yas),
and how the former should properly relate to the latter. Bh(cid:8)ùma under-
scores these issues in his concluding statement (151.27):
tasm(cid:2)d vairaü na kurv(cid:5)ta durbalo balavattaraiþ|
(cid:3)oced dhi vairaü kurv(cid:2)õo yath(cid:2) vai (cid:3)almalis tath(cid:2)||
Therefore, a weak man should not engage in hostilities with stronger
people, for acting with hostility he shall be sorry, just like the (cid:6)almali
tree.
The language in this stanza places this text within the context of other
texts of the (cid:2)DhP, and, indeed, further afield in the RDhP. The rela-
tionship of the weak (durbala) with the stronger (balavattara) is often
the touchstone which orients political discussion. We have seen that
this is the case in the KA, and it underlies the conception of anarchy
that we find in many Indian texts.112 It is an issue we find repeatedly
addressed in the (cid:2)DhP, especially forming the basis for much of the
discussion in SUs 1 (RDhP 128), 2, 9 and 10 ((cid:2)DhP 129, 136 and
137).113 Similarly, the related problem of ‘hostility’ or ‘feuding’

113 Note, for example, the language of stanzas 128.3, 129.3, 136.6, 160, 175, 192.
For (cid:2)DhP 136, see also above p.254.
332 CHAPTER SEVEN
(vaira) is also often discussed within the context of the use and abuse
of power.114 While this unit’s concerns intersect with much of what we
have read in other units of the (cid:2)DhP, units which have a tendency to
relate what ought be done, this particular unit distinguishes itself from
those units by relating what ought not be done, and in this sense it
should be considered a cautionary tale.
It is in the light of these realpolitisch concerns that we ought to
read this text. The (cid:6)almali tree was at fault in two significant ways.
His first failing was to have the conceit of being more powerful than
he really was, and consequently reaching beyond his capacity. In po-
litical terms, this is a fundamental failing.115 But his problems were
compounded by a second failing (151.29-30):
vairaü na kurv(cid:5)ta naro durbuddhir buddhij(cid:5)vin(cid:2)|
buddhir buddhimato y(cid:2)ti t(cid:6)leùv iva hut(cid:2)(cid:3)anaþ||
na hi buddhy(cid:2) samaü kiü cid vidyate puruùe n(cid:8)pa|
tath(cid:2) balena r(cid:2)jendra na samo ’st(cid:5)ti cintayet||
A man of weak intellect should not engage in hostility with someone
who lives by his intellect; the intelligence of an intelligent man moves
like fire among grass. Prince, in a man nothing equals intelligence; just
so, lord of kings, one should make another think, ‘nothing equals
power’.
The (cid:6)almali tree therefore possessed a second conceit, to believe that
his intelligence was greater than it really was, a conceit leading him to
reach beyond the capacity of his intellect. Not only was the wind
stronger than the (cid:6)almali tree, it was also smarter. This is an important
point, since the intellect is so often conceived as a buttress against
power.116 This, I think, is the point of the last two padas (151.30cd). A
man who uses his intellect can outmanoeuvre a stronger man, forcing
him to extend beyond his capacities. Indeed, the importance of in-
telligence is underlined by the fact that the wind defeats the (cid:6)almali
tree by his intellect, not by his power, even though he could well have;
the wind has indeed made the (cid:6)almali tree think that ‘there is nothing
equal to power’. The (cid:6)almali tree, therefore, suffered from two crucial
conceits, the fantasy that he had more power than he really had, and
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
114 See above p.259.
115 Overreaching or outsmarting (ati+sam+(cid:2)dh(cid:2)) an enemy (and not to overreach
oneself) is a constant refrain in the KA. See e.g. KA 7.8-11. While cognates of this
construction are not found here, this fable clearly demonstrates the same problem.
116 See discussions of (cid:2)DhP 135-6 above pp.243ff. and 249ff.
DIVERSIONS ON A THEME 333
the delusion that he was smarter than he really was; and it is the two
together that truly cripples him, since a man without power can at
least rely on his intellect, and a man without an intellect can at least
resort to his power.
The closing stanza makes clear that we have now come to some kind
of an ending, though roughly a third of the (cid:2)DhP remains. The text
acknowledges this fact quite explicitly, when Bh(cid:8)ùma says in the final
stanza of unit 17 (151.34):
ukt(cid:2)s te r(cid:2)jadharm(cid:2)(cid:3) ca (cid:2)paddharm(cid:2)(cid:3) ca bh(cid:2)rata|
vistareõa mah(cid:2)r(cid:2)ja kiü bh(cid:6)yaþ prabrav(cid:5)mi te||
The r(cid:2)jadharmas and (cid:2)paddharmas have been related to you at length,
Bh(cid:3)rata. Great king, what more can I tell you?
Notable in this statement is the thematic contiguity it establishes be-
tween the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP, and the plural nature of the terms raja-
dharma and (cid:2)paddharma, reminiscent of a point Fitzgerald makes in
regard to the MDhP noted in section 5.2.117 These corpora are not just
one statement on their particualar kinds of dharma, but rather are col-
lections of materials—with varying degrees of thematic congru-
ence—relating to concerns raised by the notions of r(cid:2)jadharma and
(cid:2)paddharma. We shall shortly see that subsequent units have quite
different thematic concerns, matched by their own stylistic peculiari-
ties, though in interesting ways they connect to issues of (cid:2)paddharma
(and r(cid:2)jadharma) as well.

CHAPTER EIGHT
SETTING THINGS RIGHT:
TRANSITIONAL TEXTS OF THE (cid:4)PADDHARMAPARVAN I
As stated at the close of the discussion of the previous unit, the (cid:2)DhP
now enters a new phase. The remainder of this parvan provides a tran-
sition from the (cid:2)DhP to the MDhP. In this sense, taken collectively,
these texts have a double function: on the one hand they facilitate the
drawing to a close of the kingly instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP se-
quence, and on the other hand they provide an introduction or prelude
to the themes of the MDhP. This implies that what we have before us
is a text that has to some degree been carefully constructed. It is also
the case that these texts vary considerably in content, and, therefore,
the relationship of each to the preceding and following didactic cor-
pora varies accordingly.
Within this closing sequence of texts, the seven discussed in this
chapter (SUs 18-24) constitute a distinct sub-section. Each of these
units contains an exposition of a particular topic that intersects with
the general thematic tendencies of the MDhP. In addition, in formal
terms, many of these texts share a propensity for analyses based on
lists or catalogues that build a description of their principal topics.
N(cid:8)lakaõñha explains the position of these units in the following
way:
tad evam (cid:2)paddharm(cid:2)n uktv(cid:2) r(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)m ar(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)ü ca sarv(cid:2)panm(cid:6)labh(cid:6)t(cid:2)n
doù(cid:2)n utpattipratibandhak(cid:2)n guõ(cid:2)ü(cid:3) ca lobh(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)nadamatapaþsaty(cid:2)d(cid:5)n
hey(cid:2)n up(cid:2)dey(cid:2)ü(cid:3) ca krameõ(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)yasaptaken(cid:2)ha—p(cid:2)pasya yad
adhiùñh(cid:2)nam ity(cid:2)din(cid:2)|
Thus having discussed the dharmas of distress, through the next seven
chapters he speaks sequentially about the evils that are at the root of all
distress ((cid:2)pad) for kings and non kings, and the qualities—which ought
to be taken on or avoided—impeding the arising [of those evils], such
as greed, ignorance, self-restraint, austerity and truth. So he begins,
‘that which is the basis of evil’.
N(cid:8)lakaõñha clearly construes the next seven units as contiguous with
those that precede them. This, in my view, is quite a sensible position.
These texts reimpose a normative behavioural order, from the perspec-
tive of which (cid:2)pad can only be considered to originate in evil. Against
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 335
such ‘evil’ it is necessary to invoke proper standards of behaviour,
especially for kings and br(cid:3)hmans (the typical subjects of the follow-
ing units, as for the (cid:2)DhP in general); standards of behaviour which
work against the onset of this evil, and which must prevail once any
exceptional circumstances have passed. These texts, therefore, consti-
tute a reaffirmation of the principle that (cid:2)paddharma should be se-
verely circumscribed by time, place and occasion.
8.1 ‘The chapter on greed’ (Mbh 12.152; SU 18).
In this unit, Yudhiùñhira begins by stating his desire to know ‘the basis
of evil, and from where evil arises’.1 Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response then defines
the principal topic of this text, ‘greed alone is that insatiable beast;
from greed comes evil’.2 Greed (lobha) is then proffered as the basis
for all manner of negative qualities in 152.3-10. But this text is not
simply an enumeration of the different forms that evil takes, or a de-
nunciation of greed. It becomes, rather, a yogic formulation of a tradi-
tional br(cid:3)hmaõic view that the properly learned man ((cid:3)iùña—who, im-
plicitly, is a br(cid:3)hman) is the source of all things dharmic; and, the flip
side of this, the dangers posed by those who are not properly educated
(a(cid:3)iùña).
Once an account has been given of the different kinds of evil that
originate from greed, consecutive stanzas juxtapose the self controlled
person (jit(cid:2)tman), by whom ‘greed, along with confusion, is over-
come’,3 with the ‘greedy people who are uncultured’ (lubdh(cid:2)n(cid:2)m
ak(cid:8)t(cid:2)tman(cid:2)m), among whom the vices are found (152.14). In the pre-
sent context the issue at stake is the proper identification of the people
the king ought to recognise as the proper authorities on matters of
dharma. Stanza 152.15 is the first of five which describes the kind of
person whom a king must avoid:
sumah(cid:2)nty api (cid:3)(cid:2)str(cid:2)õi dh(cid:2)rayanti bahu(cid:3)rut(cid:2)þ|
chett(cid:2)raþ saü(cid:3)ay(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü ca kli(cid:3)yant(cid:5)h(cid:2)lpabuddhayaþ||
Very learned men who maintain the teachings though they are copious
and who cut away doubts, but who, having little understanding, suffer
here.

3 152.13ef sa lobhaþ sama mohena vijetavyo jit(cid:2)tman(cid:2)||
336 CHAPTER EIGHT
These people ‘suffer’ ((cid:2)kli(cid:3)) because they are afflicted by the various
negative qualities already enumerated in the preceding stanzas, quali-
ties sometimes (though not here) called kle(cid:3)as (a cognate of the verb
(cid:2)kli(cid:3)). This stanza returns to an issue we have already encountered in
the (cid:2)DhP; it is not the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras by themselves that are important in the
establishment and application of dharma, since the (cid:3)(cid:2)stras can be
made to say anything. Rather, as we shall shortly see, only those peo-
ple who have a close connection with the maintenance of a particular
tradition of learning, and who have especially meritorious qualities,
are suitable for the king to consult on matters of dharma. In contrast,
the people described in 152.15 are considered, in 152.16b, to ‘act out-
side the behavioural norms of properly learned people’ ((cid:3)iùñ(cid:2)c(cid:2)ra-
bahiùk(cid:8)ta), and to create confusion and interpret dharma with their
own interests in mind (152.16c-f, 17). If these ‘evil people in the grip
of greed’ (lobhagrastair dur(cid:2)tmabhiþ) are considered authorities, then
whatever rule (saüsth(cid:2)) is ‘perverted’ by them could be accepted as a
rule of law.4 The king must, therefore, avoid these people, recognising
them as the a(cid:3)iùña, the ‘uneducated’, who are ‘always filled with
greed’ (nityaü lobhasamanvit(cid:2)n).5
The king is thus told, in 152.20-1, to only consult (pari+(cid:2)prach)
properly educated ((cid:3)iùña) people who hold dear the ‘conduct of the
learned’ ((cid:3)iùñ(cid:2)c(cid:2)ra), and who are self-restrained (dama). These people
show no special favour to anyone (151.22-4), they are equanimous,
uninterested in personal gain, serving dharma merely for its own sake
(152.26-30). It is the particular traditional education these individuals
receive, coupled with what might be called a certain ‘yogic’ attitude,
that makes them especially fit purveyors and champions of dharma.
Stanza 152.25 emphasises the continuity of tradition:
na teù(cid:2)ü bhidyate v(cid:8)ttaü yat pur(cid:2) s(cid:2)dhubhiþ k(cid:8)tam|
na tr(cid:2)sino na capal(cid:2) na raudr(cid:2)þ satpathe sthit(cid:2)þ||
Among them there has been no break in the traditional conduct which
good people practised in times past; neither fearful, capricious nor fero-
cious, they remain firmly on the path of those righteous people.

stanza to 152.18 occurs at MDhP 252.11, where both the context, and the meaning,
however, is somewhat different (on this see Hara, “A note on dharmasya s(cid:6)kùma ga-
tiþ,” p.522.)
5 152.19.
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 337
The importance of the (cid:3)iùña in many traditional br(cid:3)hmaõic accounts of
dharma and its sources has already been discussed.6 In these accounts
two aspects are usually stressed: the relationship of the (cid:3)iùña to scrip-
ture and the (cid:3)iùña’s exemplary conduct. GDhS 28.48, for example, in
discussing the problem of what to do when dharma is unclear
(an(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)te), declares that what a panel of ten people who are ‘properly
educated, skilled in reasoning, and have no greed’ ((cid:3)iùñair (cid:6)havidbhir
alubdhaiþ) commend (pra(cid:3)asta) should be followed, or if these are
unavailable, then what is said by a ‘learned and cultured br(cid:3)hman
skilled in the Veda’ ((cid:3)rotriyo vedavicchiùño), because such a person ‘is
not capable of favouring or hurting anybody’ (aprabhavo bh(cid:6)t(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü
hiüs(cid:2)nugrahayogeùu).7 Similarly, the VDhS describes a (cid:3)iùña as ‘a
man who is free from desire’ (ak(cid:2)m(cid:2)tma),8 and later further defines
the (cid:3)iùña in connection to his study of the Veda in a continuous tradi-
tion.9 Of all the dharmas(cid:6)tras, however, Baudh(cid:3)yana offers the most
interest for the present discussion. BDhS 1.1.6 defines the (cid:3)iùña in re-
lation to his close study of the Veda, but this is preceded by a passage
that is an early formulation of the kind of yogic description offered in
this unit (BDhS 1.1.5):
(cid:3)iùñ(cid:2)þ khalu vigatamatsar(cid:2) nirahaük(cid:2)r(cid:2)þ kumbh(cid:5)dh(cid:2)ny(cid:2) alolup(cid:2)
dambhadarpalobhamohakrodhavivarjit(cid:2)þ||
Now, properly educated people are free from envy and egotism, have
just a jarful of grain, are free of desire, and shun deceit, arrogance,
greed, folly and anger.10
Evidently, the concern in SU 18 for the (cid:3)iùña’s connection with ‘un-
broken’ tradition11 and his exemplary conduct is partly rooted in these
early definitions of the (cid:3)iùña in the dharmas(cid:6)tras. However, if this
(cid:2)DhP text differs from these traditional accounts of the (cid:3)iùña, it is to
the degree that it emphasises the (cid:3)iùña’s ‘yogic’ traits, and a corre-
sponding downplaying of the (cid:3)iùña’s relationship to scripture. While it

10 This is similar to the grammarian Pata(cid:9)jali’s definition of a (cid:3)iùña (as also in other
details) in his Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)ùya, see M.M. Deshpande “The Changing Notion of (cid:6)iùña
from Pata(cid:9)jali to Bhart(cid:7)hari,” Asiatische Studien, 47.1 (1993), p.97. Cf. (cid:2)DhS 1.20.8,
2.29.14, though not using the word (cid:3)iùña.

grammarian Bhart(cid:7)hari’s similar concern.
338 CHAPTER EIGHT
would be going too far to say that scripture is dismissed in this text,
apart from the ironic bahu(cid:3)ruta, ‘very learned’, and the reference to
(cid:3)(cid:2)stra in 152.15, which emphasise the dangers of relying on scripture
alone, there is no reference to the sacred texts of the Veda or the sm(cid:8)ti.
This is in striking contrast to the dharma texts already cited, which
almost invariably emphasise the connection of the ‘learned’ to the
Veda. Even the above cited 152.25, which stresses the unbroken tradi-
tion, does so in reference to conduct (v(cid:8)tta), not scripture. SU 18 is
much more concerned that the (cid:3)iùña exhibit the qualities of the yogin,
that he be impartial, and unswayed by personal interest and his own
material gain.12
The yogic attitudes emerging in the dharmas(cid:6)tra definitions, espe-
cially in the BDhS, become even more heightened in this unit, so
much so that it begins to reflect more typically yogic texts, such as the
BhG and the so-called ‘minor upaniùads’. It emphatically describes,
for example, the equanimity a (cid:3)iùña should display: they ‘regard all
things equally’ (samadar(cid:3)ina),13 ‘gain and loss, joy and misery … the
favoured and unfavoured, death and life’ they consider equal (sama).14
Emblematic of this ‘yogic’ perspective is the co-occurrence of the two
words nirmama and nirahaük(cid:8)ta (-k(cid:2)ra), found twice in this text, as
in, for example, 152.26:15
te sevy(cid:2)þ s(cid:2)dhubhir nityaü yeùv ahiüs(cid:2) pratiùñhit(cid:2)|

They are always served by good people, a non-violent attitude is firmly
established in them, they are at a remove from desire and anger, they
have no regard for notions of ‘mine’ and are free from egotism, they are
very strict in their observances and keep firmly to the laws. It is they
you must revere and question!
Though we have seen already that BDhS uses nirahaük(cid:2)ra in refer-

with nirahaük(cid:2)ra is rarer still. According to Vi(cid:5)va Bandhu’s Vaidika-
ko(cid:3)a, both of these words are found quite often in the ‘minor upa-
niùads’ (but not in the ‘major upaniùads’), texts that revolve around a
framework provided by yoga, asceticism, liberation and bhakti.17
These two words co-occur twice in the BhG, at 2.71 and 12.13,18 in
passages concerning karmayoga which resonate remarkably with the
passage being discussed here. K(cid:7)ùõa’s karmayoga, of course, teaches
that a person should perform action in accordance with his duty with-
out regard for the results of that action. It therefore stresses the virtues
of indifference, of selfless acting and of self-restraint in the perform-
ance of duties. Accordingly, the yogin is someone who, seeking peace
((cid:3)(cid:2)nti),19 ‘has no regard for notions of ‘mine’, is free from egotism,
regards pleasure and pain as equal and is patient’.20 These two words
also occur (together and separately) in similarly ‘yogic’ contexts
elsewhere in the Mbh.21
This concentration of yogic virtues in the image of the (cid:3)iùña in SU
18 bears witness to the coalescence of a tradition around certain ex-
emplary forms of conduct and attitudes of mind that underlie these
forms of conduct.22 While this text displays a suspicion of scripture,23
a suspicion found elsewhere in the (cid:2)DhP, at the same time attributes
of the learned br(cid:3)hman appear to be merging with those of the yogin.

nirmama. See Schrader’s ed. pp.26 and 71 respectively (trans. by Olivelle, Saüny(cid:2)sa

340 CHAPTER EIGHT
8.2 ‘The chapter on ignorance’ (Mbh 12.153; SU 19)
This quite short unit is in many ways thematically continuous with the
previous SU. Indeed, Yudhiùñhira establishes at least a rhetorical con-
nection in the first stanza, by first acknowledging the lesson in SU 18,
‘greed was described as the foundation of what is bad’,24 and then as-
serting his desire to hear about ignorance (aj(cid:9)(cid:2)na). This unit has a
slightly unusual structure, in that Bh(cid:8)ùma first makes a brief initial
statement (IS),25 before Yudhiùñhira prompts Bh(cid:8)ùma to describe ‘ig-
norance’ in more detail. In doing so, the latter further connects this
and the previous units by drawing the discussion into the ambit of
greed (lobha).
While there is the occasional difficulty in clearly understanding
some passages,26 the general message is straightforward: ignorance
and greed ought to be avoided. Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial statement concerns the
negative consequences of ignorance. A person who performs evil out
of ignorance, ‘doesn’t know what’s good for him’ (n(cid:2)tmano vetti ca
kùamam), despises the ‘conduct of good people’ (s(cid:2)dhuv(cid:8)tta), and
‘becomes infamous among the people’ (lokasyaiti v(cid:2)cyat(cid:2)m).27 Be-
cause of his ignorance he goes to hell (niraya), and a ‘bad course’
(durgati),28 he attains pain (kle(cid:3)a), and sinks (nimajjati) into calamities
((cid:2)patsu).29 With the latter, a connection is established, even if some-
what superficially, to the general discourse of ‘calamities’, a point we
shall return to shortly.

25See FIGURE 8 p.179 above.
26 For example, neither the pronoun etay(cid:2) nor tasya in 153.8a and 12a respectively
have a clear antecedent. Both Belvalkar (p.942) and Fitzgerald (The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,
vol.7, p.771) discuss the former. My own feeling is that this refers to the whole group
of elements enumerated in 153.6-7 (so Fitzgerald, and suggested as a less preferable
option by Belvalkar). The latter I regard as referring to the argument of 153.11 (that
’the course of the soul through time is the root of greed’), so that tasy(cid:2)j(cid:9)(cid:2)n(cid:2)t tu lobho
in 153.12a would mean ‘from the ignorance of that [that greed is caused by time]
comes greed’ (pace Fitzgerald’s ‘From one’s ignorance comes greed’).
27 153.2.
28 I take durgati here to refer to the ‘bad course’ that the soul takes as it transmi-
grates from one existence to the next (cf. Mbh 6.28.40 [BhG 6.40]). Gati often has the
sense of transmigration in MS, e.g. 6.73; 12.41-50 (cf. the use of gati in (cid:2)DhP
153.11b). Durgati is sometimes also a synonym for (cid:2)pad, but this is untenable here
because of the occurrence of (cid:2)pad in the next line.
29 153.3.
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 341
Yudhiùñhira wants to know more, and asks in 153.4 about the ‘con-
tinuous progress’ (prav(cid:8)tti) of ignorance, its ‘continued existence’
(sth(cid:2)na), ‘full growth’ (v(cid:8)ddhi), ‘decay and rise’ (kùayodayau), its
‘root, activity, course, time, cause and reason’ (m(cid:6)laü yogaü gatiü
k(cid:2)laü k(cid:2)raõaü hetum eva ca). Once Bh(cid:8)ùma has listed the different
forms of aj(cid:9)(cid:2)na in 154.6-7, each is discussed in more or less the same
terms as the question posed by Yudhiùñhira.30 The fifteen terms in the
list (dveùa is repeated for no apparent reason), which include epis-
temic psychological states like moha ‘confusion’, but also more typi-
cally emotional states like r(cid:2)ga ‘passion’ and dveùa ‘hatred’, show
that what is meant by aj(cid:9)(cid:2)na is not simply ‘non-knowing’ in episte-
mological terms, but something with far broader ontological and psy-
chological implications. This is to be expected given the position and
significance of j(cid:9)(cid:2)na in Indian soteriological theories. Stanza 153.9
establishes an equation between ignorance and ‘excessive greed’ (ati-
lobha), they are ‘equal in fruit and equal in fault’ (samaphalau sama-
doùau). Ignorance has its origin in greed; as greed grows so does igno-
rance, as greed decays so does ignorance, and so on (153.10). As the
text progresses, it shifts more and more to the topic of greed alone,
thus in 153.12, ‘all faults are due to greed, therefore one should avoid
greed’,31 and in 153.13 various princes are mentioned as having at-
tained heaven because of the ‘deline of their greed’ (lobhakùay(cid:2)d).
Clearly Yudhiùñhira is meant to emulate them, since the chapter closes
with the direct injunction (153.14): ‘you yourself must abandon greed
in this world’ (tyaja lobham ih(cid:2)tman(cid:2)), then ‘you will meet happiness
in this and the next world’ (sukhaü loke pretya c(cid:2)nucariùyasi).
While this elucidation of greed clearly resonates with the previous
text, the orientation also differs in a significant way. Greed is dis-
cussed specifically in reference to the behaviour of kings, not in rec-
ognising indications of greed in others. It is therefore worthwhile re-
considering the superficiality of the connection between ignorance
(and therefore greed) and the general topic of calamities, apparently
formulated in 153.3. This text is part of a common thematic thread in
regard to kingship that runs through texts like the KA and the MS. We
have discussed already the inclusion in the KA, under the general
topic of calamities (vyasana), the specific vices (vyasana) that can

30 N(cid:8)lakaõñha attempts to account for each element of Yudhiùñhira’s question in
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response, but it is not quite as precise as that.

afflict a king, and therefore his kingdom.32 A similar passage occurs in
the MS 7.44ff., in which the vices (in similarity with the KA) are ana-
lysed in terms of those born from ‘desire’ (k(cid:2)ma) and those born from
‘anger’ (krodha); interestingly, in MS 7.49, these are declared to be
founded upon greed (lobha). The point of both passages is that the
king risks the well-being of his kingdom if he is consumed by vices.
So much is this so that MS 7.53 makes it quite clear that, for a king,
between death and vices, death is better. Both texts have the same so-
lution, the king must exercise self-control ((cid:2)tmavan, jitendriya, etc.)
in the exercise of his power.33 It is only the self-controlled king who
can perform his royal duties properly, and thereby hope to ensure his
own pathway to heaven.
8.3 ‘The chapter on self-restraint’ (Mbh 12.154; SU 20)
Yudhiùñhira begins this unit by asking what is best ((cid:3)reyas) for br(cid:3)h-
mans (154.1-2). To this Bh(cid:8)ùma responds with the present text arguing
that dama, self-restraint, is the best dharma for br(cid:3)hmans (154.7). The
presentation of this topic is generally straight-forward, and interest
primarily lies in the relationship of the text to MDhP 213. Indeed, SU
20 appears to be a reformulation of this chapter, despite the fact that
MDhP 213 is syntactically later in the (cid:6)P. In the following I argue that
the expansion and reformulation of MDhP 213 in this text reflects the
transitory position of unit 20 between the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence and
the MDhP, and that, in the process of its reformulation, this text has
undergone some interesting rhetorical transformations.
The correspondences between this unit and other texts in the (cid:6)P
(and, in one case, in the MS) are shown in FIGURE 13. This table util-
ises four symbols: the sign = indicates an exact correspondence; v.l.
an almost exact correspondence, with just a minor variation in reading

33 See e.g. KA 1.6-7 which consider the importance of the king’s ‘control of his
senses’ (indriyajaya, jitendriya); KA 8.3.66 (discussed above p.67), which concerns
the king’s vices (vyasanas); MS 7.34, discussing the king who ‘does not subdue him-
self’ (ajit(cid:2)tman); 7.44, concerning the vices; 8.173, highlighting that the king should
be jitendriya in the administration of justice. Similarly, in MS 7.28 the king who is
ak(cid:8)t(cid:2)tman, and in 7.30 who is ‘greedy’ (lubdha) and ‘whose mind is immature’
(ak(cid:8)tabuddhi), shall find it difficult to administer justice (daõóa). See also Mbh 5.127-
9 for Duryodhana’s lack of self-restraint. Cf., in general, Sartha, and in charfe, The

case; and ? where the correspondence is suggestive, but less clearly
established than in the other cases. Texts other than MDhP 213 are

principal interest here.34
Clearly there is a close relationship between this unit and the text in
MDhP 213. Furthermore, correspondences other than those in 213 still
tend to be from the MDhP, reflecting the close relationship of this text
with the thematic tendencies of this sub-parvan. As for the precise
nature of the relationship between MDhP 213 and (cid:2)DhP 154, it would
seem that the MDhP was the ‘original’ version. One indicator of this,
though evidence of such a literary nature is an ambiguous discrimina-
tor in such cases, is that, of the two, MDhP 213 sticks closer to the
topic at hand and reads, therefore, as a more focused text, an impres-
sion strengthened the further one progresses through (cid:2)DhP 154. This
on its own would not be decisive evidence for the temporal prece-

dence of one over the other, since one might expect revisions of a text
(i.e., the opposite of what is being suggested here) to produce much
the same result. Yet other evidence favours the direction of 213 (cid:4) 154
as well. The general pattern of correspondences suggests the intersper-
sal of ‘newly’ introduced stanzas in 154 between sequences of verses
from 213. Similarly, it seems more credible to accept that 154.16ab,
for example, was formed under the influence of 213.9cd and 213.17b
than the other way around. Furthermore, as pointed out by Fitzgerald,
154.17cd appears to be a prosodic correction of 213.11ab, which does
little justice to the usual sense of janav(cid:2)da.35
But this unit is not simply a relocation of a MDhP text. In its posi-
tion in the (cid:2)DhP it has undergone some interesting changes, changes
that again indicate the creativity underlying intertextual (or intratex-
tual) relationships. While some of its expansions are merely de-
scriptive elaborations along the lines of the main theme of the text, as
with stanzas 154.18-21 or 154.32-6, other differences between the two
versions are more suggestive. In comparison with MDhP 213, there
seems to be a concerted effort in SU 20 to frame the theme of this text,
dama, in terms of dharma. Furthermore, this is done in the context of
a rhetoric which evokes the problematic idea of a multiplicity of
dharmas, an idea we have encountered already in the (cid:2)DhP. This rhe-
torical difference in the two texts is highlighted by the fact that the
word dharma appears just once in MDhP 213 (8cd). The point, how-
ever, is not that the latter text does not consider dama to be an aspect
of dharma. Rather, it is quite the opposite, such a fact being so obvi-
ous as to require no comment. In SU 20, on the other hand, it is pre-
cisely the question of what is the best dharma, in a context recognis-
ing a multiplicity of dharmas, that provides the motivation for this
text, and this seems to gain special potency due to the relation of this
question to the problematization of fixed notions of proper conduct
entertained in discussions of (cid:2)paddharma.
These two related aspects, dharma and its multiplicity, are given
special focus in the opening stanzas of SU 20. In his pra(cid:3)na (154.1),
Yudhiùñhira asks what is the ‘best thing’ ((cid:3)reyas) for a br(cid:3)hman who
‘desires dharma’ (dharmak(cid:2)ma), reiterating this request in the next
stanza (154.2) by asking to be told what is the ‘best thing in this di-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
35 Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata vol.7, p.771. Janav(cid:2)da typically means ‘gossip-
ing’, but this makes little sense here. Cf. Belvalkar’s awkward interpretation in the

SETTING THINGS RIGHT 345
versely viewed world’ (bahudh(cid:2)dar(cid:3)ane loke (cid:3)reyo yad iha …). Then,
in a stanza found elsewhere in the RDhP,36 he tellingly asserts that
‘this path of dharma is extensive, and has many branches’ (mah(cid:2)n
ayaü dharmapatho bahu(cid:3)(cid:2)kha(cid:3) …), which poses the problem of
which dharma ‘it is best to attend to’ (anuùñheyatama). What is ‘the
most important root’ (m(cid:6)laü paramaü) of this ‘huge, many branched
dharma’ (dharmasya mahato … bahu(cid:3)(cid:2)khasya …)?37 Bh(cid:8)ùma’s re-
sponse continues this same tendency to assert a singular virtue against
the background of a multiplicity of behavioural options, as in 154.6:
dharmasya vidhayo naike te te prokt(cid:2) maharùibhiþ|
svaü svaü vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nam (cid:2)(cid:3)ritya damas teù(cid:2)ü par(cid:2)yaõam||
More than one rule of dharma has been taught by the great sages, each
resorting to their own understanding;38 yet they each have self-restraint
as their principal objective.
This overt effort to establish dama as a preeminent form of dharma is
especially apparent in 154.7, which has transformed MDhP 213.2 in
such a way as to not so much effect its general meaning, but its rhe-
torical drive:
damaü niþ(cid:3)reyasaü pr(cid:2)hur v(cid:8)ddh(cid:2) ni(cid:3)cayadar(cid:3)inaþ|
br(cid:2)hmaõasya vi(cid:3)eùeõa damo dharmaþ san(cid:2)tanaþ|| 154.7
Those elders who know about life’s certainties say that self-restraint has
no better; self-restraint is especially the eternal law (dharma) of a
br(cid:3)hman.
damam eva pra(cid:3)aüsanti v(cid:8)ddh(cid:2)þ (cid:3)rutisam(cid:2)dhayaþ|
sarveù(cid:2)m eva varõ(cid:2)n(cid:2)ü br(cid:2)hmaõasya vi(cid:3)eùataþ|| 213.2
Those elders who are firmly attentive to the sacred tradition extol only
self-restraint especially for a br(cid:3)hman among all the social classes.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
36 154.3 = RDhP 109.1. In this latter instance the answer to the question is quite
different: honouring one’s mother, father and guru.
37 154.4. For a similar characterisation of dharma, see Mbh 3.200.2 (cf. Hara, “A
note on dharmasya s(cid:6)kùm(cid:2) gatiþ,” pp.520-1).
38 It is perhaps worth speculating if vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nam (cid:2)(cid:3)ritya is intended to echo assertions
made in quite different contexts in the (cid:2)DhP, where the multiplicity of dharmas pro-
vides the grounds for the use of the intellect in establishing the dharmic basis of con-
duct in times of distress. As, for example, vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabalam (cid:2)sth(cid:2)ya in 130.3, 139.11,
and, used synonymously in the same context, buddhim sam(cid:2)sth(cid:2)ya in 139.93 (cf.
139.94 buddhim (cid:2)sth(cid:2)ya). Such learned intellectualising is not open to just anyone.
Note, for example, the description in 139.94 of the person who employs these strate-
gies as ‘learned’ (vidv(cid:2)n) and ‘self restrained’ (yat(cid:2)tman).
346 CHAPTER EIGHT
The dharmic context of both statements is not in question. Yet, typi-
cally, it is only the former that overtly asserts this context. Further
statements in 154.10-11 reinforce the same impression, before this
rhetoric recedes somewhat and the text focuses more upon its princi-
pal topic.39
The combination of factors in this rhetorical reformulation of
MDhP 213 in SU 20 reflects, I believe, the transitional position of this
text between the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence and the MDhP. The former,
as we have seen in the (cid:2)DhP, frequently portrays the performance of
dharma as contingent upon context. While acknowledging this multi-
plicity of dharmas, SU 20 responds with a reassertion of an uncom-
promised, if idealised, form of dharma. This reassertion on the one
hand betrays a certain uneasiness with the kinds of ‘norms’ (cid:2)pad-
dharma implies, and on the other displays a clear concern for kinds of
behaviour that lead to ‘spiritual’, rather than material success. Criti-
cally, too, it is through the interaction of the body of this text with the
elements framing it, and a rhetorical reformulation of its principal ar-
guments, that this position is asserted, showing once again that a con-
textualised reading of such units must frequently take into account the
combination of the frame with the text the frame embeds.
Finally, one additional aspect of this text must be noted. This chapter
closes with the first appearance of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana in the (cid:2)DhP. The
two stanzas that constitute this appearance (154.37-8) serve three
functions. The first stanza forms a concluding statement (CS) to SU
20, reporting Yudhiùñhira’s exhilarated psychological state after hear-
ing Bh(cid:8)ùma’s pronouncement (the language reflects Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial
statement (IS) in 154.5); the second stanza is a pra(cid:3)na, reported by
Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana as spoken by Yudhiùñhira, for SU 21; and together
these two stanzas form a bridge between units 21-22 (i.e. they func-
tion as link statements (LS)). Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s presence has not been
felt in the (cid:6)P, in fact, since RDhP 71.14, which itself was his first ap-
pearance since 60.1. In the present context, he shortly reappears again
in (cid:2)DhP 160.1 (SU 26), 161.1 (SU 27) and 167.24 (SU 28), the last
three units of the (cid:2)DhP, and then again disappears as an interlocutor
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
39 This text has other curious expansions in 154.24 (a possible reformulation of
213.16) and 154.27-31, concerning karma.
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 347
for a substantial period of time until 326.121. As noted above,40 Vai-
(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana tends to reappear at transitional points in the narrative of
the Mbh. This would appear to be the function of his appearance in
this unit and units 26-28, all of which, I am arguing, are part of a lar-
ger collection of texts designed to form a transition between the
RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence and the MDhP. We are, so to speak, in the
middle of an end, and in preparation for a new beginning. Vai(cid:5)aü-
p(cid:3)yana’s reappearance draws us out of the Bh(cid:8)ùma/Yudhiùñhira inter-
locutory frame, briefly reminding us of the broader narrative context,
before we plunge once again into another set of texts with quite a dif-
ferent thematic focus (i.e., the MDhP).
8.4 ‘The chapter on austerity’ (Mbh 154.38-155.13; SU 21)
This relatively short unit contains a collection of stanzas valorising
tapas, ‘austerity’, or ‘ascetic heat’. As related at the end of the discus-
sion of the previous unit, the pra(cid:3)na for this SU is the last verse of
12.154. This is the only time in the (cid:2)DhP that the boundary of an SU
(as I have defined it) does not coincide with a boundary of a chapter.
Bh(cid:8)ùma’s opening statement begins with the broad assertion made by
the ‘poet-sages’ (kavayaþ) that ‘all this is founded upon ascetic heat’
(sarva etat tapom(cid:6)laü).
The collection of verses in this unit divides roughly into two
groups, and there seems good grounds to assume that this division re-
flects its actual text history. In the first case, the internal evidence of
the texts justifies this basic division, since there is close similarity in
both the style of presentation and the contents of 155.2-6 and 11-13 on
the one hand and 155.7-10 on the other. Stanzas 155.2-6, which (in
this order) are close variations of MS 11.243 and 11.236-9,41 laud the
efficaciousness of austerity by enumerating various situations in
which tapas (always in the instrumental case) was or is pivotal in the
accomplishment of a particular task. For example, in 155.2, referring
to the well known myth,42 ‘the lord Praj(cid:3)pati created all this through
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
40 See above p.166.
41 Furthermore, Mbh 13.123.7-8 are variations of (cid:2)DhP 155.5-6 and MS 11.238-9.
42 See e.g. W. Kaelber, Tapta M(cid:2)rga: Asceticism and Initiation in Vedic India, Al-
bany: SUNY, 1989, pp.30-1.
348 CHAPTER EIGHT
his ascetic heat alone’;43 in 155.4, ‘herbs, such as medicines and so on,
and the three perfected knowledges, are effective through tapas
alone’;44 and in 155.6, ‘a man frees himself from sin through well-per-
formed austerity alone’.45 After the sequence 155.7-10, this style re-
sumes in 155.11-13. The formally distinct sequence 155.7-10 attempts
to prioritise a particular type of asceticism as the most effective form
of tapas. Even though, ‘ascetic austerity has many forms’ (tapaso ba-
hur(cid:6)pasya), ‘there is no better austerity than fasting’ (tapo n(cid:2)na(cid:3)an(cid:2)t
param).46 This latter formula, which especially marks this sequence of
stanzas as separate from the remainder of the unit, is repeated in a
similar way in the next stanza, and again in 155.10 in a slightly differ-
ent context.47 As already noted, the last three stanzas return again to
the mode of presentation of the first part of the text. Further justifica-
tion for this basic division, and for the view that these two sequences
have a separate origin, is found in a sequence of verses at the end of
the Anug(cid:5)t(cid:2) in the (cid:4)(cid:3)vamedhikaparvan (Mbh 14.50.14-20) which fol-
lows the exact order of stanzas 155.2-12 with the omission of stanzas
7-10.48 Finally, there is manuscript evidence pointing to the conclusion
that 155.9-10 are themselves a later addition to this text, since, as
Fitzgerald has pointed out, those manuscripts upon which the Critical
Edition principally relied do not include them.49
In keeping with the transitional position of this unit, the most likely
explanation for the role it plays in the scheme of the (cid:2)DhP is twofold.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
43 155.2ab praj(cid:2)ptir idaü sarvaü tapasaiv(cid:2)s(cid:8)jat prabhuþ| MS 11.243 has the in-
teresting variant (cid:3)(cid:2)stram for sarvaü.

anti…||
45 155.6cd tapasaiva sutaptena naraþ p(cid:2)p(cid:2)d vimucyate||
46 155.7. The formula tapo n(cid:2)na(cid:3)an(cid:2)t param also occurs at Mbh 13.106.3d (cf.
13.106.41c) and 13.109.62d (note also the similarity between 13.109.62abc and (cid:2)DhP
155.9abc). Cf. also MNU 2.78 (as cited in Vi(cid:5)va Bandhu’s Vaidikako(cid:3)a; p.130 no.506
of Varenne’s trans.).
47 155.9, however, differs from this mode of presentation, asserting that saüny(cid:2)sa
is the ‘best austerity’ (paramaü tapaþ). 155.10 is an unusual verse: the ‘senses (in-
driya) guard here for the preservation of wealth and grain’ (iha rakùanti dhanadh(cid:2)ny-
(cid:2)bhiguptaye), ‘therefore, for material prosperity (artha) and for law (dharma), there is
no better austerity than fasting’ (tasm(cid:2)d arthe ca dharme ca tapo n(cid:2)na(cid:3)an(cid:2)t param).
Presumably by fasting one enhances the function of the senses.
48 Curiously, the (cid:4)(cid:3)vamedhikaparvan sequence, while generally closer to the
(cid:2)DhP, is occasionally closer to the MS, e.g. 14.50.18cd is the same as MS 11.239cd,
while 18ab is closer to (cid:2)DhP 155.6ab.
49 Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.772. Belvalkar attributes this to hap-
lographic omission.
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 349
Firstly, its evocation of the effectiveness of an ascetic lifestyle clearly
resonates with mokùa themes. Secondly, it also evokes the theme of
pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta, ‘expiation’. Stanza 155.6 explicitly refers to pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta
when it prescribes tapas to remove the sin which comes with ‘drink-
ing alcohol, theft, br(cid:3)hman-killing50 and violating a teacher’s bed’
(sur(cid:2)po ’saümat(cid:2)d(cid:2)y(cid:5) bhr(cid:6)õah(cid:2) gurutalpagaþ). It is worth noting in
this regard that the parallel stanzas occurring in the MS are found pre-
cisely in a section on pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta. Furthermore, we have already seen
that the expiation of sin is never far from the idea of (cid:2)paddharma. In-
deed, tapas is used for this very purpose in SU 12 by Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra to
absolve his sin of eating dog meat; by the bird-hunter in SU 14; and it
is described as the best purifier (pavitra) by Indrota (cid:6)aunaka in SU
15.51 Therefore, while it clearly shares in the thematic concerns of the
‘pre-MDhP’ mokùa sequence of units of which it is a part, it also dis-
plays some thematic relationship to the problems provoked by the no-
tion of (cid:2)paddharma.
8.5 ‘The chapter on the real’ (Mbh 12.156; SU 22)
This unit is both a panegyric (pra(cid:3)aüs(cid:2)) of satya, ‘what is true or real;
reality; truth’, and a description of its characteristics (lakùaõa). Noting
that ‘in regard to dharma, br(cid:3)hmans, sages, ancestors and gods extol
the real (or truth)’,52 Yudhiùñhira requests that Bh(cid:8)ùma tell him about
satya, asking ‘what characteristics does the real have?’53 and so on.
Yudhiùñhira’s opening pra(cid:3)na establishes, therefore, the generic pa-
rameters of this unit, and that its particular focus is satya as it relates
to dharma.
The first stanza of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s reply further clarifies what is at stake
(156.3):
c(cid:2)turvarõyasya dharm(cid:2)õ(cid:2)ü saükaro na pra(cid:3)asyate|
avik(cid:2)ritamaü satyaü sarvavarõeùu bh(cid:2)rata||
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
50 It seems likely that bhr(cid:6)nahan has this sense here, since this is clearly a list of
the standard mah(cid:2)p(cid:2)takas. Compare, e.g., similar lists of sins which have the form
brahma-han/-haty(cid:2): e.g. MS 9.235, 11.54; (cid:2)DhP 159.32, 166.24; GDhS 21.1, 24.10;
BDhS 1.18.18; KA 3.14.37; NS 19.50. Cf., however, Mbh 14.50.18 (a variation of
155.6) which contains both brahmahan and bhr(cid:6)õahan.
51 See respectively 139.63, 91; 145.2; 148.6-7. Cf. pp.316f. above.

350 CHAPTER EIGHT
The intermixture of the dharmas of the four social classes is not rec-
ommended. In regard to all the social classes, satya varies the least,
Bh(cid:3)rata.
Two aspects of this (cid:3)loka are of special interest. The first is the refer-
ence to the intermixture (saükara) of the varõas, which I have already
noted is the distinctive br(cid:3)hmaõic conception of the pathology of
dharma and the social order.54 The purpose of praising the universality
of satya is not to suggest that the boundaries between the social
classes should not be respected. Rather, we are here in the realm of the
s(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõa dharmas, the laws or forms of conduct applicable to all
social classes. As affirmation of this, the list of thirteen characteristics
of satya given in 156.8-9 show close similarity to lists of ‘generally
applicable’ dharmas enumerated in other contexts.55 It is sometimes
suggested that there is a degree of irreconcilable tension between the
specific dharmas that relate to individual social classes, gender and so
on, and the general dharmas that cut across these categories, since the
virtues recommended in the latter are often opposed to those rec-
ommended in the former.56 Such a view is overstated, and has been
justly criticised by Halbfass, who has noted its confusion of sva-
dharma and s(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõa dharma on the one hand, with niv(cid:8)tti dharma
and prav(cid:8)tti dharma on the other.57 There is, indeed, a hermeneutic
principle applied in such cases to forestall such confusion between the
application of vi(cid:3)eùadharma and s(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõadharma, a principle which
determines that the ‘specific rule’ (apav(cid:2)da) overrides the ‘general
rule’ (utsarga).58 In the present unit, therefore, the valorisation of
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
54 See above, pp.112, 278.
55 Cf. e.g. Mbh 12.60.7-8; 285.22-4; MS 10.63; YS 1.122; VDhS 4.4; KA 1.3.13.
(cid:2)DhS 2.25.1 acknowledges the existence of ‘particular’ and ‘general’ dharmas, with-
out listing the latter therein. Cf. Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.2 pt.1, pp.5-11.
56 See especially W.D. O’Flaherty, The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology, Berke-
ley: University of California Press, 1976, pp.95-6 (cf. O’Flaherty, “The Clash be-
tween relative and absolute duty: the dharma of demons,” in W.D. O’Flaherty and
J.D.M. Derrett (eds), The Concept of Duty in South Asia, South Asia Books, 1978,
pp.96-106). O’Flaherty somewhat misleadingly calls s(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõa dharma absolute and
‘eternal’ (san(cid:2)tana) dharma. As any scan of the use of san(cid:2)tana dharma reveals, any
dharma can be considered eternal. These views have been influential. Note their re-
production recently in Hill, Fate, Predestination, pp.105f.
57 India and Europe, p.554 n.101.
58 As noted in passing by Deshpande (“Historical Change,” p.142 and n.33), this
rule enables the brevity of the s(cid:6)tra style, and was probably developed by the gram-
marians, but is implicit in the dharma literature also. It was an important principle in
M(cid:5)m(cid:2)üs(cid:2) and in later exegetical traditions, although its applicability was sometimes
the subject of debate, especially in the context of the killing of animals. See W.
(cid:3)
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 351
satya as a permanent and generally applicable principle is not meant
to override the uniqueness and separation of the duties of each social
group.
The second key aspect of 156.3 is the particular characteristics it at-
tributes to satya, which assist in establishing its referent more pre-
cisely. In this regard Fitzgerald makes the following, typically pene-
trating, remark in a note to his translation:
The Law that is common to people of different varõas is based upon
something that is virtually identical in them, the ‘Real’ (satya), that
which has been “least transformed” (avik(cid:2)ritama) in the course of the
progressive emanation (sarga) of people from the ultimate source of all
that exists.59
Satya is as close to undifferentiated nature (prak(cid:8)ti) as to be almost
indistinguishable from it. Therefore it is distinguished from those
things in the world (such as the elements, the social classes, etc.)
which are modifications (vik(cid:2)ra) or productions from prak(cid:8)ti. Hence
satya is avik(cid:2)rin, never ‘liable to change’ (156.10). Any cosmogonic
aspect of this designation remains, however, unexplored in this unit,
and should not be overly stressed. Its primary purpose is to establish
the value of satya as a supreme virtue and, as is typical of br(cid:3)hmaõic
apologetics, this is done by characterising it as timeless and unchang-
ing.
The body of the text in this unit consists of the enumeration and de-
scription of the characteristics (lakùaõa) of the ‘thirteen’ forms of the
‘real’. These are initially listed in (cid:3)lokas 156.8-9:
satyaü ca samat(cid:2) caiva dama(cid:3) caiva na saü(cid:3)ayaþ|
am(cid:2)tsaryaü kùam(cid:2) caiva hr(cid:5)s titikù(cid:2)nas(cid:6)yat(cid:2)||

ahiüs(cid:2) caiva r(cid:2)jendra saty(cid:2)k(cid:2)r(cid:2)s trayoda(cid:3)a||
There’s no doubt that truth, impartiality, self-restraint, unselfishness,
patience, modesty, forbearance, non-spitefulness, renunciation, medita-

Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection, pp.93f (p.117 n.26), 112; J. Houben, “To kill or
not to kill,” p.146 n.76. Interestingly, it is precisely in terms of apav(cid:2)da that
Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra justifies his eating of dog meat in (cid:2)DhP 139.84 (see above p.279). In the
introduction to her translation of the MS, Doniger (p.lv) cites this very principle to
account for some apparent contradictions in Manu (citing (cid:2)(cid:5)v(cid:6)S 1.1.22). For the
grammatical background, see G. Cardona, “Some Principles of P(cid:3)õini’s Grammar,”
JIP, 1 (1970), pp.40-74.

352 CHAPTER EIGHT
tion, nobility, firm and constant resolve, and not hurting other beings,
lord of kings, are the thirteen forms of what is ‘real’.
These thirteen different forms are then described in more detail in
stanzas 156.10-21, in the order of their initial enumeration. Each de-
scription generally consists of both the attributes of the form under
consideration, and the means to attaining that form of satya (in keep-
ing with Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na, which indeed asks how satya ‘can be
obtained’ (avapyate) in 156.2b). Once these thirteen forms of satya
have been discussed, the final (cid:3)lokas return to lauding the ‘real’.60
Oddly, the text as it is constituted in the Critical Edition does not in-
clude a discussion of either dhy(cid:2)na ‘meditation’ or anus(cid:6)yat(cid:2) ‘non-
spitefulness’. A number of mainly southern manuscripts make up for
these lacunae by supplying appropriate explanations.61 N(cid:8)lakaõñha, on
the other hand, suggests that they have not been discussed because
they are covered by the explanations of renunciation (ty(cid:2)ga) and for-
bearance (titikù(cid:2)) respectively.
This panegyric appears here as a moral counterpoint to the discus-
sions of lobha and aj(cid:9)(cid:2)na which occur in its immediate vicinity (SUs
18 and 19 respectively), and there is good reason to consider it a pair
with the thirteen doùas in the next unit, and to the wider context of the
(cid:2)paddharmas of the (cid:2)DhP. In keeping with its close relationship to
the notion of s(cid:2)dh(cid:2)raõadharma, the point is not necessarily to critique
the application of the teachings of the (cid:2)DhP, but to restrict them to
their proper domain as circumscribed by the appropriate social class,
and the proper place, time and occasion, for their pursuance. It is gen-
erally better to pursue the morals espoused here; but this does not oc-
clude the need for other forms of conduct as the occasion demands. A
subtle ambivalence, therefore, accompanies the placement of this unit
here; (cid:2)paddharma, in both its political and personal forms, is as nec-
essary as it is distasteful.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
60 Some of these appear elsewhere: 156.24a (n(cid:2)sti saty(cid:2)t paro dharmo) = Mbh
1.69.24a; 156.24ab = NS 1.206ab; 156.26 = Mbh 1.69.22; 13.23.14ab; 13.74.29; NS
1.192. The latter favourably compares satya with a thousand a(cid:3)vamedhas, a quite
common comparison in the literature.
61 405* and 406* in D7 T G1.2.5. (In his note to this verse, Belvalkar mistakenly
refers to am(cid:2)tsarya rather than anus(cid:6)yat(cid:2).)
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 353
8.6 ‘The dissolution of anger and so on’ (Mbh 12.157; SU 23)
This unit should be construed as a pair with the preceding text. This
pairing is made evident in Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na (157.1-2) which lists
thirteen negative emotional and psychological states that should be
avoided, and which must surely have been constructed as a direct
counterpoint to the thirteen aspects of satya found in the previous unit:
yataþ prabhavati krodhaþ k(cid:2)ma(cid:3) ca bharatarùabha|
(cid:3)okamohau vivits(cid:2) ca par(cid:2)sutvaü tath(cid:2) madaþ||

etat sarvaü mah(cid:2)pr(cid:2)j(cid:9)a y(cid:2)th(cid:2)tathyena me vada||
From where anger arises, and desire, bull of Bharatas, grief, confusion,
excessive inquisitiveness, listlessness and pride, greed, jealousy, spite,
contempt, indignation and pity, tell me truthfully about all this, great
wise man.
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, a tendency for creating lists
is typical of the sequence of units 18-24. In addition to this unit’s con-
trapuntual relationship to SU 22, it also operates within a similar the-
matic sphere to SUs 18 and 19. Occasionally there is even verbal simi-
larity, for example 152.7a is the same as 157.7a.62 Unsurprisingly, SUs
18, 19 and 23 also share a tendency to link their topics to the origin of
misery (duþkha) and evil (p(cid:2)pa).63 In this unit, Bh(cid:8)ùma announces that
he will describe the ‘creation, continued existence and destruction’
(udayaü sth(cid:2)naü kùayam ca) of the thirteen elements listed in
Yudhiùñhira’s pra(cid:3)na, and then proceeds to analyse most of the thir-
teen in terms of at least the first and last of these three processes.64
This type of analysis also recalls that proposed for aj(cid:9)(cid:2)na in SU 19,65
though in this case it is pursued more thoroughly. In the analysis of
these terms in the body of this unit (157.7-17), the formal parallelism
with the preceding unit becomes even more obvious (though it is
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
62 lobh(cid:2)t krodhaþ prabhavati …| Perhaps because of this pada, some manuscript
colophons (like SU 18) call this unit lobh(cid:2)dhyayaþ, and two call it punar lobh(cid:2)-
dhy(cid:2)yaþ.
63 E.g. 152.1-3; 153.2, 5; 157.5.
64 Only the first two terms (krodha and k(cid:2)ma) are analysed in terms of all three.
65 See 153.4-5 and especially 153.10. Curiously, this type of analysis is reminiscent
of that found in political contexts, usually in terms of v(cid:8)ddhi, sth(cid:2)na and kùaya, e.g.
KA 6.2.5; 7.1.20-38 (prakaraõa kùayasth(cid:2)nav(cid:8)ddhini(cid:3)cayah); 7.12.29-30; Mbh
5.34.10; 38.22; 12.59.31; 69.67. It would be premature to attribute too much signifi-
cance to this. But perhaps this is an indication of the context of the reception of this
discourse; i.e. that it is pitched to a courtly audience.
354 CHAPTER EIGHT
worth noting that, unlike the earlier unit, the order in which the terms
are analysed in this text does not strictly follow their original enu-
meration). The origin of each term is first described, followed by a
description of the way in which it can be eliminated. Curiously, as
with SU 22, the text of the Critical Edition of this unit also omits a
discussion of two terms (lobha and moha), though an account of them
is found in a significant number of manuscripts.66
The concluding stanza (CS) of three hemistichs is worthy of brief dis-
cussion (157.18):
et(cid:2)ny eva jit(cid:2)ny (cid:2)huþ pra(cid:3)am(cid:2)c ca trayoda(cid:3)a|

These thirteen, they say, are conquered through tranquillity. The sons of
Dh(cid:7)tar(cid:3)ùñra had all thirteen of these sins; they were continually over-
come by you with all your heart, and you will conquer these [sins].
This is the second time there has been an explicit reference to an as-
pect of the Mbh narrative in the closing stages of an (cid:2)DhP unit,67 a
rhetorical technique which draws these didactic texts into the broader
epic narrative context,68 as if pointing to the narrative in order to dem-
onstrate that the pedagogies contained in the didactic corpora are not
simply theoretical musings, but have practical applications as well.
This stanza echoes another ‘thirteen’, though it may stretch credibility
to suggest that there is a sin for each of the thirteen years the Dh(cid:3)rta-
r(cid:3)ùñras forced the P(cid:3)õóavas into exile. But perhaps it is credible to
suggest some kind of homological numeralism here,69 wherein the
number ‘thirteen’ evokes a narrative context against which to set these
teachings.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
66 411* and 412*; these stanzas begin in the same way (aj(cid:9)(cid:2)naprabhavo mohaþ/
lobho), suggesting a compositional relationship between the two. However, they do
not always co-occur in the same manuscripts (see the notes to the CE). The latter star
passage is especially found in many of the manuscripts, including the editorially sig-
nificant (cid:6) and K.
67 The first is found at 151.32-3, where the merit of power (bala) is extolled
through a comparison with Arjuna, who was more than the equal of the eighteen ar-
mies of the war.
68 See also above p.156.
69 In a similar way to the series of connections stimulated by the number eighteen
in the Mbh and beyond. See e.g. van Buitenen, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.3, pp.141-2.
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 355
This stanza also seems to evoke a particular stage in the broader
narrative of Yudhiùñhira’s instruction, a stage reflected in the transi-
tional position of this unit. The first two padas, which tell us that the
thirteen doùas can be defeated through pra(cid:3)ama, ‘tranquillity’, reflect
Fitzgerald’s thesis that the (cid:7)(cid:2)ntiparvan represents the appeasement,
the “cooling process”, of Yudhiùñhira’s “disabling inner heat”,70 a heat
which manifests in the anger and grief he passionately expresses in the
opening chapters to the (cid:6)P.71 Having won the war, Yudhiùñhira can
devote himself to the cultivation of the royal virtue of self-control that
enables the ongoing and effective rule of the kingdom. By implication,
this stanza suggests that it is precisely because the Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras failed
in this virtue during their period of rule (thirteen years), giving in to
their baser emotions of anger and greed, that they lost the great war; a
loss which, in a symbolic circle, further signifies their personal limita-
tions.72 Now that the tangible and gross enemy of the Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras is
done with, Yudhiùñhira can devote himself to the real enemies, the
emotional and psychological bases of evil, and win the final inner war
that guarantees both the prosperity of the kingdom and his own beati-
tude.73 And this war to control the self, fought with such weapons as
yoga and salvific knowledge (j(cid:9)(cid:2)na), will be the special topic of the
following great book of instruction in the (cid:6)P, the MDhP. Once again,
in a minor yet significant way, this stanza mirrors the general trans-
formation that Yudhiùñhira is undergoing as a result of this instruction,
a transformation reflected on the architectonic level of the (cid:6)P by the
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
70 Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, pp.95-100.
71 E.g. (cid:6)P 1.24, 39; 17.1-6. See above pp.136f.
72 This passage can be usefully compared to the words of G(cid:3)ndh(cid:3)r(cid:8) in 5.127, who
berates Duryodhana for being greedy and not making peace with the P(cid:3)õóavas. G(cid:3)n-
dh(cid:3)r(cid:8) extols the virtue of self-control, without which a king cannot rule his kingdom
(127.20-9), and conversely (127.30) warns against ‘lust and anger’ (k(cid:2)makrodha),
which ‘rip prudence apart’ (vi+(cid:2)lump; cf. 12.157.4). She demands (5.127.46) that he
be satisfied with his thirteen year humiliation (nik(cid:2)ra) of the P(cid:3)õóavas, and pacify
((cid:3)amaya) his animosity towards them, which has been ‘swelled by anger and greed’
(k(cid:2)makrodhasamedhita), and (127.53) he should let go of his greed (lobha) and calm
down (pra(cid:3)(cid:2)mya). Duryodhana, of course, does not follow G(cid:3)ndh(cid:3)r(cid:8)’s advice, and the
consequences are disastrous for the Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras and the Kuru-realm.
73 Bh(cid:8)ma calls Yudhiùñhira to a similar ‘inner battle’ at (cid:6)P 16.21-23 (with thanks to
Simon Brodbeck for this reference), a battle Yudhiùñhira then begins in (cid:6)P 17, in
which he verabalises opposing positions. See also Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,
vol.7, p.694; Hiltebeitel “A(cid:5)vaghoùa’s Buddhacarita,” p.270 and n.102 (drawing fu-
ther attention to Arjuna at (cid:6)P 22.10).

position of this unit between the socially oriented royal instructions,
and the individually oriented instructions on salvation.
8.7 ‘The chapter on bad men’ (Mbh 12.158; SU 24)
This is the last of the sequence of seven units that form a sub-section
within the closing, transitional, collection of SUs in the (cid:2)DhP. In this
case, the topic of this brief chapter concerns the proper characteristics
of the n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsa, the ‘cruel man’. Like other units within this sequence,
the expository procedure of the text strings together, in a parallel but
opposite fashion to a pra(cid:3)aüsana, a catalogue of descriptive elements
to build up a picture of the n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsa. Such a man is thoroughly un-
trustworthy (and untrusting), mischievous, duplicitous, ignorant, un-
caring and completely self-interested.
At the simplest level, this is all the text constitutes, a description of
the kind of bad person that should always be avoided. There are some
obvious practical purposes for this, since it is desirable not only for
people to act without cruelty, especially kings (like Yudhiùñhira), but
also for a king to recognise cruelty in others. But is this all that can be
said of this unit? What might the context of this catalogue suggest? In
the first instance, the transitional position of this text points to a need
to recall and reaffirm—as if to allay any doubts—the proper character-
istics of bad people, now that the sometimes morally ambiguous
teachings of the royal instructions are coming to a close, and the in-
structions on liberation, where personal qualities count for so much,
are about to begin. Yet there is a broader context too, which brings
into play the ambivalence Yudhiùñhira displays throughout the Mbh.
In his opening pra(cid:3)na Yudhiùñhira directly points to the contrast be-
tween n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsa and its negation, the often extolled virtue of (cid:2)n(cid:8)-
(cid:3)aüsya, ‘gentleness, kindness, benevolence, absence of cruelty’
(158.1):74

74 On this word, see M. Lath, “The concept of (cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsya in the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,” in
R.N. Dandekar (ed.), The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata Revisited, New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi,
1990, pp.113-19, who suggests that (cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsya is a new ethic promoted by the Mbh,
partly as an alternative to ahiüs(cid:2). See also Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata,
pp.202ff.; Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.113.
SETTING THINGS RIGHT 357
I understand kindness by always looking among the virtuous, but I do
not understand bad people or their actions, Bh(cid:3)rata.
Yudhiùñhira is often connected to the virtue of (cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsya. Indeed, we
have already seen instances in the (cid:6)P where he is criticised for being
too beholden to this virtue, so that it gets in the way of the proper per-
formance of his royal duties.75 In his discussion of the so called Yakùa-
pra(cid:3)na section of the (cid:4)raõyakaparvan, David Shulman has drawn at-
tention to Yudhiùñhira’s extolling of this virtue as the highest
dharma.76 In particular, he points to the ironic implications of this,
since Yudhiùñhira:
… is a prime actor in a violent disaster on a universal scale … He
fights, kills, makes demands, including the possessive claims inherent
to kingship, and colludes, however reluctantly, in the general progres-
sion towards devastation. The dissonance between his values and his
actions is not merely cognitive but truly existential, and the result can
only be an accretion of irony to his proclamation in favour of non-
injury. The warrior committed to such an ideal is surely, in some sense,
an ironic figure.77
In such a seemingly straight-forwad and minor text as this, should we
read a similar ironic association? Is it a little too difficult to accept that
Yudhiùñhira does not understand cruel people or bad behaviour, espe-
cially given the critical stance he often assumes towards his own con-
duct during the great war? Is this another example of the “dissonance
between his values and actions”? Or is this imputing a motivation of
too great complexity for this unit? Or a too literal acceptance of the
character value of its interlocutors? Undoubtedly, the tension of
Yudhiùñhira’s moral crisis must be read into this text; it is not just laid
bare for us to see. But it must equally be asked whether a text like this
is included in innocence. Were its redactors ignorant of any broader
implications, whether ironic or otherwise, of Yudhiùñhira admitting his
knowledge of (cid:2)n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsya and his confusion over n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüsa? Was the
text included as a simple normative assertion of proper conduct? And
would this in itself constitute an interpretative act? Such questions
lead to two necessary and related questions, questions which gain in
importance in light of the successive redactions that supposedly un-
derlie the Mbh, and questions which must be asked anew with each
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
75 See e.g. Mbh 3.34.15 and above pp.144 and 151.
76 Mbh 3.297.55, 71.
77 Shulman, “The Yakùa’s Questions,” p.50.
358 CHAPTER EIGHT
and every text that constitutes the Mbh: to what extent is this great
text in conversation with itself? And to what extent should we read it
as in conversation with itself? These questions might have a ready
answer when asked in relation to an obviously ‘narrative’ episode, like
the Yakùapra(cid:3)na discussed by Shulman. But what of didactic texts like
the n(cid:8)(cid:3)aüs(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)yaþ? Can they be judged in the same terms? Or are
the didactic corpora, as many scholars have suspected, just collations
of separate texts, each to be treated merely on its own terms?
(cid:3)
CHAPTER NINE
CODA:
TRANSITIONAL TEXTS OF THE (cid:4)PADDHARMAPARVAN II
This chapter unites together the last four texts of the (cid:2)DhP. These
texts continue the transitional function begun by those texts discussed
in the last chapter, a transition marking not just a shift from the the-
matic space of the (cid:2)DhP to the MDhP, but also a shift from the entire
royal instructions constituted in the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP taken collec-
tively to the instructions on the ‘laws of liberation’ that constitute the
MDhP. This broader context in which there is a general division be-
tween instructions on ruling and instructions on liberation accounts, I
suggest, for the large number of texts apparently devoted to this transi-
tion. The relative prominence of the Mbh’s inner frame in these four
texts emphasises their transitional position, with Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana’s
presence explicitly felt (having emerged once already in the previous
sequence of transitional texts1) in the last three of the four texts of this
sequence.2 In the first two of these cases, Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana introduces
new participants in the (cid:2)DhP’s most prominent interlocutory frame,
normally dominated only by Bh(cid:8)ùma and Yudhiùñhira. These varia-
tions in frame interlocution, and their significance for the transitional
positions of these units, are discussed further below.
The transitional texts discussed in this chapter part with those ex-
plored in the previous chapter on formal grounds, a formal distinct-
iveness matched by their quite separate transitional functions. The first
of these units offers a long and idiosyncratic exposition of penance,
the purificatory practices advocated not only for crimes, but also for
the sorts of breaking of normative rules that typifies a time of crisis.
The second and third units form a kind of pair. The former reworks an
important mythologem figuring the foundational significance of royal
power that, in its recurrence on three separate occasions through their
royal instructions, frames the texts of the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP sequence.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1 See above pp.346f. Cf. pp.166f. above.
2 See 160.1, 161.1 and 167.24 in units 26, 27 and 28. In the latter case, Vai(cid:5)aü-
p(cid:3)yana delivers the final stanza of the (cid:2)DhP.
360 CHAPTER NINE
The latter, on the other hand, while glancing back at the instructions
that have just passed, looks forward to those that are coming in the
near future, namely the instructions constituting the MDhP. Finally, in
revisiting a number of themes that weave through the (cid:2)DhP, the last
text offers a cautionary tale that, among other things, points to limits
in the application of (cid:2)paddharma.
9.1 ‘Concerning penance’ (Mbh 12.159; SU 25)
This unit is distinguished by its strongly dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stric character,
which is no more obvious than in its close relationship to the MS.
There is no pra(cid:3)na framing this text’s contents and Bh(cid:8)ùma begins
quite abruptly. The paucity of the text’s frame, and its consequent lack
of rhetorical integration in the (cid:2)DhP, suggests its secondary character.
Unlike an earlier sequence of units lacking pra(cid:3)nas, SUs 4-8, each of
which can be readily understood as foreshadowed in the pra(cid:3)nas fram-
ing SUs 1-3,3 the absence of a pra(cid:3)na in the present text is disconcert-
ing, emphasising again the important integrative function the pra(cid:3)na
plays in the didactic corpora of the Mbh. This is not to say, however,
that the contents of this text do not have some thematic continuity
with other material in the (cid:2)DhP that can help us make some sense of
its inclusion. Some suggestions in this direction will be made towards
the end of this discussion.
This text has many passages parallel to other dharma-s(cid:6)tras and
-(cid:3)(cid:2)stras, most especially the MS, as outlined in the table in FIGURE
14. This table uses the symbols =, (cid:3) and ~ to indicate the declining
degree of the relationship the stanzas of (cid:2)DhP 159 have with stanzas
from these other texts. In all cases I have attempted to give preference
to verbal parallels rather than just semantic similarities, though these
have been included too in the cases that they have been located. In
view of the need for economy, sometimes the = symbol is used even
in the case that there is a variant reading (some of these variants are
noted). Much of the data for this table has been gleaned from B(cid:10)hler’s
translation of the MS in which he collated an enormous number of
parallels between the MS and the Mbh and the other dharma texts.4
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
3 See above p.224. In the CE, units 16-17 are also without pra(cid:3)nas, a problem re-
lieved in some manuscript by the insertion of a pra(cid:3)na (see above pp.247f).
4 B(cid:10)hler, The Laws of Manu, pp.533-82.
CODA 361
The putative topic of this text is pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta,5 expiatory penances
that purify people from the consequences of their sins, though the first
penance does not appear until stanza 26. Stanzas 1-23 discuss various
topics which have little to do with pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta per se, as indicated in
FIGURE 14. These stanzas have a very close relationship to MS 11.1-
43; indeed, as a block, they represent the closest point of contact be-
tween the two texts.6 It is a curious fact that the most consistent se-
quence of parallel passages between the (cid:2)DhP’s chapter on pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)-
citta and the MS’s chapter on pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta does not concern penance at
all. In regard to the MS, both B(cid:10)hler and Olivelle have suggested that
this passage is somewhat anomalous. Olivelle is convinced that the
sequence is the result of the activity of later redactors responsible for
much of what he sees as secondary material in the MS.7 B(cid:10)hler, on the
other hand, considered the inclusion of this material in chapter 11 to
be a result of the refashioning of an hypothesised earlier M(cid:2)nava
Dharmas(cid:6)tra into the metrical MS.8 He notes that the GDhS includes
a similar discussion (18.24-32; see FIGURE 14) just prior to its section
on pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta, and therefore concludes it is likely that, in the process
of the MS’s recasting, two separate sections of the original work were
“welded together into one Adhy(cid:3)ya”.9 The secondary nature of this
sequence in Manu appears to be textually supported as well, since the
final stanza of chapter ten introduces the next topic as pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta, and
one would therefore expect the text to resume with this theme at the
beginning of chapter 11.10
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
5 For an overview of pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta, see Day, The Conception, esp. pp.211-40; Kane,
HDh(cid:7), vol.4, pp.1-178.
6 In regard to the stanzas in common between the two texts, B(cid:10)hler’s comments in
Laws of Manu (p.lxxxi) still hold: “Where larger sections agree, it is rare that more
than half-a-dozen verses stand in the same order in both works, and it happens not
rarely that a series of identical (cid:5)lokas is interrupted by the expansion of one verse into
two, or by a contraction of two into one.” For B(cid:10)hler’s comparison of (cid:2)DhP 159 and
MS 11, see Laws of Manu, pp.lxxxif.
7 Olivelle, “Structure,” pp.567f.; Manu’s Code of Law, p.59.
8 B(cid:10)hler, The Laws of Manu, pp.xviiiff. (following Max M(cid:10)ller). Olivelle has some
serious doubts about the notion of the present MS being a recasting of a M(cid:2)nava
Dharmas(cid:6)tra (“Structure,” pp.554, 560), though it has received some support else-
where (e.g. S. Jamison and M. Witzel, “Vedic Hinduism,”
www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/vedica.pdf 1992, p.22). Cf. Lingat, The Classi-
cal Law, p.90.

CODA 365
This is not the place to solve the problems of the text history of the
MS, nor of the chronological relationship of the MS and the Mbh. The
text of (cid:2)DhP 159 does, however, offer an opportunity to contribute
some preliminary observations to this rather complex picture. One
may note, for example, that the consistency of the parallelism in the
sequence of stanzas discussed above is not in keeping with the general
relationship between the two texts (the MS and (cid:2)DhP 159) for the
remainder of (cid:2)DhP 159. As the table in FIGURE 14 illustrates, the re-
mainder of this text (159.24-72), which specifically concerns pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)-
citta, generally exhibits a greater eclecticism and diversity in its paral-
lels with other texts, and not uncommonly shows a closer relationship
to dharma texts other than Manu. (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 stands apart, there-
fore, not just for its non-pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta themes, but also for its close rela-
tionship to a sequence of stanzas in the MS.
One could explain this state of affairs in a number of ways:11
a) (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 was adapted from MS 11.1-43;
b) all of (cid:2)DhP 159 was modelled on a number of dharma texts, but pri-
marily MS 11, and the closeness of (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 to MS 11.1-43
could be explained by the latter’s distinctiveness in the dharma-text
tradition;
c) MS 11.1-43 was adapted from (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 (remembering that
Olivelle considers the former to be a later addition to MS 11);
d) (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 was adapted from an earlier form of MS 11.1-43;
e) both texts were modelled on another, now lost predecessor.
B(cid:10)hler has already suggested something like the latter two positions to
account for the general relationship between the MS and the Mbh.12
Because the parallels between the two are subject to so many varia-
tions in stanza order and wording, he concludes that the “author or
authors of the first, twelfth, and thirteenth Parvans of the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata
knew a M(cid:3)nava Dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stra which was closely connected, but not
identical with the existing text”, and later states his inclination “to as-
sume that the author or authors of the Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata knew only the
Dharma-s(cid:4)tra”.13 While it is difficult to attribute the relationship be-
tween the texts to an earlier M(cid:2)navadharmas(cid:6)tra without there being
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
11 The list is suggestive rather than exhaustive.
12 Cf. Olivelle, Manu’s Code of Law, pp.23f.
13 Laws, pp.lxxix. and xcviii respectively.
366 CHAPTER NINE
firm evidence for the existence of such a text, the possibility that both
the sequences (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 and MS 11.143 are derivative of a
common source, or that (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 is derivative of an earlier ver-
sion of the MS, may have merit. However, it cannot be conclusively
ruled out that MS 11.1-43 is an expansion of (cid:2)DhP 11.1-23, though I
do not think this can be the case for the remainder of MS 11 and its
relationship to (cid:2)DhP 159.
If closer attention is paid especially to the parallel passages (cid:2)DhP
159.6-13 and MS 11.11-22, some interesting details emerge which
may shed light on the history of these texts and which rule out, I be-
lieve, options a) and b) above. These two sequences, which concern
the legitimate seizure of wealth in the case that a rite remains incom-
plete due to the lack of necessary resources, are especially close to
each other; indeed, (cid:2)DhP 159.6-9, 11-12b and 12c-13d are virtually
identical to MS 11.11-14, 16-17 and 21 and 22cd respectively. How-
ever, stanzas MS 11.18-20 have no parallel in (cid:2)DhP 159, and B(cid:10)hler
does not list any parallel passage from any other dharma text, and my
searches in these texts have also come up empty handed. But parallels
are found in another text of the (cid:2)DhP: (cid:2)DhP 134.2ab is a variant of
MS 11.20ab, 134.2cd of 11.18cd and 134.7 of 11.19 (see above page
241). Close inspection of MS 11.18-20 reveals that they are a slightly
awkward fit in the passage in which they occur. Though they are the-
matically related, they make perfect sense as stand alone stanzas,
unlike surrounding stanzas which form sequences (11.16-17 and 21-
23). In addition MS 11.21 seems to continue on from 11.17.14 Confir-
mation of their secondary nature is found in the parallel passage in
GDhS 18.24-32, which shows the same formulation (with due al-
lowance for their s(cid:6)tra form) as the (cid:2)DhP sequence. The (cid:2)DhP se-
quence, therefore, would seem to reflect an earlier form of this se-
quence of stanzas. Consequently, even given the limited scope of this
analysis, we can not assume that (cid:2)DhP 159.1-23 is an adaptation of
MS 11.1-43 in its present form, ruling out options a) and b) above.
The remainder of the unit (159.24-72) is concerned with sins and
their corresponding pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)cittas. There is a vague structure evident in
some of these stanzas, especially in the introduction of the mah(cid:2)-
p(cid:2)taka sins in 159.32-6. Firstly, those expiations involving the loss of
the sinner’s life are introduced in 32, and then those that can be expi-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
14 Olivelle, Manu’s Code of Law, p.339 note to 11.21.
CODA 367
ated while remaining alive in 159.33-6. A number of passages dealing
with ancillary issues follow, such as how to behave towards the
‘fallen’ (those who have sinned) in 159.37-8 and false accusation in
159.39, before a more expansive discussion of the mah(cid:2)p(cid:2)takas re-
sumes in 150.41-50, this time along with their expiations. This struc-
ture mirrors, on a much smaller scale, the structure of the discussion
of penances in MS 11.15 The remaining stanzas concern a mixed bag
of sins and their penances, of generally lesser severity than the mah(cid:2)-
p(cid:2)takas, which appear for the most part to form a miscellaneous col-
lection without a strict principle of organisation.
As already stated, unlike the earlier verses of this chapter, stanzas
159.24-72 show a more complicated and eclectic pattern of relation-
ships with other dharma texts, though the MS still figures promi-
nently, if less systematically than has been the case thus far. The vary-
ing degrees of parallel relationships that can be established with verses
and s(cid:6)tras from the dharmas(cid:6)tras, and the assumption that these texts
are almost certainly earlier than the didactic corpora of the Mbh,
clearly suggest that the redactor had more than one predecessor in
view. For example, (cid:2)DhP 159.24-7, a section devoted to (cid:5)(cid:4)drification
and associating with (cid:5)(cid:4)dras (it hardly needs mentioning that its subject
is a br(cid:3)hman), combines an almost exact replica of the anuùñubh in
BDhS 2.6.32 (159.25), with a variation of an anuùñubh found at (cid:2)DhS
1.27.10 (159.26) and another variation of a triùñubh found at (cid:2)DhS
1.27.11 (159.27). To further complicate matters, the latter in some
ways demonstrates a closer relationship to BDhS 2.2.10-11 (11 is,
again, a triùñubh). Curiously, a similar stanza to 159.27 (and its paral-
lels) occurs at MS 11.178 (=ViS 53.9), but the redactor of the (cid:2)DhP
clearly either preferred other sources than Manu in this instance, or
did not have the extant Manu in view at all.16 There are other instances
in which this SU shows an especially close relationship to a dharma-
s(cid:6)tra (see the table in FIGURE 14): (cid:2)DhP 159.32-5, which recounts
the mah(cid:2)p(cid:2)takas, has much in common with VDhS 1.19-22 and ViS
35.1-5;17 (cid:2)DhP 159.48-50, concerning brahmahaty(cid:2), shows some
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
15 See Olivelle, “Structure,” pp.547f.
16 Note that Olivelle (“Stucture,” pp.548, 568) considers MS 11.178 (179 in his
enumeration) to be part of a sequence (11.126-78 [127-79]) attributable to later redac-
torial activity.
17 As the table in FIGURE 14 indicates, 159.35, which concerns associating with
outcastes, is a common stanza found in numerous texts.
368 CHAPTER NINE
marked similarities to the s(cid:6)tras in BDhS 2.1.2-5 and GDhS 22.4-10;
the stanza concerning adultery and theft in (cid:2)DhP 159.55 closely re-
sembles the s(cid:6)tras at GDhS 22.28-30; and the penance for a br(cid:3)hman
who has drunk soma smelling alcohol on a br(cid:3)hman in 159.71c-f is a
variant of the verse in VDhS 21.21 (where, however, it is called the
‘hot arduous penance’ (taptak(cid:8)cchra) and is given for a man who kills
a cow) and closely resembles the s(cid:6)tra at ViS 46.11, a penance this
text elsewhere allocates for numerous offences.18 Lastly, the broader
structure of (cid:2)DhP 159.48-53, stanzas unified through their concern
with killing (with the exception of 159.51, on which, however, see
below), appears to reflect a tendency in the dharmas(cid:6)tras to group
these topics closely together, as evident especially in GDhS 22.7-19,
and to a lesser extent in (cid:2)DhS, and to a lesser extent again in VDhS
(see FIGURE 14). It is worth noting that Olivelle considers the MS par-
allels (11.127-30) to some of the stanzas in this sequence to be, once
again, the result of later redactorial activity.19
This text frequently combines sin and penance in a way that might
be considered unusual in comparison with similar examples from
other texts, and sometimes a sin and its penance can be shown to each
have different textual parallels in other sources. It appears, therefore,
that this is largely an idiosyncratic text within the tradition of dharma
texts dealing with penances, even if this tradition’s treatment of pen-
ance is far from homogeneous. Take the example of the above dis-
cussed 159.71. The transgression given in 159.71ab is ‘a somapa
(someone entitled to offer a sacrifice) smelling the odour of a drunk
br(cid:3)hman’ (br(cid:2)hmaõasya sur(cid:2)pasya gandham (cid:2)ghr(cid:2)ya somapaþ). MS
11.149ab has the exact same transgression with a slight variant read-
ing (br(cid:2)hmaõas tu…; a reading also followed by a number of (cid:2)DhP
manuscripts), and it is also found in GDhS 23.6 and ViS 51.25 (the
latter is especially close to the MS and (cid:2)DhP). Each of these dharma
texts provides two avenues for expiating this transgression, a variation
of breath control (or chanting in the case of ViS)20 and eating ghee.
(cid:2)DhP 159.81c-f, however, gives drinking hot water, hot milk, hot
ghee and living on air, each for three days. As already discussed, this
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
18 See e.g. ViS 22.58, 40.2, 41.5, 51.27, 54.17.
19 See p.367 n.16 above.
20 GDhS ‘the breath exercises’ (pr(cid:2)õ(cid:2)y(cid:2)ma); ViS ‘plunging into water while mut-
tering the Aghamarùana three times’ (udakamagnas trir aghamarùaü jatpv(cid:2)); MS
‘suppressing the breath three times in water’ (pr(cid:2)n(cid:2)n apsu trir(cid:2)yamya).
CODA 369
penance is a variant of VDhS 21.21, where it is called the tapta-
k(cid:8)cchra penance and is given for killing a cow. This penance is, in
fact, fairly common in the dharma texts,21 and while the transgressions
it addresses vary, the (cid:2)DhP stands alone in offering it for smelling the
breath of someone who has drunk alcohol.22 While the apparent adapt-
ability of this penance might explain its unique usage in the (cid:2)DhP, it
is more difficult to explain the variation in penance for the particular
transgression that it expiates, since the penance for smelling a
sur(cid:2)pa’s breath seems relatively stable in the tradition.
There are further examples of this text’s idiosyncratic combination
of sin and penance (for detailed textual references see FIGURE 14).
Stanzas 159.51 and 52, which respectively concern a drinker of sur(cid:2)
(an alcoholic beverage) and the murderer of a vai(cid:5)ya and (cid:5)(cid:4)dra,
clearly relate to the sequence of kùatriya-, vai(cid:5)ya- and (cid:5)(cid:4)dra-killer as
presented in the dharma texts. The (cid:2)DhP has merely replaced the kil-
ler of a kùatriya (r(cid:2)janya in some texts) with sur(cid:2)pa. Stanza 159.56
concerns the transgression of extinguishing the sacred fires (agn(cid:5)n
apa+(cid:2)vyadh in 56ef) and has a direct parallel in MS 11.41 and VDhS
21.27, each of which gives a different penance.23 The penance in the
(cid:2)DhP (159.56a-d) appears to be a variation of a penance found in the
triùñubhs at (cid:2)DhS 1.25.10, where it addresses the crimes of theft,
sur(cid:2)pa and copulating with an elder’s wife, and (cid:2)DhS 1.27.10 and
BDhS 2.2.10, where it addresses the crimes of serving or associating
with (cid:5)(cid:4)dras. While the penances in these texts are more severe (in
keeping with the severity of the sins), lasting for three years rather
than the three days of the (cid:2)DhP penance, the similarity of other fea-
tures in each penance would seem to warrant their close association. A
somewhat similar penance is also found at MS 11.224, where it has
general applicability. Stanzas 159.66-8 concern the sin of bestiality
(with an animal other than a cow) and have a reasonably close coun-
terpart in GDhS 22.36 and MS 11.173. The latter prescribes the s(cid:2)ü-
tapana k(cid:8)cchra penance, while the former the offering of ghee into a
fire while reciting the k(cid:6)ùm(cid:2)õóa verses. In 159.67-8, however, the
(cid:2)DhP prescribes the penance usually reserved for someone (typically
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
21 See FIGURE 14 and Kane, HDh(cid:7), vol.4, pp.138-9.
22 The closest would be GDhS 23.2, which gives it for a sur(cid:2)pa.
23 MS 11.41 prescribes performance of the ‘lunar penance’ (c(cid:2)ndr(cid:2)yaõa) for a
month; VDhS 21.27 prescribes the k(cid:8)cchra penance for twelve nights and then the
reassembly of the fires.
370 CHAPTER NINE
a brahmac(cid:2)rin) who has violated his vow of chastity, as in GDhS
23.18-19, ViS 28.49 and MS 11.122,24 not for violating his chastity
specifically with an animal.
Why, then, is a text that seems rather secondarily constituted in the
(cid:2)DhP, and which in many ways seems idiosyncratic when compared
to other members of its genre, included in the (cid:2)DhP at all? For an an-
swer to this question, one must look to the transformative power at-
tributed to penances, and the transitional position of this unit at the
end of the (cid:2)DhP and the beginning of the MDhP.
Some texts in the (cid:2)DhP have already indicated the necessity of
performing penance once a period of (cid:2)paddharma has passed, as in
the case of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra in 139.91. Similarly, in SU 15 Janamejaya was
instructed to perform an a(cid:3)vamedha as penance for his (accidental)
brahminicide, which, I argued, offers a more general model for the
absolution of the sins a king accrues in the course of his rule.25 An-
other striking example of penance is found earlier in the (cid:6)P. As the
table in FIGURE 14 illustrates, a number of loose parallels to some
stanzas in (cid:2)DhP 159 are found in (cid:6)P 34-6. These chapters are part of
a broader set of speeches concerning expiation delivered by Vy(cid:3)sa in
chapters 32-7,26 which follow on from the grieving of Yudhiùñhira, his
expressions of guilt at the destruction of the war, and his brothers’,
friends’ and advisors’ attempts to alleviate his suffering.27 Just as (cid:6)au-
naka recommended to Janamejaya in SU 15, Vy(cid:3)sa suggests Yudhi-
ùñhira alleviate his sense of shame and ensure his place in the ‘next
world’ by undertaking pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta through the performance of an
a(cid:3)vamedha.28 Despite Yudhiùñhira’s own feeling that his sin is ‘with-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
24 A more extreme version of this penance is often prescribed for brahmahaty(cid:2), as
in (cid:2)DhP 159.49, (cid:2)DhS 1.24.15, BDhS 2.1.3 and GDhS 22.4. (cid:2)DhS 1.28.49 offers a
variation of this for a man who has unjustly abandoned his wife.
25 See above p.315.
26 On this passage see also Hiltebeitel, The Ritual, pp.291f.
27 See above pp.135ff.
28 (cid:6)P 32.23-4. Hiltebeitel notes (The Ritual, p.292) that in the Mbh the a(cid:3)vamedha
becomes “associated almost exclusively with expiation”, an association evident al-
ready in the late br(cid:2)hmaõa period (e.g. (cid:6)B 13.5.4.1-3). See also his suggestive com-

out end’ (anantaka, i.e. inexpiable),29 Vy(cid:3)sa assures him that since he
sinned ‘without wanting to’ (aniccham(cid:2)na), he was eligible for expia-
tion.30 Yudhiùñhira performs the a(cid:3)vamedha in book 14 of the Mbh,31
after which, ‘free of evil’ (vip(cid:2)pm(cid:2)), he enters his city (14.91.41).
With the introduction of the theme of pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta in the (cid:6)P, Yudhi-
ùñhira asks to hear more, and so in the next three chapters (35-7)
Vy(cid:3)sa expounds at length on a miscellaneous collection of sins and
penances, from which the above mentioned parallels are drawn. Two
points ought to be emphasised: firstly, that Yudhiùñhira was encour-
aged to perform expiation in order to redress the wrongs he committed
in the name of recovering his kingdom, despite the general perception
of the other characters that the war was just; secondly, that after per-
forming his penance, he was cleansed of his sin and made ready for
heaven.
Conceptually, (cid:2)paddharma functions to give some normative sanc-
tion to abnormal conduct, whether this is conceived in terms of the
restrictions dharma places on the individual, or in terms of political
expediency. Yet, conduct necessary or excusable an account of ardu-
ous circumstances is still tainted by the nature of that conduct. With-
out a penance to remove that taint, the individual will suffer the con-
sequences of his actions, despite the apologetic claims of (cid:2)pad-
dharma. At least theoretically, this is well established in the practical
deeds of people. In the narratives of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra in SU 12, of Janame-
jaya’s brahminicide in SU 15, and of Yudhiùñhira’s undertaking of the
a(cid:3)vamedha, there is a logical progression from the performance of a
problematic deed, to concern for the sinful nature of that deed, to the
expiation of the taint the sin leaves behind. In the process, the individ-
ual is transformed from a dangerous state of sin, to a state of purified
normality. The (cid:2)DhP contains a textual analogue of this structure,
since SU 25 syntactically follows a body of texts on (cid:2)paddharma. The

29 (cid:6)P 33.11. This would be even worse than the idea reflected in (cid:2)DhP 159.32,
that some sins can only expiated with the ‘end of one’s life’ (pr(cid:2)n(cid:2)nta).
30 (cid:6)P 34.25. The same principle underpins SU 15, in which Janamejaya commits
brahminicide ‘accidentally’ (abuddhip(cid:6)rva); the division between intentional and
unintentional sins is common in the sm(cid:8)ti literature. See Day, The Conception,
pp.214ff. and above p.306 n.34.

MS also has a similar structure, with its pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta chapter following
its (cid:2)paddharma chapter. The two texts share something else in com-
mon too. While in the (cid:6)P the MDhP follows the (cid:2)DhP, after the chap-
ter on pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta in the MS there is a chapter concering karma, yoga,
the fruits of actions and the way to the supreme good, i.e., a chapter
whose thematic concerns might be considered analogous to the
MDhP. It seems that in the transitional position of their pr(cid:2)ya(cid:3)citta
sections, therefore, the syntactic structure of these texts replicate an
individual’s transformation as he moves from a state of sin through
penance to a state of purified normality, and thereby is prepared for
the pursuit of salvation.
9.2 ‘The origin of the sword’ (Mbh 12.160; SU 26)
Unit 26 begins with a surprising change in interlocutor. In the first
stanza the interlocutory frame recedes one level and Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana
introduces a new participant in the ongoing conversation of the (cid:6)P.
Having approached during the ‘course of the conversation’ (kath(cid:2)n-
tara), Nakula, ‘skilled in battle with a sword’ (khaógayuddha-
vi(cid:3)(cid:2)rada), says to Bh(cid:8)ùma who, we are reminded, is ‘lying on a bed of
arrows’ ((cid:3)aratalpastha): ‘It is said, grandfather, that the bow is the
best weapon, but, law-knower, I think a very sharp sword [is best].’32
Nakula offers a brief argument to this effect, before he asks Bh(cid:8)ùma
(160.5cd-6): ‘what do you think is the best weapon in all battles? How
was the sword produced, for what purpose, and by whom? And tell me
about the first master of the sword.’ Bh(cid:8)ùma’s response to these ques-
tions forms the body of this unit and incorporates a cosmogonic myth,
a vaü(cid:3)a list, a myth of destruction evoking the pralaya, symbolic rep-
resentations of authority and the daõóa, the complementary functions
of the trim(cid:6)rti and a eulogy of the sword. That this account of the
‘Origin of the Sword’ is prompted by a question from Nakula, a bit
player at best in the (cid:6)P, as in the Mbh in general, is at first sight an
odd feature and demands some explanation. We will return to this
question after our account of the main portion of the narrative.

CODA 373
This narrative belongs to a mythologem in which Brahm(cid:3) takes a
central role in resurrecting the order of the world after a period of dis-
order. Typically, this involves the creation of some kind of coercive
force to reinstate order, such as the institution of kingship (as in RDhP
59), or an instrument of that institution (as here).33 Some versions of
this mythologem involve P(cid:7)thu as the first king, sometimes in associa-
tion with the bow (dhanu).34 In an interesting instance of mythic inter-
textuality, this text is aware of, and maybe designed as a contrast to,
the P(cid:7)thu myth. The text first hints at this when Nakula begins his
query by citing the anonymous view that ‘the bow is the best weapon’,
against which he posits the question of the merits of the sword. It is
towards the end of the text, however, that Bh(cid:8)ùma more firmly estab-
lishes the P(cid:7)thu/bow connection: ‘P(cid:7)thu brought forth the first bow
and with it the son of Vena protected the earth in the past.’35 While the
relationship of this to its surrounding text is not entirely transparent,
when taken with Nakula’s opening statement it appears to testify to
some kind of change having occurred where the sword has overtaken
the bow as the chief symbol of royal power, if not the primary weapon
of the armed forces. If it is the case that this reflects real historical
change,36 though the evidence is, at best, flimsy, then the version of
the myth being related in this unit might be viewed as an ‘update’ of
its underlying mythologem in accordance with the material culture of
its time. On the other hand, in terms of the Mbh narrative, it might be
viewed in light of the beginning of a new era; with the earth now
cleansed of the forces of adharma, and with the P(cid:3)õóavas’ ascension
to their throne, a new symbol of power heralds the beginning of a new

just age. Whatever the case, it is important to note, as discussed
above,37 that different versions of the underlying mythologem tend to
occur at or near junctions in the narration of the royal instructions of
the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence, and hence provide a mythic frame to these
instructions that reinforces both the necessity for righteous kings and
the symbiosis of kingship and force.
The version of the mythologem presented in this unit places the
creation of the coercive force within a cosmogonic framework (see the
summary in FIGURE 15). Once Brahm(cid:3) created this ‘emanation of be-
ings’ (bh(cid:6)tasarga) and ‘again joined’ (yuyuje punaþ) to it the dharma
‘as mentioned in the veda’ (vedapañhita),38 the enmity between the
gods and demons leads inevitably to the creation of the sword. While
the gods, along with the ‘teachers and priests’, various semi-divine
beings and sages, lived devoted to dharma, obeying Brahm(cid:3)’s com-
mands (160.22-5), the d(cid:2)nava and daitya demons were violating the
‘limits of the law’ (dharmasetu) and devoted to adharma.39 They were
‘competing with the gods and sages’ (spardham(cid:2)n(cid:2)þ surarùibhiþ),
considering themselves their equal (160.29). The demons’ corruption
of the proper order of things, as laid down by Brahm(cid:3) in the creation
of the triple world, is the necessary precondition for the creation of the
sword. This corruption gains further symbolic loading through the
demons’ oppression ((cid:2)rudh) of creatures with the daõóa, the ‘rod of
punishment’ (160.30), the symbol of royal authority which clearly has
an interchangeable symbolic relationship with ‘the sword’; a relation-
ship which, we shall soon see, is indeed drawn upon by the myth it-
self.
In keeping with the typical plot of the underlying mythologem, the
Brahmarùis approached Brahm(cid:3) who lived on Himavat (160.31), pre-
sumably to ask for his intervention, though, oddly, this is not stated.
After a thousand years, Brahm(cid:3) performed a sacrifice ‘in accordance
with the kalpa(-s(cid:6)tras)’ (160.33-4). From the sacrifice a terrifying
‘being’ (bh(cid:6)ta) was produced that was ‘tall and difficult to look at’
(pr(cid:2)ü(cid:3)u durdar(cid:3)ana) and had a ‘colour like a blue lotus, sharp teeth
and a thin waist’ (n(cid:5)lotpalasavarõ(cid:2)bhaü t(cid:5)kùõadaüùñraü k(cid:8)(cid:3)oda-

dressed the Maharùis, gods (suras) and gandharvas, naming this being
(bh(cid:6)ta) asi, ‘sword’, which he ‘thought up’ (cintita) ‘for the protection
of the world and the destruction of the enemies of the gods’ (rakùaõ(cid:2)-
rth(cid:2)ya lokasya vadh(cid:2)ya ca suradviù(cid:2)m).41 Brahm(cid:3) then gave the
sword to ‘dark-throated’ ((cid:3)itikaõñha) Rudra in order that he prevent
adharma (160.44). Rudra assumed his ferocious form (160.45-8) and,
as the demons desperately attacked him (160.51-2), he moved among
them, ‘chopping, cleaving, shattering, tearing, scattering and laying
waste’ (chindan bhindan rujan k(cid:8)ntan d(cid:2)rayan pramathann api).42
The demons were destroyed and the earth shone forth, even while it
was covered with slaughtered demon bodies, the ground thick with
their blood.
Pralaya imagery abounds in this episode (in 160.43 the sword was
already described as k(cid:2)l(cid:2)ntaka) as Rudra/(cid:6)iva fulfils his role in the
trim(cid:6)rti as the destroyer, so that dharma can be reasserted as the nor-

tion here recapitulates the war. Cross-references between the deva/
asura and P(cid:3)õóava/Kaurava conflicts frequently occur in the Mbh.
There are two distinct elements to these cross-references. On the one
hand, the Mbh war between the Kauravas and P(cid:3)õóavas is seen as a
transposition of the eternal conflict between asuras and devas, with
the epic heroes incarnating each side respectively.44 On the other hand,
the conflict between the gods and demons provides a framework
through which the epic heroes can understand and justify the war. An
example of the latter is found in Mbh 3.34.58, when Bh(cid:8)ma tries to
convince Yudhiùñhira that they should go to war rather than into exile.
Exhorting him to use deceit (nik(cid:8)ti) to defeat the Kauravas, Bh(cid:8)ma
points to the example of the devas who used comparable means to de-
feat the asuras. Similarly, once the war is over, K(cid:7)ùõa excuses the de-
ceptions involved in the deaths of the Kaurava generals, since ‘this
path was previously followed by the gods who slayed the asuras’
(p(cid:6)rvair anugato m(cid:2)rgo devair asuragh(cid:2)tibhiþ),45 and in almost the
exact same words in the (cid:6)P Vy(cid:3)sa consoles a morose Yudhiùñhira.46
Yet, when viewed from the point of view of the ongoing narrative of
the Mbh, the narration of the deva/asura conflict allegorically reca-
pitulates the destruction of the Bh(cid:3)rata war. In so doing, the events of
the great war are revisited in light of the r(cid:2)jadharma instructions; we
are reminded of the participation of its interlocutors in the tragic
drama of that episode (note also the reiteration of Bh(cid:8)ùma’s supine
condition, which performs a similar function), and of the broader con-
text of the teaching delivered thus far in the (cid:6)P. The war is not merely
given a veneer of justification by the narration of an esteemed exem-
plar, but a model is provided for the subsequent assumption of the
duty to protect the earth and dharma.
Once Brahm(cid:3) has performed his role as creator and Rudra his as
destroyer, Viùõu then assumes his role as the preserver. Just as
Brahm(cid:3) passed the sword to him, Rudra now passes the sword to
Viùõu, thereby beginning the line of descent (vaü(cid:3)a, parampar(cid:2)) of

this ultimate instrument of order that ends with the P(cid:3)õóavas, as illus-
trated in FIGURE 16. As Fitzgerald has noted, this list has some pecu-
liar features.47 Obviously it does not represent a lineage of patrilineal
descent; while some of its members are clearly descended from their
predecessor in the list (e.g. Manu-Kùupa-Ikùv(cid:3)ku; Pur(cid:4)ravas-(cid:2)yus-
Nahuùa-Yay(cid:3)ti-P(cid:4)ru), others are not (Bh(cid:4)mi(cid:5)aya-Bharata-Aióibióa).
F.E. Pargiter disparages this list as a useful historical source because it
confuses the order of some names; and, as far as it goes, he is proba-
bly right.48 It is unlikely that this is the point of a list such as this,
however, and we should look rather to its function in establishing dy-
nastic ‘links’.49 One may note, for example, its rather inclusive nature.
Ikùv(cid:3)ku, the founder of the solar dynasty (from whom the heroes of
the R(cid:2)m(cid:2)yaõa descend), hands the sword on to his nephew Pur(cid:4)ravas,
the founder of the lunar dynasty (from whom the heroes of the Mbh
descend). This alternation between dynasties recurs throughout the
list. There are also representatives of different lineage branches, thus
the Bhojas and Y(cid:3)davas and the Pauravas (descendents of P(cid:4)ru) are
separate branches of the lunar dynasty. Similarly, different regions are
represented: the lunar dynasty focuses on ‘Madhyade(cid:5)a’ in the west-
ern Gaïg(cid:3) basin, with branches in outlying areas (Bhojas/Y(cid:3)davas),
the solar dynasty is located in the middle Gaïg(cid:3) basin,50 and K(cid:3)mboja
is from the north-west. It seems likely, therefore, that the point of the
list is not found in its historical validity as a lineage as such that ex-
isted at some time and in some place. The inheritors of the sword are
bequeathed a tradition of royal discipline marked by the exemplary
quality of those individuals who tradition remembers have borne the
sword, thereby legitimating by association their use of coercive force.
Whatever the connection of this list to the realia of history, its most
significant factor is its representation of the descent of royal authority
from divine figures, to human figures of legendary proportions
(Manu), until we arrive at the (quasi-) historical personages of the
epic. Manu, the son of the sun, considered the father of all humankind
and ultimate progenitor of both the lunar and solar dynasties,51 situates

a significant transition in the list marked with a short interlude of four
stanzas (160.67-70). As the divine Lokap(cid:3)las give Manu the sword,
they declare ‘you are now the lord of men, you must protect the crea-
tures with the sword, the womb of dharma’.52 And so it is for all those
(men) who subsequently possess the sword.
It is of some significance, however, that with the transmission of
the sword to the ‘human’ level, there are three stanzas that establish
limits to its appropriate use. Some of these stanzas echo others in
RDhP 122, a chapter that relates the origin of the daõóa and shares the
same underlying mythologem as the text being discussed here,53 and
which also depicts the transition of the daõóa from the divine to the
human level. The symbolic and functional equivalence between the
daõóa and the sword is quite clear.54 Stanza 160.69 clearly establishes
the metonymic relationship that exists between ‘punishment’ and
‘sword’, just as ‘daõóa’, ‘sceptre’, ‘sword’, ‘punishment’, ‘royal au-
thority’, the army, the king and so on, all stand in relationships of me-

tonymy and metaphor to each other. As Glucklich has pointed out in
his broad study of the usage of daõóa across its various semantic do-
mains, “daõóa is first and foremost the royal scepter”, and “the poly-
valence and semantic richness of the symbol impregnates the scepter
with themes of fecundity, prosperity, and productivity, along with
power, violence, and death”.55 It is precisely because the daõóa/sword
evokes such a range of associations that it is always accompanied with
some ambivalence, as even here in a text designed to eulogise it. Just
as the sword/daõóa is the principal means of asserting and maintain-
ing dharma (as demonstrated by Rudra and Viùõu respectively), of
keeping the various dharmas separated, it is also the same tool that
can bring about the decline of dharma (as demonstrated by the de-
mons and Kauravas). As already noted above, it was precisely with
the daõóa that the demons oppressed the creatures (praj(cid:2)), leading to
the demons’ annihilation. Interceding the narration of this myth, there-
fore, are restrictions on the usage of the ‘sword’. With the transmis-
sion of the sword to the human level, its new bearers are expressly
urged to recognise limits to its use. Thus 160.68 (cf. 122.39cd, 40ab)
relates that after being punished, the perpetrator of the crime again
deserves protection; 160.68 describes a number of forms of punish-
ment, and the limits to their application (cf. 122.40cd, 41ab); and
160.69 then describes these punishments as ‘forms of the sword’ (aser
et(cid:2)ni r(cid:6)p(cid:2)õi), but adds the warning that they are the sword’s ‘stan-
dards’ (pram(cid:2)õa—one might say ‘limits’) because these ‘measures
can be transgressed’ (parim(cid:2)õavyatikram(cid:2)t).
Why, then, is it Nakula, of all the P(cid:3)õóavas, who prompts Bh(cid:8)ùma to
relate this narrative? As Stig Wikander has said, the twins (Nakula and
his brother Sahadeva) “enter on stage much less often than their eld-
ers, and no great exploits or decisive actions are attached to their
names. They hardly ever operate alone; they are always subordinated
to their brothers, and their greatest quality is that they punctually obey
their orders.”56 Nakula is a minor character and it seems odd at first
glance that he would take such a central role.57 But there are, in fact,

57 At (cid:6)P 12.2, as Nakula takes his turn in the debate against Yudhiùñhira, he is de-
scribed as ‘blushing, for he seldom spoke’ (t(cid:2)mr(cid:2)syo mitabh(cid:2)ùit(cid:2)).
380 CHAPTER NINE
two related reasons for this apparent anomaly. Firstly, while the P(cid:3)õ-
óava heroes use all manner of weapons, each, as Dumézil pointed out,
is associated with one weapon in particular.58 Of all weapons, the
twins, and especially Nakula, are closely associated with the sword.
During the P(cid:3)õóavas’ education with Droõa, the twins are described
as ts(cid:2)rukau, ‘skilful with the hilt of a sword’;59 when the P(cid:3)õóavas
depart after the first dicing match, Nakula is said to pick up his
‘sword’ (khaóga) and ‘shield’ (carma);60 and when the P(cid:3)õóavas at-
tack Jayadratha for having kidnapped Draupad(cid:8), Nakula leaps from his
chariot ‘wielding his sword’ (3.255.10). Emphasising the deliberate
nature of these associations, they emerge in contexts in which each
brother employs the weapon with which he is particularly identified
(e.g. Bh(cid:8)ma uses his club (gad(cid:2)), Arjuna his G(cid:3)õó(cid:8)va bow, etc.).61 A
second explanation is furnished by some of Nakula’s character traits
as explored by Wikander. He notes that, of the twins, Nakula is both
more aggressive and more closely associated with militarism and
war,62 an association further reflected in his close relationship with the
more war-like Bh(cid:8)ma (Sahadeva, on the other hand, has a close rela-
tionship with Yudhiùñhira).63 With these associations in mind, Yudhi-
ùñhira’s administrative appointments, made just prior to the beginning
of the r(cid:2)jadharma instructions delivered by Bh(cid:8)ùma, make perfect
sense (12.41.8-15). While Bh(cid:8)ma is appointed as yuvar(cid:2)ja, the ‘crown
prince’, Nakula is given the responsibility of being overseer of the
armed forces.64 Later, when Arjuna sets off to escort the horse in the
a(cid:3)vamedha, Bh(cid:8)ma and Nakula are assigned the responsibility of pro-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

Social and Military Position,” p.281) misses this when he says, “No one is noted es-
pecially for sword-skill.”
60 Mbh 2.66.14. While Dumézil also attributes this to Sahadeva, the CE only refers
to Nakula.
61 In the contemporary P(cid:3)õóav L(cid:8)l(cid:3) of Garhwal in Uttar Pradesh, the P(cid:3)õóavas are
still associated with particular weapons, among which Nakula is associated with the
“scythe” (Sax, “Who’s Who,” p.139) or “a herder’s stick or a grass cutting scythe”
(Sax, Dancing the Self, p.84).

tecting the kingdom (14.71.19, 25).65 Evidently, therefore, in terms of
both the narrative arc of the Mbh and Nakula’s underlying character
traits, it clearly makes sense for him to be Bh(cid:8)ùma’s interlocutor in
this dialogue. He not only has a close relationship to the sword as a
weapon, he also has special responsibilities in relation to the sword’s
various metonymic and metaphoric designata, such as ‘protection’ and
the ‘army’.
Nakula’s appearance, however, might have further significance as
well. The manipulation of the frame and its interlocutors, via the in-
tervention of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana, suggests the employment of a narrative
technique with a specific end in view. What might this end be? While
on the surface it makes perfect sense for Nakula to ask about the
sword, is there a deeper import behind his entrance into this narrative
of royal instructions? And what might be the specific import of the
placement of this narrative at the end of a formal period in royal in-
structions? Once again, the transitional position of this unit at the end
of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence is of undoubted significance. The P(cid:3)õ-
óavas’ receipt of the sword, narrated as a result of Nakula’s question,
is the narrative counterpart to the transformation the P(cid:3)õóavas have
undergone as a consequence of the n(cid:5)ti revelation imparted by
Bh(cid:8)ùma. Both the placing of the question in the mouth of the sword-
using Nakula, and the evocation of his post-war military role (an-
nounced, if briefly, just prior to the beginning of the r(cid:2)jadharma in-
structions) through the metonymy of ‘asi’, ‘daõóa’ and ‘army’, draws
the entire unit into the broader narrative framework of the Mbh. With
the completion of the royal instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence,
the narrative of the descent of the sword allegorises the maturing of
the P(cid:3)õóavas. Their formal royal education has prepared them for the
full assumption of their duties. Just as the sword descends from divin-
ity to those victorious humans who remain after the destruction of the
war, these heroic sons of P(cid:3)õóu, having accomplished this destruction
in the image of Rudra, are now prepared (k(cid:8)t(cid:2)tman, one might say) to
assume their proper duty, as keepers, in the image of Viùõu, of royal
authority in its coercive yet fecund function to maintain the earth and
the dharmas of its inhabitants.

382 CHAPTER NINE
9.3 ‘The song in six parts’ (Mbh 12.161; SU 27)
Unit 27 is a dialogue in six parts between Yudhiùñhira and his brothers
and Vidura. Like the previous unit, this text recedes one interlocutory
level and is introduced by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana. Bh(cid:8)ùma appears only briefly
in the first and last stanzas, and then only in the third person. The ap-
pearance of Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana in this SU and units 26 and 28 heightens
the sense of their transitional status. It might be useful, even, to con-
sider the two a pair, in as much as both involve participants usually
absent from the didactic corpora of the (cid:6)P, and both ‘look elsewhere’,
pointing its readers or audience to broader narrative frameworks oper-
ating in the (cid:6)P and the Mbh. In this sense, SU 26 can be considered to
‘look backwards’, since it provides a concluding point to the royal
instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence. We shall see, on the other
hand, that SU 27 ‘looks forward’, since it provides a smooth transition
from the worldly concerns of the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP to the general the-
matic space of the MDhP. The transformation the text of the (cid:6)P un-
dergoes to achieve this thematic shift is mirrored in the transformation
Yudhiùñhira and his companions have undergone in the course of their
formal instruction; and, it will be argued, this transformation is explic-
itly brought into the foreground by the contrast this text makes with
another multi-participant dialogue in the early chapters of the (cid:6)P, a
dialogue which deals with similar themes as the present text but which
has quite a different outcome.66
While the absence of Bh(cid:8)ùma as an interlocutor ruptures the typical
dialogic structure of the (cid:2)DhP, Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana provides a smooth
transition to its new, brief, multipart structure, by signaling that
Bh(cid:8)ùma has fallen into silence (161.1). Yudhiùñhira then takes his
brothers and Vidura aside and poses a series of questions (161.2-3):
dharme c(cid:2)rthe ca k(cid:2)me ca lokav(cid:8)ttiþ sam(cid:2)hit(cid:2)|
teù(cid:2)ü gar(cid:5)y(cid:2)n katamo madhyamaþ ko laghu(cid:3) ca kaþ||

People’s behaviour is directed towards dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma. Of
these, which is the most important? Which the middlemost? And which
the least important? And in which of these should a person be fixed for
victory over the set of three? Content as you are, please duly speak a
decisive speech.
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
66 See further, A. Bowles, “Framing Bh(cid:8)ùma’s royal instructions.”
CODA 383
The puruù(cid:2)rthas, ‘goals of man’, dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma, ‘law’,
‘prosperity’ and ‘desire’, provide the structure for the ensuing dia-
logue. Yet, it is a fourth category, mokùa ‘liberation’, that is its true
subject and, fittingly, it is Yudhiùñhira who establishes its pre-emi-
nence in the final speech of the dialogue. The trivarga lays the con-
ceptual groundwork for the introduction of mokùa, and the transition
in this unit from the trivarga to mokùa (which together form the catur-
varga) mirrors the transition from the worldly instructions of the
RDhP and (cid:2)DhP to the MDhP. Each participant in the dialogue out-
lines the relationship of these categories to each other. Frequently, this
takes the form of asserting the superiority of one over the others. This
is probably the sense behind trivargavijaya in 161.3b (see the above
citation),67 which implies that mastery in whichever category is supe-
rior allows one to gain the full benefit of the others; yet, in the end, it
is mokùa which trumps the other three.
The text unfolds in a regular fashion. Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana introduces
each interlocutor, often using a phrase that foreshadows the interlocu-
tor’s position: Vidura is ‘recalling the treatises on dharma’ (dharma-
(cid:3)(cid:2)stram anusmaran); Arjuna is an ‘expert in the treatises on artha’
(artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stravi(cid:3)(cid:2)rada); the twins are ‘conversant with dharma and
artha’ (dharm(cid:2)rthaku(cid:3)alau).68 Each character in turn then relates his
argument: Vidura extols dharma (161.5-8); Arjuna artha (161.10-19);
the twins Nakula and Sahadeva (161.21-26) think dharma and artha
belong together (though dharma should come first, then artha and
finally k(cid:2)ma); while Bh(cid:8)ma extols the priority of k(cid:2)ma (161.28-36).
Bh(cid:8)ma adds a further argument that all three should be equally served
(161.38), before Yudhiùñhira closes the discussion with his argument
for the priority of mokùa (161.41-6).
Because this text concerns the scheme of the puruù(cid:2)rthas, a central
ideological construct in ancient Indian thought, it has attracted the at-
tention of a number of scholars. Dumézil briefly discusses it as part of
his broader trifunctional analysis of the Mbh. For him it is an example
of a tendency in the Mbh (and especially the (cid:6)P) for less than suc-
cessful comparisons along trifunctional lines between the five brothers
and the puruù(cid:2)rthas, a comparison which breaks down with Bh(cid:8)ma’s
association with k(cid:2)ma, the third puruù(cid:2)rtha, and the twins association
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
67 N(cid:8)lakaõñha, however, takes the trivarga in this instance to refer to k(cid:2)ma, krodha
and lobha, ‘desire’, ‘anger’ and ‘greed’.

384 CHAPTER NINE
with artha and dharma, the first and second puruù(cid:2)rthas, thus subor-
dinating Bh(cid:8)ma in the scheme to the twins.69 For the comparison to be
‘successful’ in trifunctional terms, the twins ought to be subordinate to
Bh(cid:8)ma. Dumézil is too sensitive a reader of the Mbh, however, to miss
the good reasons that account for these ‘less than successful’ trifunc-
tional associations, pointing to Bh(cid:8)ma’s passionate nature, his ten-
dency for ‘fureurs immediates’, and to the connection of the twins,
promoters of ‘un artha moralisé’, to economic activity through their
association with the vai(cid:5)ya. Importantly, he also recognises the under-
lying character traits that explain the connection between Arjuna and
artha and Yudhiùñhira and mokùa (and Vidura and dharma). Dumé-
zil’s approach, therefore, clearly establishes the intersection of this
text with the broader narrative and thematic concerns of the Mbh,
even while it does not quite measure up to the demands of his trifunc-
tional analysis. Biardeau builds on the work of Dumézil, though she is
not so concerned with his trifunctionalism. As part of her argument
that Arjuna is the Mbh’s ideal king, suggested in this text through his
association with artha, a value with specifically royal connotations,
she too reads the text for what it might contribute to an understanding
of the P(cid:3)õóavas’ characters.70 As with Dumézil, the strength of
Biardeau’s approach is her appreciation of this text’s broader in-
terconnections with the Mbh narrative through these characterological
associations. A third approach, by Wilhelm, is quite different from
these two. While his analysis occurs in his study of dharma in non-
dharma(cid:5)(cid:3)stric literature,71 and therefore is less concerned with the
Mbh as such, he does suggest that this “sermon of release psychologi-
cally fits the frame of mind of the heroes after the great battle”.72
Wilhelm’s principal reason for discussing this text is to establish that
there were various positions in ancient India regarding the order of
priority of the puruù(cid:2)rthas, and he therefore sees each interlocutor re-

flecting “authentic” views “actually expressed by Indians in ancient
times”.73
Building upon these insights, I consider in further detail this text’s
syntactic position in the unfolding narrative of the (cid:6)P. I have already
noted the important transitional position of this unit, a position further
reflected in the specific structure of the order in which its dialogue
unfolds. Multipart dialogues involving the brothers, often Draupad(cid:8)
and sometimes other individuals, occasionally occur in the Mbh (e.g.
2.12-17; 5.70ff.; 5.149; 13.14-18), and deserve an in depth study to
explore their full narrative function. A superficial survey suggests that
they tend to occur either before or after controversial decisions or at
transitional positions (often both) and, as a narrative device, enable the
canvassing of different solutions to a problem through the representa-
tion of different views in the voices of different characters. This is not
to say that these dialogues are in any way a ‘true’ dialectic; more often
than not the solution is clearly predetermined by the direction of the
narrative, or implicit in the relative authority of the characters in-
volved, and the reader is usually certain of whose opinion will hold
sway once the dialogue is over.
The particular narrative function of the present multipart dialogue
can be explored further by comparing it with an earlier ‘debate’ in the
(cid:6)P, a debate to which this text forms a counterpart. This dialogue,
which takes place from (cid:6)P 8 onwards, has already been explored in
chapter four above, where I also discussed its context: Yudhiùñhira’s
distress at the war and his resolve to renounce the kingdom. The ar-
gument against him is quite long, and becomes progressively more
scholastic as sages like Devasth(cid:3)na ((cid:6)P 20-21) and Vy(cid:3)sa ((cid:6)P 23ff.)
take over. But the most vigorous stages involve Yudhiùñhira’s siblings
and their shared wife Draupad(cid:8). Against Yudhiùñhira’s desire to re-
nounce his proper royal duties, the other participants strongly defend
the justness of the events of the war, and the necessity for him to as-
sume his rule of the kingdom. While this earlier debate is not as neatly
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
73 Wilhelm (“The Concept,” p.68) also suggests that there are some formal simi-
larities in the presentation of data in this text and the KA. Notably where “authentic
views are presented in a fictitious style as the statements of legendary teachers” and
“the last place in the debate is best”. One could also add the wording used by Vidura,
who outlines the (cid:2)tmasaüpad, the ‘perfections of the self’, a wording echoed in the
KA (see e.g. KA 1.17.43; 5.4.2; 5.6.33; 6.1.6; 12.3.15). This text, however, is a liter-
ary construction of a different kind to those discussions in the KA with which it shares
a formal similarity.
386 CHAPTER NINE
structured around the puruù(cid:2)rthas as SU 27, its arguments still revolve
around the poles they represent: what is the relationship of dharma
(duty, morality, ethical behaviour) to artha (political expediency,
wealth, prosperity), k(cid:2)ma (desire, enjoyment) and mokùa (personal
liberation)? The last of these is clearly represented by Yudhiùñhira’s
desire to renounce the kingdom. The most contested term in the earlier
debate is dharma. Is it more dharmic for Yudhiùñhira to act as a king
with all the attendant violence, or renounce the kingdom and, without
harming any living being, pursue his own liberation? While each has
their say, the most frequent participants are Arjuna and Bh(cid:8)ma,74 un-
doubtedly because they represent the epitome of kùatriya duty. Arjuna
especially, as Biardeau so cogently demonstrates, has a close connec-
tion to all the symbols and functions that coalesce around kingship.
Thus in (cid:6)P 8, as in the present unit, he argues for the importance of
artha, and in (cid:6)P 15 he eulogises the daõóa, whose metonymic rela-
tionship with kingship we have already noted in the discussion of the
previous unit. The crucial narrative purpose of this debate is to con-
vince Yudhiùñhira not to renounce the kingdom, and to take up his du-
ties as king. Therefore it brings into the foreground the relationship of
kingship to dharma. Yudhiùñhira, of course, acquiesces to the argu-
ments presented to him, providing the narrative framework for the
royal instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP sequence. Once Yudhiùñhira
agrees to assume the kingship he is then instructed in the full range of
duties incumbent upon him as king.
What then does a comparison between this earlier debate and the
present text reveal? The earlier debate is of course more complex, and
its terms of reference—the attributes articulated in the four puruù(cid:2)-
rthas—are part of the contest. This is not the case with SU 27, where
it is the interrelationships of the four puruù(cid:2)rthas at issue, rather than
what constitutes them. In the earlier dialogue, the brothers (and Drau-
pad(cid:8)) are more of a piece, arguing generally that Yudhiùñhira should
rule and enjoy the earth he has just (necessarily) conquered. In the
present debate, each character voices a different argument structured,
as we have seen, around the puruù(cid:2)rthas. This structuring role of the
puruù(cid:2)rthas also accounts for the absence of Draupad(cid:8) and the pres-
ence of Vidura. With Yudhiùñhira assuming the role of advocate for

CODA 387
mokùa, Vidura is the natural person to be the advocate for dharma,
since he (like Yudhiùñhira) has a close relationship with dharma.75
Draupad(cid:8), on the other hand, is not typically associated with a puruù(cid:2)-
rtha, but rather, as queen, shares a symbolic association with the
earth.76 While Vidura and each of the brothers has a different voice in
accordance with the puruù(cid:2)rtha (or combination of puruù(cid:2)rthas) with
which they share a deeper affiliation, there is a sense in which the dis-
tinctions between them are illusory. There is a general feeling of bon-
homie that accompanies their utterances in this text, a levity entirely
lacking from the earlier debate. No doubt this reflects their quite dis-
tinct contexts, since in this text there is no suggestion that Yudhiùñhira
will threaten to abdicate the kingship. This sense of levity is especially
apparent in Bh(cid:8)ma’s speech on k(cid:2)ma, ‘desire, love’. Despite whatever
characterological sense it makes for Bh(cid:8)ma to make this speech,77 or
despite such a view possibly representing an ‘authentic’ historical po-
sition,78 the facetiousness of his argument is clearly apparent. Bh(cid:8)ma’s
speech has a narrative function, and that function is to prepare the

75 Vidura, brother of P(cid:3)õóu and Dh(cid:7)taraùñra and son via niyoga of Vy(cid:3)sa and a
(cid:5)(cid:4)dra woman, is described as an incarnation of Dharma, cursed to be born in a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra’s
womb (see especially Mbh 1.57.77-81; 100.28; 101 and 15.35.21). He is known for
his virtue and wisdom, but his advice is frequently ignored by the Dh(cid:3)rtar(cid:3)ùñras.
Yudhiùñhira, of course, is Dharma’s son, but he is described as a portion (aü(cid:3)a) of
Dharma too (1.61.84). Both Vidura and Yudhiùñhira entered Dharma after their deaths
(18.5.19). For discussions of Vidura, see G. Dumézil, “La Transposition des Dieux
Souverains Mineurs en Héros dans le Mah(cid:3)bh(cid:3)rata,” IIJ, 3 (1959), pp.1-16; Mythe et
Epopée I, pp.146, 151-2, 174-5; Biardeau, Études—bhakti et avat(cid:2)ra, pp. 109-110.
Hiltebeitel, The Ritual, p.200, suggests that for Vidura, in distinction from kings like
Yudhiùñhira, the virtues (i.e. dharma) “are his to recognize rather than possess”.
76 On Draupad(cid:8)’s connection with the earth see M. Biardeau, “Brahmanes et
potiers,” Annuaire de l’École Pratique des Hautes Études, 79 (1971-72), pp.40-1;
Biardeau, Le Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.2, p.388; A. Hiltebeitel, “Draupad(cid:8)’s garments,” Indo-
Iranian Journal, 22 (1980); Bailey, “Suffering,” pp.118-19. We might possibly expect
Draupad(cid:8) to have a role in demanding Yudhiùñhira hold to his royal dharma, as she
does in (cid:6)P 14 and Mbh 3.33, however this would be out of step with the conviviality
of the discussion given Draupad(cid:8)’s frequent tendency (for good reason) to be a stri-
dent critic of Yudhiùñhira (see (cid:6)P 14.4; Brockington, “Husband or King?” p.256; Bai-
ley, “Suffering,” pp.111-19). Alternatively, as a woman we might expect her to have
some particular knowledge of k(cid:2)ma. However, in the context of kingship and ruling,
the trivarga of dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma is presented essentially as a masculinist ide-
ology that serves as one of a number of shorthand references for a full teaching in
royal dharma (note that in (cid:6)P 15.3 daõóa is equated with the trivarga). Thus, in a
royal context k(cid:2)ma has the primary connotation of ‘enjoying the earth’ (a point made
clear in (cid:6)P 10 by Bh(cid:8)ma—who, not surprisingly, has a tendency to use food meta-
phors in his argumentation—and, indeed, Draupad(cid:8) in (cid:6)P 14.9, 13 and 20).

ground for Yudhiùñhira’s final authoritative statement. Bh(cid:8)ma is the
straw man who makes even wiser whatever conclusion is drawn by
Yudhiùñhira.79 In fact, Bh(cid:8)ma clearly establishes the artificial nature of
his hubris when in 161.38 he deliberately undermines his argument on
the preeminence of k(cid:2)ma, and announces the necessary equality of
each member of the trivarga:
dharm(cid:2)rthak(cid:2)m(cid:2)þ samam eva sevy(cid:2) yas tv ekasev(cid:5) sa naro jaghanyaþ|
dvayos tu dakùaü pravadanti madhyaü sa uttamo yo niratas trivarge||
Law, welfare and love should be served equally; but a man who serves
only one is the lowest; who is competent in two is middling; and who is
devoted to all three, he is the best.
Regardless of the apparent argumentation in the speeches of each par-
ticipant preceding Yudhiùñhira, it is this that is the real point of their
collective speeches. While each gives an account of an individual pu-
ruù(cid:2)rtha (or combination of puruù(cid:2)rthas), they should really be taken
collectively as sanctioning the merit of the three that constitute the tri-
varga, dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma. In this sanction they stand, however,
separate from Yudhiùñhira (though Yudhiùñhira does not deny their
importance either). It is here that the structures of the two dialogues
have a deeper underlying commonality, for the essential distinction in
both texts is between Yudhiùñhira and the rest, not between each indi-
vidual participant per se. There is, however, an important distinction
between the two debates. Unlike the argument in the early chapters of
the (cid:6)P, where Yudhiùñhira was cast as a malcontent, in this unit
Yudhiùñhira is cast as the authoritative voice, announcing, in effect,
the sequel to the royal instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP. This sequel is,
of course, the MDhP, the teachings on liberation, the subject matter of
which, we know all too well, is the theoretical and practical space
Yudhiùñhira so often wishes to inhabit. The implications of this dis-
tinction will be explored further below.
Let us look a little closer at the way SU 27 manages the transition
from the three attributes that form the trivarga to mokùa—which even-
tually will become the fourth attribute of the caturvarga—and how
this reflects the broader transition occurring in the (cid:6)P. After Bh(cid:8)ma
finishes speaking, Yudhiùñhira thinks about what each of the partici-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
79 Cf. Brockington (“Husband or King,” p.256) who observes that Bh(cid:8)ma functions
to inject “human warmth” and “gentle human” in the Mbh and “he and his younger
brothers are there to enable Yudhiùñhira to explain what is right”.
CODA 389
pants has said and replies ‘with a smile’ (161.40). Though he compli-
ments his brothers and Vidura on their learning, his terms subtly sug-
gest a restriction: ‘Without doubt all you good men have clearly de-
termined the dharma(cid:3)(cid:2)stras and understood the authorities.’80 Yet the
‘decisive’ (naiùñhika) statement he asked for in his pra(cid:3)na has not
been delivered, and he is compelled to address the problem himself.81
His brothers and Vidura have addressed his question in the terms
through which they understand the world, terms with which the (cid:6)P has
been preoccupied for more than seventy-five chapters, no less than a
complete training in the worldly matters of dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma.82
Yet, for Yudhiùñhira there is something else beyond an attachment to
the puruù(cid:2)rthas, indeed beyond all categories and oppositions
(161.42-3):

A man attached to neither evil nor good, neither artha, dharma nor
k(cid:2)ma, who is free of fault and regards gold and a lump of earth as the
same, is free from the acquisition of things for happiness or sadness.
People, inherently attended by birth and death and old age and sickness,
have been instructed extensively by numerous people; they praise lib-
eration but we know nothing about this.
The last two padas of verse 43 mark a lacuna in the P(cid:3)õóavas’ learn-
ing: they know nothing of mokùa, ‘liberation’, which stanza 161.42
has already suggested transcends (but does not cancel) the worldly
concerns of dharma, artha and k(cid:2)ma. Both the lord Svayaübh(cid:4)
(Brahm(cid:3)) and people ‘devoted to final emancipation’ (nirv(cid:2)õapara)
say that ‘these things [birth, death, etc.] do not exist for a person not
bound to attachments’ (snehe nabaddhasya na santi t(cid:2)ni). Therefore a
person should have neither ‘likes nor dislikes’ (priyam apriyam ca).83
A person is subject to fate (161.45) and, therefore, the way to mokùa is
through detachment, rather than action (161.46):
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

Through action a person can not obtain this unobtainable thing (artha)
[i.e mokùa]. All which is predestined comes to be, know this. Even a
person found wanting in regard to the set of three [dharma, etc.] finds
this thing (artha) [i.e. mokùa]. Therefore, this secret is for the welfare of
the people.
This is Yudhiùñhira’s final word and the others ‘roared and rejoiced’
(praõedu(cid:3) ca jaharùire) in approval, indicating once again the general
spirit of bonhomie that has accompanied the dialogue.
Despite the apparent similarity of his position in each case, there is
clearly a marked contrast between Yudhiùñhira’s reception here and
the derision he receives in the earlier dialogue in the (cid:6)P. What ac-
counts for this difference? And does it have any narrative signifi-
cance? It is important to note that Yudhiùñhira’s position in each de-
bate is not precisely the same, even though each shares a concern for
individual salvation. Unlike in the earlier debate, in this unit Yudhi-
ùñhira does not espouse the merits of renunciation. Rather, his very
brief argument is reminiscent of the karmayoga found in the BhG.84
Since people have no control over their destiny, and their actions and
the outcomes of these actions are predestined, the only soteriological
option is to act without attachment (one might say, in the spirit of the
BhG, without regard for the fruits of his actions). As Biardeau says,
detachment while acting in the world is liberation.85 This variation in
the two arguments put forward by Yudhiùñhira suggests that he has
been transformed in the course of his royal instructions. Yet, while he
now willingly accepts his duty as king, he has not lost his own desire
for personal salvation. The two, rather, have melded. He can act as
king and seek salvation at the same time. The depth of Yudhiùñhira’s
understanding is acknowledged in the lack of opposition to his
‘mokùa’ argument by his brothers and Vidura, which in turn prepares
the way for a smooth transition to the MDhP, a transition which their
earlier hostility would have complicated. Their celebration is a tacit
recognition of the appropriate context of Yudhiùñhira’s argument. The
narrative elements intersecting here reveal a deeper, underlying struc-
ture. Just as the exposition of the trivarga by the brothers and Vidura
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

CODA 391
is followed and enveloped by the exposition of mokùa, so on the syn-
tactic level of the (cid:6)P, the royal instructions of the RDhP/(cid:2)DhP se-
quence are followed by the MDhP. A logic of action informs this
structure, a logic that models the proper duties and priorities of the
royal life. A king’s desire for his salvation must follow the proper
completion of his royal duty; or, rather, it follows from the proper
completion of his royal duty. The syntactic order of the (cid:6)P text, just as
of the text of SU 27, mirrors, therefore, the proper syntactic order of
the royal life and the proper priority of the king’s concerns.
9.4 ‘The tale of the ungrateful man’
(Mbh 12.162-167; SU 28)
The thematic content and transitional characteristics of SU 27 might
lead us to expect that the MDhP should continue directly after it, an
impression potentially suggested in its final stanza spoken by Vai(cid:5)aü-
p(cid:3)yana to Janamejaya (161.48):
suc(cid:2)ruvarõ(cid:2)kùara(cid:3)abdabh(cid:6)ùit(cid:2)ü

puna(cid:3) ca papraccha saridvar(cid:2)sutaü
tataþ paraü dharmam ah(cid:5)nasattvaþ||
Having heard those words of P(cid:3)rtha, prince, which were decorated with
delightful vowels, syllables and words, and were pleasing to the mind, a
speech from which all thorns had been shaken, those lords proclaimed
him as a mountain. Again that man who had never lost his goodness
questioned that son of the best of rivers about the law (dharma) that
comes after this.
However, such an expectation will be modified depending on how
tataþ paraü dharmam (‘the law that follows from this’) in 161.48f is
understood to operate. Does it mark a thematic shift from the royal
instructions of the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP sections to the MDhP that fol-
lows? Or does it simply indicate that Yudhiùñhira was urging Bh(cid:8)ùma
to move onto the next lesson about the law (dharma) that comes ‘after
that’ (i.e. the discussion that has just occurred in SU 27)?86 If the for-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
86 N(cid:8)lakaõñha suggests three possibilities for tataþ: yudhiùñhir(cid:2)t, ‘after Yudhiùñhira’
(i.e. his speech); p(cid:6)rvokt(cid:2)t, ‘after those things spoken about first’ (by which I under-

mer, it might be reasonable to assume that SU 27 was at some point
the concluding text of the (cid:2)DhP and that SU 28 was added by some
later redactor.87 If it is taken in a general way as referring to ‘what
comes after this’, however, then the phrase is ambiguous; Yudhiùñhira
might be referring to a specific ‘law after this’ articulated in the pre-
ceding text (i.e. mokùa) or, more broadly, the MDhP, or he might sim-
ply be referring to the next lesson on law in the series of lessons
Bh(cid:8)ùma is offering. Without further discriminators in either case, it is
simply impossible to decide one way or the other. Yet even if this
unit’s appearance here is the result of later redactorial history, it
clearly shares thematic contiguity with the (cid:2)DhP, and its redactors
have been careful to provide it with the necessary rhetorical features
to embed it in its broader context. It has, for instance, the requisite
pra(cid:3)na and concluding statement (CS). The latter further includes a
summation of the moral of the tale in the terms of its introductory
frame (167.18-22; cf. 162.16, 25, 27), a question from Bh(cid:8)ùma asking
Yudhiùñhira if he wants to ‘hear more’ (thereby providing a fluid nar-
rative transition to the next unit, the first of the MDhP), and, in its fi-
nal stanza (167.24), an intervention by Vai(cid:5)aüp(cid:3)yana (reflecting the
text’s transitional position).
This unit is the second longest of the (cid:2)DhP, consisting of 151 stan-
zas. Most of it is a tale and, like the long narratives in SUs 14, 15 and
17, the text in this unit is spread over a number of chapters.88 Some-
what unusually, the fable is preceded by a moderately lengthy discus-
sion that addresses the principal themes the fable is being used to
demonstrate. This discussion is Bh(cid:8)ùma’s initial response to a pra(cid:3)na
in which Yudhiùñhira expresses a desire to know what distinguishes
those ‘gentle’ (saumya) men that make good friends and allies (162.2-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
stand the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP instructions); and sarveù(cid:2)ü v(cid:2)ky(cid:2)t ‘after all their
speeches’ (i.e. the speeches in the (cid:3)aóg(cid:5)t(cid:2) of (cid:2)DhP 161).
87 This is how Fitzgerald understands it in his translation, taking tataþ param (“the
Law beyond these”) as marking a distinction between either the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP
taken together as one and the MDhP, or the trivarga discussed in (cid:2)DhP 161 and
mokùa (see The Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.778 note to 161.48). Fitzgerald has been cri-
tiqued in this respect by Hiltebeitel, “On Reading Fitzgerald’s Vy(cid:3)sa,” p.246 n.20,
who suggests that Yudhiùñhira “probably just wants to hear more about dharma” (per-
haps taking tataþ param as synonymous for ataþ param). Note, however, the usage of
tataþ param in the sense of ‘after that’ in Mbh 1.2.39, 59, 61, 64, 67, in which there
are clearly syntactic implications for textual components.
88 Unlike the long narratives in SUs 9-12 and 16, which are not split over multiple
chapters.
CODA 393
4). Not forgetting that Yudhiùñhira is a king, there is a political subtext
to this pra(cid:3)na, a subtext drawn out by Bh(cid:8)ùma’s statement of intent
(SI) in 162.5, in which he demands Yudhiùñhira’s attention to his ex-
planation of ‘men with whom one should be allied’ (saüdhey(cid:2)n puru-
ù(cid:2)n) and ‘men with whom one shouldn’t’ (asaüdhey(cid:2)n). In typical
(cid:5)(cid:3)stric analytical style, the qualities of such men are respectively cata-
logued, the former in 162.17-25 and the latter in stanzas 162.6-16.89 It
is the latter, however, who are the particular subject matter of this
unit. Such a man is the ‘enemy who has the face of an ally’ ((cid:3)atrur
mitramukho),90 a ‘vile’ (adhama) and ‘ungrateful man’ (k(cid:8)taghna),
with whom ‘one should in no way be allied’ (na saüdheyaþ kathaü
cana).91
After describing the man ‘who should be allied with’, Bh(cid:8)ùma reit-
erates that, of all the evil-doing people he has described, the ‘lowest’
(adhama) is ‘the ungrateful man who murders his friends’ (k(cid:8)taghno
mitragh(cid:2)takaþ).92 It is this last statement that prompts Yudhiùñhira to
ask (162.27):
vistareõ(cid:2)rthasaübandhaü (cid:3)rotum icch(cid:2)mi p(cid:2)rthiva|
mitradroh(cid:5) k(cid:8)taghna(cid:3) ca yaþ proktas taü ca me vada||
I want to hear at length, prince, about what is connected to this matter.
Tell me about the man you’ve mentioned, that man who is ungrateful
and hostile to friends.
The request for further information (RC in FIGURE 8) is a formal fea-
ture this unit shares with SU 14, and which distinguishes these two
units from other presentations of fables in the (cid:2)DhP.93 To this request
Bh(cid:8)ùma relates the tale that forms the greater body of this unit. While
there is a political subtext informing the frame that embeds this narra-
tive, the narrative itself describes the conduct of a br(cid:3)hman, and hence
any political angle to do with ‘political allies’ can only be established
allegorically. The following summary of the tale indicates its divisions
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
89 These analyses are especially reminiscent of the KA’s accounts of the saüpat,
‘excellences’, of each constituent of the state.

latter—engaged to be Karõa’s charioteer, but already enticed by Yudhiùñhira to betray
him by destroying his will to fight—ridicules his desire to fight Arjuna. See also

394 CHAPTER NINE
into chapters, which, as with other multi-chapter units in the (cid:2)DhP,
tend to fall along narrative lines, each of the chapters describing a spa-
tial shift in scene:
162.29-49(cid:3) A br(cid:3)hman from the middle region (madhyade(cid:3)a) who ne-
glected his proper duties went to the north among the barbarians (mlec-
chas). Entering a village to beg for a livelihood, a wealthy bandit
(dasyu) gave him clothes, a house and a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra woman. The br(cid:3)hman,
who was from the Gautama gotra, lived in the (cid:6)abara’s house among
the bandits (dasyus), learning hunting and killing to the point that he
became just like them. A pious br(cid:3)hman, a friend of Gautama’s from
their student days, visited the village and went straight to his house.
Shocked to see the way he lived, he abused Gautama for failing in his
br(cid:3)hmaõic duties and insisted that he leave the village. Admitting his
error, Gautama promised to do so.
163(cid:3) Gautama headed for the ocean, joining a company of merchants
along the way. A ruttish elephant attacked them, but Gautama managed
to escape and headed north seeking a means to live. He came across a
beautiful forest full of wonderful birds and took shelter beneath a great
Banyan tree, falling asleep as the sun set. The tree was the home of
N(cid:3)ó(cid:8)jaïgha, the king of the cranes. Returning from a visit to Brahm(cid:3)’s
world, the crane discovered the br(cid:3)hman beneath his tree-home. Gau-
tama looked in amazement at the crane (who was also known as R(cid:3)ja-
dharman) and, hungry and thirsty, contemplated killing him. R(cid:3)jadhar-
man, however, greeted him as an honoured guest.
164(cid:3) Gautama was surprised by R(cid:3)jadharman’s sweet voice. R(cid:3)ja-
dharman prepared a seat of (cid:6)(cid:3)la flowers, and gave him some fish and lit
him a fire; then he fanned Gautama with his wings. When he asked
about his gotra, he was told only that he was a Gautama. Presented with
a bed, the Gautama br(cid:3)hman lay down. R(cid:3)jadharman asked him why he
had come, and Gautama explained that he was heading to the ocean to
attain wealth. R(cid:3)jadharman was delighted to help him, and told him
about his friend, the demon-lord Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa (‘Ugly-eyes’), who would
provide for Gautama at R(cid:3)jadharman’s behest. Gautama left the next
day for Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa’s city, Meruvraja.
165(cid:3) The lord of demons received Gautama with honour, and asked
him about his family and daily practices, and about his home and his
wife’s family. Gautama admitted that, though born in the middle coun-
try (madhyade(cid:3)a), he was now living in a (cid:6)abara’s house and married to
a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra widow. As a favour to R(cid:3)jadharman, the king resolved to feed
and give gifts to Gautama on the night of the full moon of the month of
K(cid:2)rttika, when he honours all br(cid:3)hmans. At the appointed time Vir(cid:4)-
p(cid:3)kùa gave all the br(cid:3)hmans gifts and rich food. He then sent them
home with the assurance that for one day they would be safe from the
demons. Gautama returned to the tree exhausted from carrying all his
gold. He was properly welcomed again by R(cid:3)jadharman. But, worrying
CODA 395
about sustaining himself on his trip home, Gautama resolved to kill the
crane for food.
166(cid:3) While he was sleeping, Gautama killed R(cid:3)jadharman. He cooked
him and left. Noticing that the crane hadn’t visited him as usual, Vir(cid:4)-
p(cid:3)kùa worried for R(cid:3)jadharman’s safety, remembering how like a ban-
dit (dasyu) the Gautama br(cid:3)hman appeared. He ordered his son to go to
the crane’s tree-home. Finding R(cid:3)jadharman’s skeleton, he chased Gau-
tama and took him and the crane’s remains back to his father. The
grieving king ordered that Gautama be killed and eaten by the demons.
However, the demons didn’t want the taint of his sin, and suggested he
be given to the dasyus (bandits). But the dasyus did not want to eat him
either. (Bh(cid:8)ùma explains that an ungrateful betrayer of friends is the one
person for whom there is no expiation.) His sin is so bad that not even
carrion-eaters would eat him.
167(cid:3) Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa performed R(cid:3)jadharman’s obsequial rites. His mother,
the cow Surabhi, Dakùa’s daughter, arrived and dripped milk from her
mouth onto the funeral pyre, returning R(cid:3)jadharman to life. Indra ex-
plained why the crane had died: Brahm(cid:3) had cursed R(cid:3)jadharman to
die, for he hadn’t been to see him as was his habit. At R(cid:3)jadharman’s
request, Indra revived Gautama, and R(cid:3)jadharman lovingly embraced
him. R(cid:3)jadharman then went home, and subsequently visited Brahm(cid:3)
who properly honoured him with hospitality. Gautama returned to the
(cid:6)abara’s house and had two sons with his (cid:5)(cid:4)dra wife, both of whom be-
came evil-doers. The gods cursed him to go to hell.
This narrative is clearly a cautionary tale that revisits some of the cen-
tral concerns raised by the notion of (cid:2)paddharma as discussed in the
(cid:2)DhP and elsewhere. Picking up a thread that runs through many ear-
lier units, we are again in the domain of dasyus, ‘bandits’ living on the
margins of the br(cid:3)hmaõic socio-cultural world. Dasyu is the word ha-
bitually used in this text to describe this group, a term which, as has
been previously discussed, generally marks banditry and exclusion
from br(cid:3)hmaõic social customs and laws.94 They are, in addition, said
to be living in the north among mlecchas (barbarians) (162.28), and
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
94 See especially the discussions of units 4 and 6 above. In the following I maintain
the translation ‘bandit’ for dasyu to keep it distinct from barbarian (typically, mlec-
cha), since it is not clear that the text at hand employs these terms synonymously (no-
tably mleccha is used just once in 162.28 when Bh(cid:8)ùma localises the story among the
northern barbarians; but he never uses it to refer to a character in the story). It is clear,
however, that in a very general way (i.e. devoid of ethnic associations) the dasyus’
lifestyle (e.g. hunting) is regarded, from a br(cid:3)hmaõic perspective, as barbaric. The
dasyu, however, is also capable of being civil (e.g. he treats the Gautama br(cid:3)hman
quite generously). I must here thank Alf Hiltebeitel for some helpful criticisms of an
earlier draft of this section.
396 CHAPTER NINE
seem to be identified on three occasions as (cid:6)abaras.95 Parasher has
suggested that this latter term indicates a tribal group typically associ-
ated with the Vindhyas,96 a chain of mountains lying to the south of
Madhyade(cid:5)a (from where the Gautama br(cid:3)hman hails) raising the re-
markable possibility that we are dealing with a southern dasyu ‘tribe’
or ‘marauding gang’ that has migrated to live among the barbarians of
the north.
Associating with cultural outsiders like dasyus and mlecchas raises
important problems for proponents of br(cid:3)hmaõic cultural values. Yet
there is a veneer of legitimacy behind the Gautama br(cid:3)hman’s stay in
this dasyu village among northern barbarians, since he seeks a means
to live during a time of hardship brought about by the seasonal onset
of the rains.97 This reflects a notion of (cid:2)paddharma that is quite typi-
cal of the dharma literature (and found also in the (cid:2)DhP), in which a
‘crisis’ is understood in the ‘subjective’ terms of the impossibility of a
person sustaining himself by normal standards as prescribed by nor-
mative texts (note that, in normative terms, the problem here is both
living in a dasyu village and accepting food from ‘low-born’ people,
rather than, say, begging per se; of course, he subsequently adopts
modes of behaviour which are even more problematic). Despite the
fact that this narrative serves to illustrate the characteristics of a k(cid:8)ta-
ghna man, the question of the legitimacy of the means used to sustain
life in hardship forms a significant subtext giving it much of its mo-
mentum. This is confirmed by the frequent mention of the motivation
for the br(cid:3)hman’s behaviour. He came to the village ‘for a livelihood’
(v(cid:8)ttyartha), and after escaping the elephants, he runs northwards
‘seeking a livelihood’ (j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rthin). He explains to the crane that he is
‘needy’ (daridra) and ‘desiring material wealth’ (dravy(cid:2)rtha), and
wonders what he can do to ‘support his life’ (pr(cid:2)õasaüdh(cid:2)raõa) on
the path back from R(cid:3)jadharman’s tree with his arms loaded with the

(cid:3)abara as indicating the dasyu.

demon-lord’s goods.98 Other narratives in the (cid:2)DhP which dramatise
individuals in situations of distress use very similar terms. For exam-
ple, in ‘the dialogue of the cat and mouse’ both characters are de-
scribed as ‘desiring life’ (j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rthin),99 a condition which obviously
informs their behaviour. And in ‘the dialogue between Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra and
the (cid:3)vapaca’, Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra ‘desires to live’ (j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rthin),100 and excuses
his eating of dog meat precisely in terms of pr(cid:2)õadh(cid:2)raõa, i.e. it is the
only thing by which he can ‘support his life’.101 The present story,
however, does not use these terms uncritically. Indeed, it places into
question the legitimate grounds for these motivations. We shall shortly
further explore how it does this, noting for the moment that the Gau-
tama br(cid:3)hman’s ‘desire’ or ‘need to live’ (j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rtha) becomes a ‘de-
sire for wealth’ (dravy(cid:2)rtha) and, indeed, a ‘desire to kill’ (hiü-
s(cid:2)rtha).102 When, then, are a br(cid:3)hman’s ‘desires’ and ‘needs’ (both of
which can be understood in the sense of artha) legitimate, and when is
he merely ruled by his ‘desire’?
The problem of the legitimacy of the Gautama br(cid:3)hman’s behav-
iour is foregrounded very early in the story. Having adopted the dasyu
way of living by killing birds, Gautama succumbs to the very social
pathology that br(cid:3)hmaõic dharma aims to avoid and which, as we
have seen, is frequently the anxiety underlying (cid:2)paddharma, whether
as its condition or its consequence (162.36):103

Devoted to violence, devoid of compassion, always intent upon killing
living things, Gautama, due to his proximity with the bandits, became
the same as them.
His old friend ‘from his own country and with whom he had studied’
(sabrahmac(cid:2)r(cid:5) tad de(cid:3)yaþ) arrives and is shocked to see him in this
way and asks, ‘How is it that you’ve become a bandit?’ (dasyubh(cid:2)vaü

(cid:2)pad; as consequence because, as here, to pursue behaviour which is reasonable in

gataþ kathaü).104 The br(cid:3)hman replies that he was only ‘seeking a
livelihood’ (v(cid:8)ttyartha), but now ‘seeing you [his friend]’ (tvaddar-
(cid:3)an(cid:2)t) he is embarrassed into understanding his breach of propriety
(162.48-9): ‘I realise my goal has been accomplished’ (k(cid:8)t(cid:2)rthaü
vedmy ahaü). The br(cid:3)hman has understood that the need for a means
of living (v(cid:8)ttyartha/j(cid:5)vit(cid:2)rtha) can only legitimise his behaviour for a
restricted period (his need for shelter and food during the rainy sea-
son), and now that that period has passed (his ‘purpose accomplished’
k(cid:8)t(cid:2)rtha) so also have the conditions for which v(cid:8)ttyartha is a justifi-
able excuse, and he is now violating his dharma.
The br(cid:3)hman’s descent into a barbaric condition, which implicates
the broader world in a decline into dharma- and varõa-saükara, is
heightened and made more complex through a series of juxtapositions,
especially with honourably acting bandits (dasyus) and demons (r(cid:2)k-
ùasas). Gautama is often described in terms emphasising his disjunc-
tion from his proper nature, as when he is described as brahmavarjita,
‘devoid of brahman’, at the beginning of the tale (162.29), where
brahman probably stands for the Veda, but also entails that the br(cid:3)h-
man is defective in the specific qualities that set him apart (partly by
dint of his association to the Veda). This neglect of his br(cid:3)hmaõic re-
sponsibilities and lack of ‘br(cid:3)hmaõic lustre’ is reiterated later (e.g.
165.3, 166.8). In contrast to Gautama, the other characters are typi-
cally painted as pious and aware of their proper place in the world.
The wealthy dasyu in the village, for instance, is described as brah-
maõya, someone who is ‘friendly to br(cid:3)hmans’ (as he demonstrates
with his generosity to Gautama) and hence as someone who has a rela-
tionship to the kind of orthodoxy that the word brahman encodes. He
is also someone who ‘knows the distinctions between the classes’
(sarvavarõavid), which is to say, precisely the knowledge that Gau-
tama fails in (162.30). Similarly, Gautama’s friend, who arrives in the
village and rebukes him for being ‘like a bandit (dasyu)’, is also called
brahmaõya (here denoting that he has a special relationship to ortho-
dox sacrality), and is sv(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)yaparama, ‘dedicated to recitation’, ni-
yat(cid:2)h(cid:2)ra ‘restrained in his consumption of food’ and vedap(cid:2)raga ‘de-
voted to the Veda’.105 This br(cid:3)hman is as Gautama should be, having
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

CODA 399
no contact with (cid:5)(cid:4)dras and avoiding their food (162.40). As the adjec-
tive brahmaõya suggests, he is in proper touch with the core of his
br(cid:3)hmaõic identity. A recurring motif in the fable’s juxtapositions of
the adharmic br(cid:3)hman with its other (dharmic) participants is
atithip(cid:6)jana, ‘guest worship’. When, for example, Gautama winds up
at the foot of the crane’s tree he is received with all the proper rites
(163.23, 164.2-3). Similarly, the dasyu receives him with due generos-
ity on his arrival in his village, and the demon-lord Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa receives
him well (despite his misgivings) and then confers gifts on him along
with all the other br(cid:3)hmans (165.11ff.) with the ‘rite prescribed by
rule’ (vidhid(cid:8)ùñena karmaõ(cid:2)). Gautama’s betrayal of his reception es-
pecially denotes his corrupted self, and provides the ethical backdrop
to his transition from servicing needs to satisfying wants.
Gautama’s consumption by his own greed, as he ‘gives in’ to his
adopted bandit (dasyu) self, is especially apparent on his return to the
crane’s tree, fully laden with wealth from the demon-lord (165.25):
k(cid:8)cchr(cid:2)t samudvahan v(cid:5)ra nyagrodhaü samup(cid:2)gamat|
nyaù(cid:5)dac ca pari(cid:3)r(cid:2)ntaþ kl(cid:2)nta(cid:3) ca kùudhita(cid:3) ca ha||
Bearing [his load of gold] with difficulty, heroic man, he returned to the
fig tree and sank down thoroughly fatigued, exhausted and hungry.
Despite the bird’s subsequent generosity and proper observance of ati-
thip(cid:6)j(cid:2) (165.26-7), Gautama gives in to his ‘desire to kill’ (jigh(cid:2)üsur)
and, with his bird-killing dasyu-like nature asserting itself, kills and
cooks the crane, even though his exhausted condition is clearly due to
his own greed, a fact he acknowledges himself.106 In this act, the tale
can be viewed in counterpoint to the earlier story of the bird who sac-
rificed himself in the fire in order to provide food for the exhausted
hunter.107 The practice of atithip(cid:6)j(cid:2) is a prominent motif in both sto-
ries. But while in the earlier text the bird’s self-sacrifice is seen as a
supreme act of dharma, and the bandit (dasyu) hunter is embarrassed
into adopting a dharmic path, in the present text the bird’s death is
nothing but a violent, willful violation of all acceptable modes of con-
duct, and the final indication that the Gautama br(cid:3)hman has become
‘dasyufied’. And this violation suggests a further juxtaposition, this
time with the story of Vi(cid:5)v(cid:3)mitra, who, understanding the proper rela-

tionship of his circumstances to dharma through his vij(cid:9)(cid:2)nabala
‘power of discriminating judgement’, eats the dog meat without be-
coming himself like the (cid:3)vapaca. The Gautama br(cid:3)hman is, in con-
trast, durmati, a fool who does not understand that his circumstances
do not mitigate his choices.108
The demon-lord Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa had clearly seen that this br(cid:3)hman was
not what he seemed (not least because Gautama had admitted his de-
filement to him). Thinking on their first meeting that he was a ‘br(cid:3)h-
man only by birth’ (ayaü vai janan(cid:2)d vipraþ), Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa agreed to
help Gautama only because of his friendship with R(cid:3)jadharman
(165.7). Noting the crane’s extended absence, he suspected that the
br(cid:3)hman had killed the bird, since ‘he neglected his recitations and
was deficient in br(cid:3)hmaõic lustre’ (sv(cid:2)dhy(cid:2)yena viyukto hi brahma-
varcasavarjitaþ), and was as ‘vile as a dasyu’ (dasyur iv(cid:2)dhamaþ).109
Yet, there is a sense in which the br(cid:3)hman is even worse than a dasyu.
While he acts the way he does out of choice, the dasyu acts the way he
does because that is the way he is. Indeed, once Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa has had
Gautama executed, the demons (r(cid:2)kùasas) refuse to eat him because
of his ‘bad karma’ (p(cid:2)pakarman) and ‘taint’ (kilbiùa),110 the dasyus
also refuse to eat that ‘evil-doer’ (p(cid:2)pak(cid:2)rin), and even ‘carrion-
eaters’ (kravy(cid:2)d(cid:2)) reject this ‘ungrateful man’ (k(cid:8)taghna) as fit food.
Gautama, having violated the proper limits of the legitimate applica-
tion of (cid:2)paddharma, succumbs to the anxiety that exists on the mar-
gins of (cid:2)paddharma, as of br(cid:3)hmaõic culture in general. He becomes
the very kind of person, in a full ontological sense, that his behaviour
has led him to be (in opposition to his ‘nature’). Hence he is the ex-
pression of the ultimate catastrophe that can befall br(cid:3)hmaõic culture,
a catastrophe that (cid:2)paddharma is in part designed to address, but
which, paradoxically, it can also bring about through its injudicious
application.
Some of these themes, and other broader elements pertaining to this
narrative, are reflected in the names and descriptive terms used to re-
fer to its two principal characters. The br(cid:3)hman, for instance, is almost
always referred to as Gautama. This is not his personal name so much
as the name of his gotra; he is a descendent in the great lineage that
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)

110 166.18 and 20 respectively.
CODA 401
begins with the venerable (cid:8)ùi Gotama. Undoubtedly, this usage of his
gotra title rather than any personal name is pointed, serving to under-
line his betrayal of its tradition. If this is not clear enough, a recurring
motif in the fable is for the br(cid:3)hman to be questioned about his gotra,
reiterating the traditional values such a lineage embodies.111 Each
chapter of the text describes the br(cid:3)hman’s movement from one spa-
tial setting to another. At various stages he is either on a path to some-
where, lost off a path, or running from or returning to a specific set-
ting. This to-ing and fro-ing stands as a metaphor for the br(cid:3)hman’s
falling away from his only true path, represented, of course, by his old
friend from his student days, and which itself is inscribed in the only
name he is given, Gautama, the name of his gotra, standing as a meto-
nym for ‘tradition’.
The crane, on the other hand, is referred to in ways that suggest a
number of different associations. His personal name, N(cid:3)ó(cid:8)jaïgha, oc-
curs just once (163.18) and means ‘stalk-shanks’,112 and hence is a
literal reference to the appearance of the long-legged crane. Occasion-
ally he is also called bakar(cid:2)ja, ‘the king of cranes’ (163.18; 166.2;
167.2, 5). His most common epithet, however, is R(cid:3)jadharman, clearly
reflecting that this is the last unit of the specifically royal instructions,
i.e. r(cid:2)jadharma (incorporating both the RDhP and (cid:2)DhP). Indeed, the
killing of R(cid:3)jadharman perhaps even symbolises the end of the (cid:6)P’s
royal instructions.113 Taken literally, it might be understood simply as
‘King Dharma’ (as Fitzgerald translates it). Or, if the second member
of the compound, -dharman, is interpreted as retaining some sense of
the word’s root ((cid:2)dh(cid:8)),114 maybe as ‘supporter, bearer, of the king’
(one thinks here of the complementary role of br(cid:3)hmans and kings).
Or, it could also be understood in the sense of ‘having the character or
quality of a king’, evoking the ‘royal’ connotations of bakar(cid:2)ja. But
perhaps most significantly, ‘R(cid:3)jadharman’ echoes Yudhiùñhira’s
common epithet as Dharmar(cid:2)ja (the epithet also of Yama, the king of
death), an association that can be developed further. When Yudhi-
ùñhira assumes the disguise of a br(cid:3)hman in the Vir(cid:2)ñaparvan, he takes
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
111 164.7; 165.2-3. And the gotra of his wife in 165.4, who we know, of course, is
actually a (cid:5)(cid:4)dra.
112 N(cid:3)ó(cid:8)jaïgha is also briefly mentioned in 3.191.9-10. Cf. Fitzgerald, The Mah(cid:2)-
bh(cid:2)rata, vol.7, p.779; Hopkins, Epic Mythology, p.184.

402 CHAPTER NINE
the name Kaïka,115 which is usually understood as ‘heron’, but, fol-
lowing some recent work of Fitzgerald, should probably be under-
stood as a carrion-eating stork,116 a bird of similar appearance to a
crane. And Dharma, Yudhiùñhira’s father, takes the disguise of a crane
(baka) in the Yakùapra(cid:3)na.117 The associations of Yudhiùñhira and
Dharma with these birds have been discussed by Biardeau and Hilte-
beitel, both of whom draw on the connotations of death suggested by
these carrion-eating birds, and their prefiguring of the destruction of
the great battle.118 The associations in this text, however, are perhaps
more benign, serving to draw a connecting line between each of the
characters and their various frames of reference, thereby drawing
Yudhiùñhira within the ambit of the very tale being narrated to him.
Undoubtedly, the connections with Yudhiùñhira, and the different
ways of understanding the title ‘R(cid:3)jadharman’, place the crane in rela-
tionship with kingship and dharma, suggesting certain royal significa-
tions. Indeed, one could easily imagine that his reception of Gautama
is a good model for the proper royal attitude to br(cid:3)hmans, while his
lack of recognition of Gautama’s k(cid:8)taghna nature also serves to cau-
tion the king.
But, further reflecting his doubling of Yudhiùñhira, R(cid:3)jadharman
has certain associations with br(cid:3)hmans as well. One might note, in this
respect, the possible sense of ‘R(cid:3)jadharman’ as ‘supporter, bearer, of
the king’ as discussed earlier, which suggests the complementary roles
of br(cid:3)hmans and kings, particularly in regard to the merit a properly
acting br(cid:3)hman brings to the king (and his kingdom) who protects
him. In his regular visits to both Brahm(cid:3) and Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa (his benefac-
tor who protects him), he is also acting more like a br(cid:3)hman than a
king. In some ways, therefore, he can be viewed as the antithesis of
the Gautama br(cid:3)hman, an antithesis strengthened by the fact that R(cid:3)ja-
dharman is a bird, and as such a dvija, ‘twice-born’, though he is re-

ferred to in this way just once in the text (163.21).119 Dvija, of course,
is also a term used for all three upper classes, but especially a br(cid:3)h-
man, and indeed it is the most common term (numbering 26) used for
br(cid:3)hmans in this text, with Gautama accounting for 11 of these, as if
to emphasise the juxtaposition between this twice-born bird-killer and
the twice-born bird.120 Just like Gautama, R(cid:3)jadharman is also de-
scended from a venerable (cid:8)ùi, Ka(cid:5)yapa. And his mother, who brings
him back to life, is the divine cow Surabhi, the daughter of Dakùa.121
While Gautama is the example of the k(cid:8)taghna, who ‘destroys what
has been done (for him)’, the ungrateful man who (literally, as it turns
out) bites the hand that feeds him and betrays the legacy of his line-
age, R(cid:3)jadharman embodies its antonym;122 he is k(cid:8)taj(cid:9)a, the grateful
man ‘who knows what has been done’, who acts with trust because he
understands the benefits it brings, and who is a good and loyal friend
to Gautama and Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa,123 which leads to the latter’s largesse to the
former (despite Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa’s misgivings), and whose felicity to the
legacy of his lineage, in the end, saves him. It is R(cid:3)jadharman’s loy-
alty, and his understanding of ‘what had been done’, that prompts him
to have Gautama restored to life, since in his killing of R(cid:3)jadharman
he was only acting under the volition of a vengeful god (Brahm(cid:3)—see
the summary of the tale above). In this act of self-abnegation, a denial
of any sense of the injustice meted out to him by Gautama, he once
again emphatically juxtaposes himself to that cruel and misguided
br(cid:3)hman.
Though the narrative contained in this unit is employed to illustrate
the characteristics of a k(cid:8)taghna, a man who destroys the trust estab-
lished between two people through mutually beneficial activity, two
significant subtexts embed it in the broader narrative concerns of the
(cid:2)DhP, the narrative functioning in both cases as a cautionary tale.
Firstly, Bh(cid:8)ùma’s opening analysis, and to a lesser extent his closing

121 Dakùa had many daughters, a number of whom were married to Ka(cid:5)yapa, be-
coming the mothers of the gods, demons, men and animals.
122 Viewed differently, Gautama and Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa may be understood to manifest
each respective antonym, Gautama k(cid:8)taghna and Vir(cid:4)pakùa k(cid:8)taj(cid:9)a. Gautama would
demonstrate the kind of person who shouldn’t be allied with, Vir(cid:4)p(cid:3)kùa who should
be.

summary, frames the fable in the political terms of alliances, allies and
enemies. Secondly, much of the momentum of the narrative is driven
by the concerns that especially typify the crisis a br(cid:3)hman faces when
his livelihood is threatened, that is to say, a situation in which (cid:2)pad-
dharma might be expected to apply. Even if, therefore, the text has
been included as the result of ‘later’ (as indeterminate as this temporal
marker is) redactorial activity, in recapitulating some of the central
themes of the (cid:2)DhP, the person or people responsible for its inclusion
were clearly conscious of the broader dynamics of the encompassing
narrative context. Just as this is a cautionary tale for a br(cid:3)hman who
undertakes extreme activities when neither the time nor the place mer-
its them, so it is an appropriate warning for a king who seeks alli-
ances. Entering into an alliance with the wrong man (k(cid:8)taghna) invites
disaster; entering into an alliance with the right man (k(cid:8)taj(cid:9)a) gener-
ates untold benefits.

CHAPTER TEN
CONCLUSION
A tendency to concentrate on the Mbh as ‘epos’ (that is to say, as he-
roic narrative), and concomitantly relegate the didactic corpora to an-
cillary status at best, or to completely exclude them at worst, has re-
sulted in a skewed focus in Mbh studies. In all but a few cases—and
with the BhG being a notable exception—there has been a failure to
appreciate the distinctive contributions that the didactic corpora make
to the Mbh, as well as the distinctive qualities of the didactic corpora
as units in themselves. Without attempting to move beyond the meth-
ods and conclusions of an analytical technique, whose interpretive
framework equates ‘early’ with ‘original’ and ‘unity’ with ‘uniform-
ity’ and inevitably historicises contradiction and juxtaposition, the
object of Mbh scholarship will always be something other than the
Mbh. This book has tackled the (cid:2)DhP with a view to explaining the
importance of its position in the unfolding didactic narrative of the (cid:6)P,
and understanding and describing its integrity as a unit. This approach
has not ignored the problems that the (cid:2)DhP poses for the history of
the production and redaction of the Mbh, but merely refused to accept
that such problems are the only questions of interest for Mbh studies
in regard to the didactic corpora.
The poetic integrity of the (cid:2)DhP—despite its imperfections and
overt didacticism—belies the negative assessment and general neglect
of the Mbh’s didactic corpora typical of much Mbh scholarship. The
commentaries on the semantic units of the (cid:2)DhP in chapters six to
nine of this book clearly demonstrate that each is constructed, with
varying degrees of care, around the interaction of framing and framed
elements. Furthermore, the syntactic structure of the (cid:2)DhP clearly
responds to its broader context in the (cid:6)P, between the RDhP and the
MDhP. The consistent employment of a repertoire of poetic devices
and narrative strategies—such as the interlocutory system, the rhe-
torical features that constitute this system, the recollection of epic
events, the utilisation of particular narrative forms, and a portrayal of
character consistent with that established elsewhere in the Mbh—indi-
cates a redactorial agency deeply conscious of the (cid:2)DhP’s position
within the broader narrative parameters of the (cid:6)P and the Mbh, and,
406 CHAPTER TEN
indeed, an agency utilising this context for its own poetic and discur-
sive purposes.
Many questions relating to the (cid:2)DhP still remain to be answered,
both in terms of its individual components and its position, function
and interrelationships with the broader context of the Mbh, an issue
this book has broached for the most part only in terms of its place in
the (cid:6)P. While I have twice alluded to the dynastic crises marking the
onset of the Mbh story—resulting in Vy(cid:3)sa’s fathering of heirs on
Vicitrav(cid:8)rya’s widows and Kunt(cid:8)’s use of a boon to impel various
gods to take her husband P(cid:3)õóu’s place and beget her chil-
dren—which is framed in terms of the concept of niyoga,1 a key com-
ponent of (cid:2)paddharma, one might wonder what other cogent thematic
intersections exist between the (cid:2)DhP and the Mbh. To what extent (if
any) does an ‘(cid:2)paddharma semantic’ frame the entire Mbh? And to
what degree are such matters related to the articulation of a parvan
dedicated to (cid:2)paddharma? Such questions must await future research.
Concrete indications of the identity of the (cid:2)DhP’s redactor(s) are
lost to the historical record. Yet, it has been the assumption of this
book that, by considering the (cid:2)DhP’s texts against the background of
related Indian intellectual and textual traditions, it is possible to per-
suasively mount arguments for the intellectual interests that were
likely to have motivated the collecting of the (cid:2)DhP’s texts into a co-
hesive unit. Accordingly, I have attempted to describe these interests
in terms of a political need for a king to come to terms with situations
of crisis, and a need for individuals to find a means of livelihood in
cases where a crisis has rendered their doctrinally dictated occupations
difficult to pursue. The former situation is paradigmatically depicted
in the classic Indian treatise on political affairs, the Artha(cid:3)(cid:2)stra, while
the paradigm for the latter is found in the dharma-s(cid:6)tras and -(cid:3)(cid:2)stras.
It is within the typical concerns of the latter group of texts that the
compound (cid:2)paddharma was most likely coined—to refer to ideas de-
veloped at least as far back as the earliest dharmas(cid:6)tras—as part of a
broad conceptual trend that saw the word dharma assume a central
position in arguments over legitimate behaviour. Yet, it is of some
surprise that the texts of the (cid:2)DhP typically concern political prob-
lems, most especially the ‘core’ (cid:2)paddharma texts between SUs 1-12,
and hence they share a close topical relationship with the KA. It seems
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
1 See above pp.1f. and 328ff.; and for niyoga, above p.49.
CONCLUSION 407
likely, therefore, that the collecting together of these politically focus-
sed texts, was, in part, motivated by a desire to seek legitimacy for the
concerns of these texts in terms of dharma, via the notion of (cid:2)pad-
dharma, a concept encoding ‘legitimate conduct in times of distress’.
The intellectual interests of the redactors of the (cid:2)DhP and the po-
etic form in which they chose to present these texts—that is to say, as
a cohesive unit embedded in the broad instructional corpus of the (cid:6)P,
which, in turn, is embedded in the great sm(cid:8)ti of the Mbh—come to-
gether in what, in my view, is the clearest discursive purpose of the
(cid:2)DhP, the re-articulation of a br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship in terms of
dharma, a word encoding—in the intersecting currents of the broader
Indian tradition (incorporating Buddhism, Jainism, Br(cid:3)hmaõism, (nas-
cent) Hinduism, etc.), to which the br(cid:3)hmaõic interests of the (cid:2)DhP
must have felt compelled to respond—legitimacy, morality and ethical
conduct. This br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship is little different from that
represented in texts like the KA and the MS, and involves the respect-
ful treatment of br(cid:3)hmans, and, especially, the necessary (and, at
times, oppressive) use of force to ensure the well-being of the king-
dom and the place of br(cid:3)hmans within it. By presenting the interests
that are reflected in the texts of the (cid:2)DhP within the Mbh, the dual
discursive goal is met of granting these texts the persuasive authority
the Mbh incorporates in its designation as sm(cid:8)ti, as well as whatever
popular currency the Mbh enjoyed as a well-known tale of a dynastic
struggle that is at once glorious and horrifying. Thus this articulation
of a br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship yields to a political reality in the mar-
ket place of ideas, utilising, as one of its means of persuasion, the pri-
mary ethical concept of the times, dharma, by now no longer (if ever
it was) the sole preserve of br(cid:3)hmaõic orthodoxy.
In the light of the discursive representation of the texts of the (cid:2)DhP
as ‘Mah(cid:2)bh(cid:2)rata’, I shall close with a final reflection on the role of
the question and the questioner, who, in this case, is chiefly Yudhi-
ùñhira. In Jauss’ taxonomy of literary questions, the conception of the
didactic question, as discussed in section 5.3, is contrasted with an-
other, the ‘impudent question’, which ‘calls into question’ received
truths, and, in Jauss’ words, “allows one to enter the realm of taboo”.2
If Jauss’ conception of the impudent question has a counterpart in the
Mbh, it is clearly in the figure of the questioning Yudhiùñhira, par-
(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3239)(cid:3)
2 Jauss, Question and Answer, p.71.
408 CHAPTER TEN
ticularly as he is represented in the early chapters of the (cid:6)P, where he
‘places into question’ the fundamental moral value of the br(cid:3)hmaõic
conception of kingship and its relationship to dharma. Yudhiùñhira
enters the ‘realm of taboo’ by suggesting the inadequacy of conserva-
tive br(cid:3)hmaõic conceptions of dharma, and dares to consider a hetero-
dox alternative to this br(cid:3)hmaõic tradition. Undoubtedly, Yudhi-
ùñhira’s impudence and moral absolutism was designed to represent
contemporary sentiments—among, perhaps, Buddhists, disaffected
br(cid:3)hmans, reforming princes or any number of social groups and
movements expressing dissatisfaction with the ideologies of a conser-
vative Br(cid:3)hmaõism. Yet, in the course of the royal instructions of the
(cid:6)P’s didacticism, Yudhiùñhira’s initial impudence becomes pro-
gressively sublimated. If the (cid:2)DhP’s texts incorporate a re-
articulation of a br(cid:3)hmaõic view of kingship, which legitimises politi-
cally motivated violence for the benefit of a br(cid:3)hmaõically constituted
society, then, as the impudent questions of the post-war Yudhiùñhira
are progressively transmuted into didactic questions, as he himself
‘cools off’, Yudhiùñhira’s questions assume a somewhat different dis-
cursive function. No longer showing much trace of the ‘original’ ta-
boo-testing impudence lying somewhere beneath his questioning,
Yudhiùñhira’s questions—br(cid:3)hmaõically authored and ‘authorised’—
fulfil the requirements demanded by a predetermined set of didactic
monologues, which signal, as Yudhiùñhira assumes his proper role and
duty as king, the final triumph of br(cid:3)hmaõic persuasion.
