Introduction
In the Maha¯bha¯rata, the story of Sa¯vitr¯ı is told by the .r.si Ma¯rkan.d.eya, in seven chapters
(3.277–283),inresponsetothefollowingquestionvoicedbyYudhis.t.hiraPa¯n.d.ava:
astis¯ımantin¯ıka¯cidd.r.s.tapu¯rva¯thava¯´sruta¯ |

Has anyone before ever seen or heard of such a woman as this daughter of Drupada [that is,
Draupad¯ı],sonobleandsointentonservingherhusbands?
Maha¯bha¯rata3.277:3,tr.Smith2009,p.215
Accordingly, in Indian history and elsewhere, the story of Sa¯vitr¯ı – which is illustrated
on a sculptural panel from a now ruined temple to S´iva near the village of Ba¯gh1 – has
served as a paradigmatic story of devoted wifehood. It functions in this way when it is
mentionedintheRa¯ma¯yan.aandnarratedinvariousPura¯n.as;2 andinhiseighteenth-century

In her study of the Str¯ıdharmapaddhati, Julia Leslie summarises the Maha¯bha¯rata’s Sa¯vitr¯ı
story:
Sa¯vitr¯ıisborntoKingA´svapatioftheMadrapeople,bythegraceofthegoddessSa¯vitr¯ı,after
he has offered oblations with the sa¯vitr¯ı formula regularly for eighteen years. When she grows
up,sincenomanaskstomarryher,A´svapatisendsheronapilgrimagetofindahusband.She
chooses Satyavat, who lives with his mother and blind father in exile in the forest. Although
Sa¯vitr¯ılearnsthatheisdoomedtodiewithinayear,shemarrieshimanywayandjoinstheexiled
family. As the day of his death approaches, Sa¯vitr¯ı undertakes the severe tapas of standing day
andnightforthreedays.Onthefourthday,sheaccompaniesherhusbandintotheforest.When
SatyavatcollapsesandYamacomestotakehissoulaway,Sa¯vitr¯ıfollows,answeringYamawith

The prohibitive words, absent from the final boon-offering speech, are vina¯ (satyavato) asya
j¯ıvitam: “except for his (Satyavat’s) life”. (The word punah. in the second and third speeches
justmeans“again”.)
Why does Yama eventually offer a boon without stipulating that the return of Satyavat’s
life is prohibited? That is the dramatic question. From one angle the joke is on Yama, for
beingcareless.
Once Yama has granted Sa¯vitr¯ı and Satyavat the boon of a hundred sons, it may seem
that when granting further boons he cannot reasonably prohibit Satyavat’s revival.5 But
the boon of a hundred sons for Sa¯vitr¯ı, made as it is while Satyavat is still dead, evokes a
situation mentioned by Kunt¯ı at 1.112, when she tells Pa¯n.d.u the story of Vyus.ita¯´sva and
Bhadra¯. Vyus.ita¯´sva died, but Bhadra¯ mourned most effectively over her husband’s corpse,
thuswinningtheboon–inthisinstance,fromthedeadhusbandhimself–ofbearingsons
by him even though he was dead. So she had three S´a¯lva sons and four Madra sons (tr¯ın˜
´sa¯lva¯m.´s caturo madra¯n suta¯n, 1.112:33). Though Kunt¯ı’s story adverts to the necrophilia of
the a´svamedha rite (Hiltebeitel 2011, pp. 275–277), it also links to Sa¯vitr¯ı – whose father is
a Madra and whose husband is a S´a¯lva – and implies that it could be possible for Sa¯vitr¯ı to
haveSatyavat’ssonswithoutSatyavatbeingrevived.
If Yama really wants Satyavat to stay dead, he is careless in omitting, fifth time around,
the prohibition of Satyavat’s revival. But what else can he do? Sa¯vitr¯ı has discovered how
to make Yama offer her any boon except Satyavat’s life, and she has made it clear that she
is not willing to let him leave with Satyavat’s soul without doing whatever she can to stop
him.6 The only way Yama might get away with Satyavat’s soul is to change his policy on
boon-granting, ignore Sa¯vitr¯ı’s next salvo of verses, and just keep heading south. But it
seemsthathisdivineintegritywillnotallowhimsuddenlytoremainunmovedbySa¯vitr¯ı’s

TheStoryofSa¯vitr¯ıintheMaha¯bha¯rata 531
Fromthisperspective,thenarrativenecessityforSatyavat’sfathertobeblind,forexample,
or for him to have recently lost his kingdom, could potentially be explained simply by the
storyteller’s desire to give Sa¯vitr¯ı some more things to ask for before Yama eventually gives
in. But this would be a misjudgement, because, as I will show, Satyavat’s father’s blindness
and loss of kingdom are significant details within the stereotyped lineal situation that the
storyshowcases:thesituationwherebytwopatrilineseachneedason,butthereisonlyone
son to go round. Nonetheless, it is worth keeping in mind that the story is told in broad
strokessuchthat,initspivotalscene,anumberofemblematicproblemscanberemediedall

Sa¯vitr¯ı the putrika¯
Consider Sa¯vitr¯ı’s relationship with her father’s patriline. According to the norm presented

ButSa¯vitr¯ı’sfather,KingA´svapati,hadnosons;andbeforeSa¯vitr¯ıwasbornheundertook
an eighteen-year vow in the hope of having some. This vow included recitation of the

The brotherless maiden is something of a legend in old Sanskrit literature:9 keen for a

The reason given for the lack of male interest in Sa¯vitr¯ı is that potential partners were
“wardedoffby[her]brilliance”(tejasa¯prativa¯ritah.,3.277:27).DespiteJamison’sparenthetical
commentthat“manymodernwomenwillrecognizethisplight”(Jamison1996,p.245),it
seemstomeratherunlikelythatSa¯vitr¯ıwastooglorioustobewooed.Itakethisexplanation
as something of a joke, with a nice pun to boot (the verb v.r meaning ‘ward off’ as well as
‘choose in marriage’), and instead I follow Jamison’s endnoted suggestion that: “As she is
also the only child of A´svapati, her potential status of ‘appointed daughter’ may have put
peopleoffaswell,thoughthisobstacleisnotmentionedinthestory”(Jamison1996,p.305

Dyumatsena’s blindness
Given how precious Satyavat is for King Dyumatsena’s line, why would Dyumatsena allow
him to marry an only daughter? From one perspective the answer would be: because
otherwisethesituationwouldnotbesodramaticandparadigmatic.Butintermsofnarrative
content,thereisnosuggestionthatDyumatsenaandhiswifeappreciatethedangertheyare
in. A´svapati takes Sa¯vitr¯ı with him and goes to visit Dyumatsena to give Sa¯vitr¯ı away, and
Dyumatsena receives them with every courtesy, agrees to the match, and even says, at the
endofthedialogue,thathehadalwayshopedtoestablishamarriagealliancewithA´svapati’s
family.ButheexpressesconcernthatSa¯vitr¯ımightnotliketherigoursofforestlife,andthat
sincehisfamilyhasfallenonhardtimes,theyareperhapsnotthemostdesirablein-laws.
During this brief exchange (3.279:8–14) Dyumatsena expresses reservations concerning
the match, but these fail to dissuade A´svapati from his intention. It is hard to tell whether
Dyumatsena is just being modest and polite, or whether he actually wants to avoid this
marriage; but in any case, the question of whose lineage the offspring will support is not
raised, so if A´svapati has Sa¯vitr¯ı in mind as his putrika¯, he is keeping his cards close to his
chest,andifDyumatsenahasanyfearsonthatscore,hekeepsquietaboutthem.Dyumatsena
isalreadyacquaintedwithA´svapati’sfamilytosomeextent,soperhapshewouldknowthat
Sa¯vitr¯ıisanonlychild;orperhapshedoesnotknowthis.
If it seems as though Dyumatsena is rather precipitous in agreeing to the marriage, he
isblind!Sa¯vitr¯ıhasalreadytoldNa¯radaandA´svapatithatwhileDyumatsenawasrulinghis
S´a¯lva realm he became blind, and in his hour of weakness he was deposed and exiled by
“a neighbour whowas an oldenemy”(sa¯m¯ıpyena ... pu¯rvavairin.a¯,3.278:8, tr.Smith 2009,

HerewecancomparetheblindDhr.tara¯s.t.ra–theuncleanduncle-in-lawofthePa¯n.d.avas
and Draupad¯ı, who are listening to the story. As is clear from the various remonstrations
of Vidura, Sam.jaya and several others, as well as being physically blind, Dhr.tara¯s.t.ra is blind
to the likely consequences of his decisions and actions (see Hudson 2007); and in this he
resemblesDyumatsena.Inbothcasestheblindnessbearsuponthebusinessofthecharacter’s

Dyumatsena’s loss of kingdom
Like the lineal drama between Dhr.tara¯s.t.ra’s sons and Pa¯n.d.u’s, the lineal drama between
Dyumatsena’s line and A´svapati’s is enhanced by the fact that both families are royal. The
necessityforanykingtoarrangehissonasthenextking,andthustoarrangehisfamily’s(and
his realm’s) lineal succession, makes stories of royal families particularly well suited to the
playingoutoflinealproblematicsinmoreorlessstereotypedforms;andthisiswhatwesee

the unnamed ‘old enemy’, who has deposed Dyumatsena and appropriated his kingdom,
to be A´svapati himself. Either way, interpretively adjusting the chronology would allow
Dyumatsena to lose his kingdom as a consequence of accepting the poisoned gift that is
Sa¯vitr¯ı. The magical manner in which Sa¯vitr¯ı solves Dyumatsena’s and Satyavat’s problems

Inthinkingaboutthisissue,onewonderswhetherreligiousstudiescommentatorsmight
perhapshavebeenratherslowtothinkthroughproperlytheeffectsofsuchmagicalepisodes
upon the ancient audience. The reason why the story of Yama magically granting specific
boons looks tall to us is because it is, in those details, a very tall story; it surely anticipates
beingseenassuch,anditthusanticipatesinterpretivespeculation.
Sa¯vitr¯ı the pativrata¯, and Yama’s boons revisited
Once Sa¯vitr¯ı is married, the narrative shows her behaving like a model patrilineal wife
to an extraordinary degree; a romantic ideal of sorts. But Ray suggests that “the first
authorstotypecastSa¯vitr¯ıinaromanticlightwerethecolonialists,nationalistsandEuropean

romanticists” (Ray, 2006, p. 23); and Weiss, reviewing scholarship on Sa¯vitr¯ı, says that:
“In western ideology, the ideal of female fidelity and subservience is well defined, and its
correspondence to the Hindu ideal seems to obviate the necessity for in-depth analysis”
(Weiss 1985, p. 261). Nonetheless, it is right and proper for Sa¯vitr¯ı to be seen as a model
pativrata¯,becausetobecomethisfromhersituationasanintendedputrika¯israreandspecial,
andbecausealthoughshenodoubtdoesitinresponsetohernewfamily,shedoesiteffectively

boons.16
IfwefollowthesuggestedinterpretationofDyumatsena’slossofsightandkingdom,the

of sequence, since by this later point everything has, in principle, been solved. But in this
delayedmoment,DyumatsenaandhiswifeS´aibya¯ areindeedworrying;theyhavebecome
convincedofSatyavat’spossibledeath,andtheyaretrawlingthea¯´sramaslookingfornews.
Dyumatsena–whocannowsee–criesinanguish:“Ah,myson,ah,mygooddaughter-
in-law, where are you, where are you?” (ha¯ putra ha¯ sa¯dhvi vadhu¯h. kva¯si kva¯s¯ıty, 3.282:9, tr.
Smith 2009, p. 230). The sentiment matches the scene very well, but the scene – and the
whole sequence between the granting of the boons and the young couple’s arrival home
– might seem rather narratively gratuitous, or even a bit perverse; it is a new tack to the
story,andisomittedinLeslie’ssummarypresentedearlier.Nonetheless,theparents-in-law’s
son-hunting a¯´srama-tour parallels Sa¯vitr¯ı’s husband-hunting t¯ırtha-tour near the beginning
of the story. Also, it fits very well in allowing a displaced and delayed presentation of the
existentialmomentbeforeSa¯vitr¯ıreinventsherself–withDyumatsena,S´aibya¯ andSatyavat
allsuffering,separatelyandtogether.
Many new characters also appear in this extra section of the story: Suvarcas, Gautama,
his pupil, the.r.sis, Bha¯radva¯ja, Da¯lbhya, Ma¯n.d.avya and Dhaumya. The association of these
characters with Sa¯vitr¯ı’s switch from the putrika¯ to the pativrata¯ mode is underlined at this
juncture by their telling the worried old couple in no uncertain terms, in sequence one
after another in various ways, that Satyavat is still alive (3.282:10–19); and only then do
Satyavat andSa¯vitr¯ıturnupandproveit,andexplainwhytheyaresolateback. Wemight
infer that these.r.sis supported Sa¯vitr¯ı’s revolution against the putrika¯ method; and it is here
that we see “a socio-political message of vast proportions, seeking to invalidate all other
versions of femininity” (Ray 2006, p. 23). The .r.sis certainly congratulate Sa¯vitr¯ı on her
deeds:“Thelineofthekingwassinkinginalakeofdarkness,overcomebydisasters,when
it was saved by you” (nimajjama¯nam. vyasanair abhidrutam. kulam. narendrasya tamomaye hrade |
tvaya¯ ... samuddh.rtam.,3.282:43,tr.Smith2009,p.232).
WenowhearhowDyumatsena’skingdomisregainedaccordingtothesurfacestory:the

flees, and a party comes to find Dyumatsena and invite him back to his old realm. Then
Sa¯vitr¯ıhasahundredsons,andsodoeshermotherMa¯lav¯ı.
And so A´svapati has a hundred sons. The solution to A´svapati’s lineal crisis, after his
daughterSa¯vitr¯ıswitchessides,seemssimpleandelegant–somuchsothatwewonderagain
whatitwasthatpreventeditearlier,andmeantSa¯vitr¯ıhadtobeaputrika¯ inthefirstplace.

isnotclearthatthethirdboonhasreallysolvedthisproblem.
If we review our earlier speculation that the takeover of the kingdom by Dyumatsena’s
neighbour might have represented A´svapati and his putrika¯ trick, we can extend our
speculations to the identity of the neighbour’s murderous minister (ama¯tya, 3.283:3). One
possibility might be to identify this minister as a representation of Sa¯vitr¯ı. A better option
mightbetoidentifyhimasA´svapati’sfather-in-law,theMa¯lavaking.

538 SimonBrodbeck
Regardlessofthisdetail,theconsequenceofA´svapati’slinealsonlessnesshasbeenaverted
within Dyumatsena’s line. The main point of the story is that a woman’s father should not
take her sons for his own line; but also shown quite clearly now, in retrospect, is that one
of the reasons why he might want to do so is because his own son is not lineally his own.
ThisconsequencemeansthatdespitethefactthatnodaughterofDyumatsenaismentioned,
we can imagine putrika¯ usage spreading in a rippling chain through a wide community of
possibleintermarriage,unlessitischeckedatsomepoint.
In this story, the consequence of putrika¯ usage is checked by the disciplined resolve of
Sa¯vitr¯ı. And this female fulcrum can suggest a third, even more preferable representational
identity for Dyumatsena’s neighbour’s murderous minister – to wit: A´svapati’s wife Ma¯lav¯ı.
In any case, if we have been given a glimpse of the infectious nature of putrika¯ usage, we
arealsoencouragedtoimaginethesimilarcounter-infectiousconsequenceofwomenbeing
lineally pativrata¯, through their sons, to their husbands. By being pativrata¯ in this way, such

So eventually, some time after hearing about Sa¯vitr¯ı, the Pa¯n.d.avas fight the war at
Kuruks.etra as much to try to restore Draupad¯ı’s honour as to regain their lost realm. But
when all is said and done, although the kingdom can be won back, there is no remedy for
Draupad¯ı’s disgrace. How can the next king after Yudhis.t.hira Dharmara¯ja be born from a

TheStoryofSa¯vitr¯ıintheMaha¯bha¯rata 541
Katzsays,“allnamedvictimsofthenightraidarePa¯n˜ca¯las”;“someoneisgettingridofthe
Pa¯n˜ca¯lastomakewayforanotherPa¯n.d.avaheir”(Katz1991,pp.133,135).
Following the suggestive leads of several other scholars, I have elsewhere argued that
the suppression of the putrika¯ possibility is dramatised in Vedic literature by the story of
S´iva’s killing the Praja¯pati who mated with his own daughter, and that the Maha¯bha¯rata’s
repeatedstoryofS´iva’swreckingDaks.a’ssacrificeisatransformationofthatVedicstoryand
adramatisationofthesamesuppression(Brodbeck2009a,pp.52–55,90–95;Brodbeck2012,

Hiltebeiteldetailstheseparallelsunder14headings;somearemoreconvincingthanothers,

of these parallels is peripheral to our present concerns, but the connection he establishes
betweenthetwostoriesisvital.Insymbolicterms–andthisfitswithDraupad¯ı’sdisgraceas
discussedabove–wethusseeafirmconnectionbetweenDaks.aandDrupada,eventhough
thereisnoexplicitsuggestionthatDraupad¯ıwasintendedtobeaputrika¯.
IftheDraupad¯ınarrativeturnsupontheviolentdestructionofherfather’sline,thisturning
point is presented in the Sa¯vitr¯ı story in terms of Sa¯vitr¯ı’s loyal dedication to her husband
and his line. Also, and relatedly, whereas in Draupad¯ı’s case the destruction is initiated by
A´svattha¯man (who has his own motives), Sa¯vitr¯ı mounts the heroic stand herself. This last
difference can be closed up if we consider Kr.s.n.a¯ Draupad¯ı not as a single autonomous
character, but as a functional aspect of a dark force that operates through her as well as
through Kr.s.n.a Va¯sudeva and Kr.s.n.a Dvaipa¯yana Vya¯sa.22 If Draupad¯ı eschews the putrika¯
possibility by suffering the destruction of her father’s line as effected by S´iva, she facilitates
thefurtheringofherhusbands’line,inUttara¯’sdeliveryroom,intheguiseofhernamesake
Kr.s.n.a.23 Pariks.it’s stillbirth (14.65) can be seen as a representation of the death-by-putrika¯
thatthePa¯n.d.avalinecouldhavesuffered(anditislinkedbacktothemassacreofthePa¯n˜ca¯las
throughA´svattha¯man’scurse);butKr.s.n.aintervenes,ashesaidhewould(at10.16:15).Like
Sa¯vitr¯ı, Kr.s.n.a gets the better of death, reviving the endangered line through the power of
his discipline and dharma. He uses an ‘act of truth’, a miracle technique employed in the
Maha¯bha¯ratausuallybywomen:24

overshadowedbythechoiceofwhichlinewillsurvive,thelineofthehusbandorthelineofthefather.InSa¯vitr¯ı’s

The parallel thus formed between the Sa¯vitr¯ı story and the story of the Pa¯n.d.ava line is
underlined by Sa¯vitr¯ı’s performance of an ‘act of truth’ after Satyavat has come back to life
and has expressed concern that his parents will be worried. We know, as Sa¯vitr¯ı does, that
all danger is already past, provided no one accidentally dies of worry; but the sentiment is
encapsulatory.

In this way, the comparison between Sa¯vitr¯ı and Kr.s.n.a¯ Draupad¯ı comes down to Kr.s.n.a in

Conclusion
In this paper I have argued for a lineal interpretation of the Maha¯bha¯rata’s Sa¯vitr¯ı story,
wherebySa¯vitr¯ıwasintendedtobeaputrika¯dedicatedtoherfather’sline.Satyavat’sdeathas
wellasDyumatsena’sblindnessandlossofkingdomhavebeenexplainedintheseterms,and
Sa¯vitr¯ı’svictoryoverYamahasbeendeemedtorepresentherswitchfrombeingaputrika¯ to
beingapativrata¯,withunfortunateresultsforherfather.Manydetailsofthestoryhavebeen
well explained by this interpretation, and other details unmentioned here could perhaps
be similarly explained. I have offered a reading of the final phase of the story consonant
with this theme, and I have shown how the theme and some important structural features
of the story transfer, via Draupad¯ı with whom Sa¯vitr¯ı is compared, to the wider story of
thePa¯n.d.avas,thusprovidinganewperspectiveonDraupad¯ı’schequeredreputation,onthe
nightmassacre,andonPariks.it’srevival.
In terms of Maha¯bha¯rata studies, one effect of these discussions has been to show that
denying the putrika¯ possibility is a central theme within the text, even if this is not evident
atfirstglance.AnothereffecthasbeentoconsolidateHiltebeitel’sworkontheintegrityof
the Maha¯bha¯rata’s upa¯khya¯nas (‘subtales’; see Hiltebeitel 2005), by showing that the Sa¯vitr¯ı
story is thematically and structurally of a piece with the wider text of which it forms –
perchancealwaysformed–part.Ithushopethatthispaperwillmakeasmallcontribution

Hiltebeitel calls attention to the garments that Arjuna presents to Uttara¯ at 4.64:34–35: “The bestowal of the
garmentsonUttara¯representsthattheir[thePa¯n.d.avas’]rebirthwillbethroughher,ratherthanthroughDraupad¯ı”

offertworice-balls,onetohisfatherandonetohismaternalgrandfather.
Manusm.rti9:131–132,tr.Olivelle2006,pp.196–197
Accordingtothisreading,thesonofaputrika¯feedsbothsidesofhisfamily,whereasat9:140
only the mother’s side is fed. But Olivelle’s translation (as also that of Doniger and Smith
1991, p. 213) is odd, since it apparently presents the same information in two successive
lines(9:131cdand9:132ab).IncontrastBu¨hler’stranslation,followingtheinterpretationof
Medha¯tithi, reads the second of these lines differently, with aputrasya pituh. referring not to
thesonlessfatheroftheputrika¯ buttothesonlessgenitoroftheputrika¯’sson:
Thesonofan(appointed)daughter,indeed,shall(also)taketheestateofhis(own)father,who
leavesno(other)son ...
Manusm.rti9:132ab,tr.Bu¨hler1979,p.353;compareJha1992,vol.2,p.280
In other words, although the son of a putrika¯ might sometimes be replaced by his brother
asfarashisownpatriline’s´sra¯ddharitesareconcerned(andthentwobrotherswould,rather
awkwardly, serve different lines), if his father has no other sons to do this, then the sole
son must feed both lines. I think Bu¨hler’s reading is to be preferred, but in both readings
there is a man who must sustain both of his parental lines; the only difference is over the
circumstances.
Ifinheritanceand´sra¯ddha-dutiesarealwayslinked(seeRocher1992,p.645),thenaman
offering´sra¯ddhatobothsidesofhisfamilywouldalsoinheritfrombothsides;andthiswould
mean that a crown prince wishing to enlarge his realm in the next generation would do

Afinalpointhere:whenManusm.rti9:132saysthatthefatherandthemother’sfatherare
