NOT WITHOUT SUBTALES: TELLING LAWS AND TRUTHS
IN THE SANSKRIT EPICS
This article on India’s two Sanskrit epics, the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata and
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a, will address four topics:1 how they have been defined by
scholars and by themselves; how each conceptualizes the relationship
between its whole and its parts, and particularly its subtales;2 how
subtales figure in their main stories; and how each creates grand
narrative out of this configuration. This article favors the priority of
the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata and will be presented from that standpoint.3
EPIC CUES AND SCHOLARLY VIEWS
The Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata describes itself as ‘‘sprung from the oceanic mind
(manah:sa(cid:1)garasambhu(cid:1)ta(cid:1)m)’’ (1.53.34a) of its author Vy(cid:1)asa and to be
his ‘‘entire thought’’ (1.1.23; 1.55.2) in a text of a hundred thousand
couplets (s(cid:2)lokas) (1.56.13). Although no known edition reaches that
number, when the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata describes texts of that size it denotes
their originary vastness. As one lost prototype,4 it mentions that

tantrasya k:rtsnasya yasma(cid:1)d dharmah: pravartate)’’ (12.322.26d and
36). Even grander, it recalls a ‘‘treatise’’ ((cid:2)sa(cid:1)stra) by Brahm(cid:1)a of
originally one hundred thousand adhya(cid:1)yas or chapters (12.59.29) –
thereareabout2000adhya(cid:1)yasintheMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata7–thatunderwent
fourabridgments:byS´ivato 10,000chapters,Indratofivethousand,
B:rhaspati to three thousand, and K(cid:1)avya Us´anas to one thousand
(59.86–91). Indeed, amid a wider discussion of abridgments in clas-
sical Indian literature, Sylvain Le´vi points out that in claiming
100,000-verses,8 the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata would have come into ‘‘competi-
tion with Buddhism,’’ since the designation ‘‘inevitably calls to our
mind … the S(cid:2)atasahasrika Prajn˜a(cid:1)pa(cid:1)ramita(cid:1). For passing into current
usage the [latter] work must have been submitted to successive
reductions to 25,000, 8000 (a:st:asahasrika, which is the classical form
of the treatise), 700 and 500’’ ([1917] 1918–20, 18–19; slightly modi-
fied).9
To describe the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s magnitude, many also cite a verse
that occurs twice – once near its beginning and once near its end –
that claims, ‘‘Whatever is here may be found elsewhere; what is not
here does not exist anywhere’’ (1.56.33; 18.5.38). One strain of
scholarship takes this verse to suggest that by the time the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata reached its ‘‘extant’’ mass, it would have grown from
6‘‘Loom’’ fortantra,ormore prosaically,perhaps, ‘‘course.’’
7The PuneCritical Editionhas1995‘‘chapters’’ or‘‘lessons’’ (adhya(cid:1)yas).
8 Le´vi seems to suggest that the designation ‘‘hundred thousand-versed’’ ‘‘had
been consecrated since the fifth century,’’ citing its appearance on a fifth century
inscription.ButthatinscriptionwouldbequotingMbh1.56.13and12.331.2,where
theclaimismadeintheepicitself.ThereisnoreasontothinkthattheMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata
number wasreached onlyby thefifth century andannouncedatthat point.
9 Le´vi’s Prajn˜aapa(cid:1)ramita(cid:1) sequencing is uncertain; see Conze (1960). My view
would be that his instinct is likelier for the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, with which the Buddhist
textswouldhave‘‘caughtup.’’OnLe´vi’shypothesis,theS´atasahasrikawouldhave
‘‘lent itself to this process without difficulty: it was only necessary to cut down the
tautologies, the redundancies, and the repetitions which swelled it and gave it an
enormous bulk.… Inits steady effort for the beautiful [or perfect], India has mani-
festly passed through the intermediate stage of the colossal. Before relishing and
realizing thebeautythatconsists inaharmonious equilibrium oflines,the mindof
man first permits itself to be carried away by mere mass’’ ([1917] 1918–20, 19).
Evolutionary claims aside, Le´vi’s conclusion could be said to anticipate what this
article hastosay about themore local stanceofV(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki visa` vis Vy(cid:1)asa.

oral origins into a massive ‘‘encyclopedia’’ – a text of such monu-
mental self-sufficiency that it could have considered itself to have
absorbed everything that would have haphazardly come its way as a
reflexofitssnowballdescentthroughcenturies.10Manysuchscholars
cite another verse in support of this theory, which says that Vy(cid:1)asa
‘‘composedaBha(cid:1)rata-collection(sam: hita(cid:1))of24,000coupletswithout
the subtales (upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nair vina(cid:1)); so much is called Bha(cid:1)rata by the
wise’’ (1.1.61).11 Although a 100,000 verse Bha(cid:1)rata is also mentioned
(12.331.2), translators have sought to help the developmental argu-
ment along by adding that Vy(cid:1)asa composed this shorter version
‘‘first’’ (van Buitenen, 1973, I, 22; cf. Ghosh, 1991, 9) or ‘‘originally’’
(Ganguli [1884–96] 1970, I, 6). But the verse says nothing about
anything coming first. Since ‘‘without’’ implies a subtraction, and
since the passage describes Vy(cid:1)asa’s afterthoughts, the 24,000 verse
Bha(cid:1)rata would probably be a digest or abridgment12 that knowers of
the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata could consult or cite for purposes of performance
10 This approach gained authoritative status in Hopkins ([1901] 1969) and has
recently been slightly refined (bardic background, a post-As´okan first written
redaction, and a normative redaction under the Guptas yielding a ‘‘library’’) in
Fitzgerald 2004b, 52–55, 68–70. For counter-arguments, see Hiltebeitel 2001a: that
the epic wouldhavebeen composed overa shorter period(1–31; also Hiltebeitel in
press-c), with nothing required from the Guptas (2001a, 25–26); and that the term
‘‘encyclopedia’’hasbeenmisleadinglyappliedtotheMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata,particularlywith
referencetothe‘‘Whateverisheremaybefoundelsewhere…’’verse,which,rather
than defining the exhaustiveness of the text, is pitched toward an ‘‘ontological
debate’’ (162–163).
11 Sukthankar illustrates the lengths to which scholars have gone in fitting the
24,000 verse ‘‘Bh(cid:1)arata without upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas’’ into their theories of the text, notably
his theory of Bh:rguization: ‘‘in my opinion we should have no hesitation in con-
cludingthatinourversionoftheMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)ratathereisaconscious–naydeliberate–
stitching together of the Bha(cid:1)rata legends with the Bha(cid:1)rgava stories (author’s italics).
The question how precisely this Bh(cid:1)argava element, which we find concentrated
mostlyin theupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nascameinto thecycleofthe Bh(cid:1)aratalegends…islargely a
matterofspeculation.Evenaccordingtothetraditionalview,itwasnottheworkof
Vy(cid:1)asa, the reputed author of the Mah(cid:1)abh(cid:1)arata, because the diaskeuasts have been
fortunately frank enough to admit that his work, the Bh(cid:1)arata, which originally
consistedmerelyof24,000stanzas,hadnoepisodestospeakof’’(1936,70).Thereis
nothingdemonstrably‘‘traditional’’ aboutthisviewofVy(cid:1)asa,andthefranknessof
the diaskeuastsis a fancy.On ‘‘Bh:rguization,’’seeHiltebeitel (2001a,105–118).
12Shulman([1991]2001),25,asthefirstIknowtohaveseenthefallacyofarguing
that the 24,000-verse ‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata’’ came first, takes the verse to imply that Vy(cid:1)asa
‘‘compressed’’ the 100,000 verses ‘‘by eliminating the various minor stories
(upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na) into amere 24,000verses.’’

from a written text.13 Another passage tells us that the divine Seers
(surar:sis)oncegatheredtoweighthe‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata’’onascaleagainstthe
four Vedas; when the ‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata’’ proved heavier in both size and
weight, the Seers dubbed it the ‘‘Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’’ (1.1.208–9), thereby
providing a double ‘‘etymology’’ (nirukta) forone and the same huge
text.14 Yet despite nothing surviving of this shorter Bha(cid:1)rata, scholars
have used it to argue for an originally oral bardic and heroic story
that would have lacked not only subtales but frame stories, tales
about the author both in the frames and elsewhere, didactic addi-
tions, and devotional passages with ‘‘divinized’’ heroes. Some have
assumed that K:r:sn:a would have been ‘‘divinized’’ before the intro-
ductionofstill‘‘later’’passagesglorifyingS´ivaandeventheGoddess;
and there were even those who wanted to argue that K:r:sn:a was not
original to the earliest bardic version. Although these ideas domi-
nated Western scholarship only in the late 19th and early 20th cen-
turies,theyarestillvigorous.Itis,however,nolongerpossibletofind

epic,andtherearenowthosewhoseeprinciplesofongoingdesignas

13 Fitzgerald still asks ‘‘at what stage was a putative Bha(cid:1)rata story recast as the
‘Maha(cid:1)’Bha(cid:1)rata…?’’(inpress,26),andinafootnotetothiscontinuingquestioncites
‘‘thepurportedhistoricalobservationofVy(cid:1)asaat1.1.61…[as]evidencethatatleast

of the verse in question is where one must begin (as Sukthankar did, claiming that
theoriginal‘‘hadnoepisodestospeakof’’;seen.11above)inconsideringhowthe
epic ‘‘distinguished larger and smaller versions of’’ itself (rather than gratuitously
attributing thedistinction to ‘‘some in ancientIndia,’’implying ‘‘some Brahmans,’’
whom Fitzgerald frequently invokes with the suggestion that sociological divisions
would have produced the textual variations in which he usually sees additions).
Fitzgerald tries to relate 1.1.61 to his argument for centuries of sequential devel-
opment in the composition of Books 12 and 13, and to explain ‘‘sectors’’ of the
Bh(cid:1)argava R(cid:1)ama dossier by associating the Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana and Ugras´ravas frames
withtwoof‘‘four,ormore,distinctpoeticorredactionalefforts’’(2002,115;99–100,
104–107, 112–113) – an opportunistic (I believe) association between frames and
redactions also made by Sukthankar and some others (see Hiltebeitel, 2001a, 105
n. 47andabove n. 11).
14 Cf. 1.56.31: ‘‘The Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, they say, is the great Birth of the Bh(cid:1)aratas
(bha(cid:1)rata(cid:1)na(cid:1)m mahaj janma): he who knows this etymology (nirukta) is rid of all his
sins.’’
NOTWITHOUTSUBTALES:TELLINGLAWS 459
New developments have thus complicated this profile. These
include intertextual studies positioning the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata in relation
to both Indo-European and Indian texts; genre study, including the
history of ka(cid:1)vya or Sanskrit ‘‘poetry’’ composed according to
classical aesthetic norms; debate on the likely period of the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s composition in written form; and the completion of
the Pune Critical Edition, along with wider recognition of the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s design. For a signal result of theMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s Pune
Critical Edition is its establishment of a textual ‘‘archetype.’’ There
remainsdebateastowhetherthisarchetypetakesusbacktothetext’s
firstcomposition,ortoalaterredactionthatwouldputafinalstamp
on centuries of cumulative growth. This essay favors the first option.
In either case, this archetype includes a design of eighteen Books or
parvans,15 nearly all the epic’s one hundred ‘‘little books’’ or
upaparvans (the list of these at 1.2.30–70 problematically includes as
numbers 99 and 100 parts of the Harivam: s(cid:2)a as the last two), and its
often adroit adhya(cid:1)ya breaks. Similar developments apply to
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a studies.
15 Schlinghoff’s contrary claims (1969) about the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s ‘‘oldest extant
parvan-list’’ based on the Ku:s(cid:1)an:a period ‘‘Spitzer manuscript’’ found in east
Turkestan have been revived by Franco (2004), with some additional information
andsuggestions:thatitmayhavecomefrom‘‘theGreatGandharaarea’’andbeen
written using a broad-nibbed copper pen (vol. 1, 11); that it is probably a Sarv(cid:1)a-
stiv(cid:1)adin text (19) from ‘‘around the second half of the third century’’ (33); that it
includedarefutationofGodinonefragment(18–19);andthatitsreferencetosome
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata units and brief encapsulation of the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a ‘‘may have been oc-
casionedbyadiscussionoftheBuddha’somniscience’’(17).Ifthelasttwothingsare
true,ithardlyseemsthattheBuddha’somnisciencewasdirectedtowardthe‘‘extant’’
totality of either epic. Indeed, not knowing the context, we cannot know what the
unitswerelistedfor,whybothparvansandsubparvanswereselected,whyinsome
cases theyare apparently listed outof sequenceand in otherswith one inclusive of
another, why the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata is digested by (selected) components and the

mentioningthesefeatureswereallonthesamepage.NoMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)ratascholarusing
the find as evidence of a once-shorter text (see Brockington, 1998, 131–132;
Fitzgerald in press, 1, 24 and nn. 17 and 19) has tried to explain what kind of
‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata’’ it would have been with the odd assortment of units mentioned. With
such uncertainties, notions that the Vira(cid:1)t:a- and Anus(cid:2)a(cid:1)sana-Parvans would not yet

Schlinghoff (338) proposes a(cid:1)(ran:eyam:) ‘‘or perhaps a(cid:1)(jagara)’’ – both subparvans

Vira(cid:1)t:aparvan (see Hiltebeitel, 1980b, 148 n. 4), or a(bhimanyu-viva(cid:1)ha), the main
adhya(cid:1)yaname (4.66–67)in Book4’sconcluding subparvan.

Traditional Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a scholarship has been marked by what
RobertGoldmancallsa‘‘zeal’’(1984,63)todemonstratethatmostor
allofthisepic’sfirstbookislate.Books2–6aretakentosupplymostor
allofthepoem’s‘‘‘genuine’portions,’’andtheclosingBook7istaken
asaxiomaticallylate.Forsuchscholars,Books2–6havepresentedthe
possibility of making a case that they narrate a largely consecutive
heroicstoryofamanwhoisforthemostpartnotyet‘‘divinized.’’
This view has also been challenged over the last several decades.
Pivotalto thisrethinkinghas beenthe completionof theRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s
Baroda Critical Edition (1960–1975). Most of the key passages that
speakofR(cid:1)amaasanincarnationofVi:sn:umaketheCriticalEdition’s
cut. The lateness of R(cid:1)ama’s ‘‘divinization’’ has thus been challenged
by Sheldon Pollock (1984) and supported by Goldman and Sally
Sutherland Goldman (1996). Pollock’s argument is that R(cid:1)ama’s
seeming humanity is a structural piece of the story threaded into the
poem along with a boon obtained by R(cid:1)avan:a from Brahm(cid:1)a: that of
invulnerabilityto deathfromalldifferentclasses ofbeingsotherthan
humans, whom he omitted because he disdained them. R(cid:1)ama must
thus be born as a man to slay R(cid:1)avan:a; more than this, he must think
heisamanuntilheaccomplishesthisgoal.ThefactthatR(cid:1)amakeeps
fairly well to this sense of himself until he has killed R(cid:1)avan:a would
then be a feature of the narrative rather than a way of disqualifying
theboonpassage,whichoccursinBook7,andthepassageinBook6
where,afterkillingR(cid:1)avan:a,R(cid:1)ama’sdivinityisfinallyrevealedtohim
by Brahm(cid:1)a.
Pollock (1986, 38–42) and Biardeau (1997a, 77–119) have also
introduced a consideration based on comparison with the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata and the fruits of its Pune Critical Edition. Up to
Book 2, each epic follows a similar archetypal design, with (in partly
my terms) each Book 1 introducing Frames, Origins, and the Youths
of the Heroes, and each Book 2 describing a pivotal Court Intrigue.
This approach can be carried further: Book 3: Forest (in the title of
both epics’ third books); Book 4: Inversions (the P(cid:1)an:d:avas’ topsy
turvy disguises in Vir(cid:1)at:a’s kingdom of Matsya, ‘‘Fish’’; R(cid:1)ama’s
engagementwiththetopsyturvyworldofmonkeys,inwhosecapital,
Ki:skindh(cid:1)a,theleadmonkeysplayoutareverseimageofR(cid:1)ama’sown

Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata term) made in Preparation for War (by both sides in
the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata; by Hanum(cid:1)an and all the monkeys in the
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a) with K:r:sn:a and Hanum(cid:1)an going as Divine Messengers
into the Enemy Camp where there are Attempts to Capture Them;
NOTWITHOUTSUBTALES:TELLINGLAWS 461
War Books (Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a 6; Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata 6–11), and Denouments
(Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a 7; Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata 12–18). As we shall see, this is only bare
bones that can be further fleshed out. The Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s term for its
Books is ka(cid:1)n:d:a, meaning a ‘‘section’’ of a stalk of a plant, such as
bamboo, between its joints; the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s is parvan, which can
mean the joints themselves of such a plant. Together they could
describe a complete stalk of a noded plant. Such closeness of design
cannot be accidental. In favoring the priority of the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata,
this article holds that Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a Books 1 and 7 are integral to its
earliest design and that the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a poet is not only familiar with
the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s design but intent upon refining it.
Such a relation can be exemplified by the two epics’ frame stories,
whichareopenedatthebeginningofthefirstBooksandleftpending
into the denouments.In both epics the frames are three-tiered. Inthe
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, there are in fact three frames. Initially, Vy(cid:1)asa recites
theepictohisfiveBrahmandisciples,firsttohissonS´ukaandthento
the other four, including Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana (1.1.63). Second, Vai-
s´amp(cid:1)ayana recites it at Vy(cid:1)asa’s bidding to King Janamejaya, a
descendantof theP(cid:1)an:d:avas,at hissnake sacrificesothathecan hear
the story of his ancestors. And third, the Bard Ugras´ravas, who
overheard Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana’s narration, brings it to S´aunaka and the
R::sis of the Naimi:sa Forestand recites it there in 18 Books(2.3.71).16
Unlike the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s three frame stories, which present a serial
layering of the first threerecitalsof supposedly thesame textthatare
scattered over its first 56 chapters and resumed in late portions of its
12thBook,theRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:aframe,inonlyitsfirstfourchaptersknown
as the upodgha(cid:1)ta or preamble, presents two progressive unfoldings of
the story – the first by the sage N(cid:1)arada to the hermit V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki; the
second by V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki himself, now a poet – that trace its ripening into
the third full unfolding, the Va(cid:1)lm(cid:1)iki Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a itself.
In the first, in answer to V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki’s opening question whether there
is an ideal man in the world today (1.1.2–5), N(cid:1)arada satisfies the
question with a brief and entirely laudatory account of R(cid:1)ama’s vir-
tues and adult life, presumably to date (1.1.7–76). Saying the mini-
mum about R(cid:1)ama’s killing of the monkey V(cid:1)alin (1.1.49, 55), N(cid:1)arada
hardly hints at anything problematic in R(cid:1)ama’s life and omits both
S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s fire ordeal and her banishment. Among the great R::sis or seers

R(cid:1)ama encounters, he mentions only Vasi:st:ha (29) and Agastya
(33–34).
In the second sarga, once N(cid:1)arada has left, V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki witnesses the
cries of grief of a female Kraun˜ca bird (probably the large monog-
amoussaruscrane(seeLeslie,1998)overtheslayingofhermatebya
‘‘cruel hunter,’’ and is provoked into the spontaneous utterance that
creates ‘‘verse’’ (and thus poetry) out of ‘‘grief’’ (s(cid:2)loka out of s(cid:2)oka;
1.2.9–15). As this verse is said to mark the origins of poetry, the
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a is called the a(cid:1)dika(cid:1)vya or ‘‘first poem’’ – a term that does
not occur in the Baroda Critical Edition, though it probably should
since it occurs in a universally attested sarga where, after S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a has
vanished into the earth, the god Brahm(cid:1)a encourages R(cid:1)ama to hear
the rest of this a(cid:1)dika(cid:1)vya (7, Appendix I, No. 13, lines 31–39). Now,

see what he did not know and what is still yet to happen – with,
moreover, the confirmation that his poem will endure so long as the
rivers and mountains last on earth and that it will all be true (1.2.33–
35). Brahm(cid:1)a thus assures V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki that he will know things omitted
from N(cid:1)arada’s encomium. Upon Brahm(cid:1)a’s vanishing, V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki now
conceives the idea of composing ‘‘the entire Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a poem (ka(cid:1)vya)
in verses such as these’’ (1.2.40cd) – that is, such as the (cid:2)sloka he has
just uttered.
In the third sarga, V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki meditatively enters into this project for
thefirst time(1.3.2) andhasasort ofpreviewof thestory(3–28):not
a retrospective table of contents like the Parvasam: graha (PS) – the
lengthy ‘‘Summaries of the Books’’ that forms the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s
second adhya(cid:1)ya and second upaparvan – but a kind of first glimpse
and unfolding of what his poem will contain. Here he provides the
first reference to some of R(cid:1)ama’s encounters with important R::sis (he
will hear Vis´v(cid:1)amitra’s stories [4], face R(cid:1)ama J(cid:1)amadagnya [5], and
hear Bharadv(cid:1)aja’s instructions [8]). Most important, while adding
nothing problematic on the slaying of V(cid:1)alin (15–16) and without
having mentioned S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s fire ordeal, he closes with S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s banishment
(28).
Then, looking back upon the poem’s completion, the fourth sarga
hints at the context in which V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki’s Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a will finally be told
bythetwinsKus´aandLavatotheirfatherR(cid:1)ama.Justasinformation
on the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s frame is resumed with further revelations
about Vy(cid:1)asa, S´uka and his co-disciples, and the Naimi:sa Forest is in
NOTWITHOUTSUBTALES:TELLINGLAWS 463
Book 12,17 the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s frame will be picked up in Book 7 when
Kus´a and Lava do just that: pick up the frame in the Naimi:sa Forest
(Ra(cid:1)m 7.82.14b)!18 The main difference is that when the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a
frame is reentered in Book 7, it is not just a matter of further reve-
lations about the composition that are difficult to relate to the main
story. V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki’s dramatic entry into the main story presents the
occasion to reveal the poetic heart of the whole poem through its
effectsonitsheroanditsheroine.Nonetheless,inbothepicsthereisa
moment where the author emerges from the frames to speak directly
to the epic’s main listener. In the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a this occurs at this cli-
mactic moment when V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki addresses R(cid:1)ama and confirms S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s
veracity before she enters the earth. In the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, in a much
less noticed but still quite dramatic passage, it occurs in the one time
that Vy(cid:1)asa addresses Janamejaya directly to tell the subtale
(upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na)oftheHorse’sHeadinanswertoaculminatingquestion
of the Na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:(cid:1)iya (see Hiltebeitel, in press-b).
V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki thus gets a triple inspiration – from N(cid:1)arada, the kraun˜c(cid:1)i,
and Brahm(cid:1)a. Yet the upodgha(cid:1)ta leaves us in suspenseas to when S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a
cametohisashram.WasitbeforeoraftertheKraun˜ cabirdincident?
The poem never tells whether V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki’s response to the female bird
comes before or after his familiarity with S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s grief at her banish-
ment. But in either case, now that V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki knows the whole story
from Brahm(cid:1)a, he could connectS(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’sbanishment with the cry of the
kraun˜c(cid:1)i whenever she arrived. What we do know is that, having had
pity (karun:a(cid:1); 1.2.11d) for the female bird, V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki will compose his
poem with pity as its predominant aesthetic flavor (an_g(cid:1)irasa) in
relation to grief (s(cid:2)oka) as its underlying stha(cid:1)yibha(cid:1)va or ‘‘stable aes-
thetic emotion.’’ The Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata provides no such developmental
inspiration story for its author Vy(cid:1)asa, although I believe the father-
son story of Vy(cid:1)asa and S´ uka is its analogue.19 Even though
Ugras´ravas seems to tell the Pauloma and A(cid:1)st(cid:1)ika subparvans on his
own, there is no suggestion that they are anything but the ‘‘entire
thought’’ofVy(cid:1)asa,andthereisnohintatanygrowthprocess–either

The Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a frame is thus shorter, more developmental, more
focused, and more poetically traceable into the main narrative and
the whole poem.

WHOLES, PARTS, AND TERMS OF IDENTIFICATION
In these passages, we see two of the three leading terms by which the
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a describes itself: ka(cid:1)vya (poem) and carita (adventure), the
third being a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (tale, narrative). Let us look at how these and
other terms are used by each epic to identify itself and to define the
relationship of its whole to its parts.
20 See Hiltebeitel (2001a, 99–105). Ugras´ravas recital in eighteen parvans (see
above at n. 16) would not add anything but rather be his way of arranging the
‘‘whole’’ tomeet thesacrificial timetableoftheNaimi:sa ForestR::sis’12-yearsattra
(1.1.1-2).
NOTWITHOUTSUBTALES:TELLINGLAWS 465
Most frequently, the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata characterizes itself fourteen
times as a ‘‘narrative’’ (a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na: 1.1.16a; 1.2.29b, 235c, 238a, 239b,
240b, and 241b; 1.53.31d and 32a; 1.56.1c, 30c, 32c; 12.337.10a,
18.45.53a) and eight times as a ‘‘history’’ (itiha(cid:1)sa: 1.1.17a, 24d, 52c;
1.2.237a,1.51.16c,1.56.18cand19a,1.93.46c).Butitalsocallsitselfa
work of ‘‘ancient lore’’ (pura(cid:1)n:a: 1.1.15b, 1.56.15d), a ‘‘story’’ (katha(cid:1):
1.56.2a), a ‘‘collection’’ (sam: hita(cid:1): 1.1.19.1c and 61b), a ‘‘fifth Veda’’
(1.57.74ab, 12.327.18ab), the ‘‘Veda that pertains to K:r:sn:a’’ (Ka(cid:1)r:sn:a
Veda, probably referring primarily to K:r:sn:a Dvaip(cid:1)ayana Vy(cid:1)asa –
1.1.205a, 1.56.17c), a ‘‘great knowledge’’ (mahaj-jn˜a(cid:1)na: 1.1.25b and
49a), a ‘‘treatise’’ (s(cid:2)a(cid:1)stra: 1.56.21: indeed, in this verse, a dhar-
mas(cid:2)a(cid:1)stra, arthas(cid:2)a(cid:1)stra, and mok:sas(cid:2)a(cid:1)stra; and probably 12.238.13c),21
an upani:sad (1.1.191a), a ‘‘biography’’ or ‘‘adventure’’ (carita:
1.56.1d),22 a‘‘victory’’(jaya:1.56.19a),and,surprisingly,a ‘‘subtale’’
(upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na: 1.2.236a)! In addition, while not calling itself one as a
whole,theepicisalsoadefacto‘‘dialogue’’(sam: va(cid:1)da),foritsustains
the dialogical interlacing of each of its three dialogical frame levels,
not to mention the multiple dialogues that the frame narrators and
other narrators report – like the Bhagavad G(cid:1)ita(cid:1), which Sam: jaya can
report to Dh:rtar(cid:1)a:st:ra ‘‘by the grace of Vy(cid:1)asa’’ (BhG 18.73 and 75 =
Mbh 6.40.73 and 75) thanks to Vy(cid:1)asa’s having given him the divine
eye (6.2.9–13; see Hiltebeitel 2001a, 56–59).
Indeed, most of these terms are used doubly. The more ‘‘didactic’’
(veda, sam: hita(cid:1), upani:sad, and s(cid:2)a(cid:1)stra) not only describe the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rataasawhole,but,farmoreoften,refertosourcesoutside
of it that the epic’s narrators cite as authoritative and sometimes
quote in part or digest – particularly the many s(cid:2)a(cid:1)stras or ‘‘treatises’’
mentioned by Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma in Book 12. But the more ‘‘narrative’’ terms
(sam: va(cid:1)da,a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na,itiha(cid:1)sa,pura(cid:1)n:a,carita,katha(cid:1),andupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na)can
also be cited as authoritative tales. In this way the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata
sustains itself as a multigenre work both in terms of its multiple self-
designations for the whole and in the interreferentiality between the
whole and its parts. This contrasts with the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a, whose poet
V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki composeshis workunder the single-genre title ofka(cid:1)vya.The
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata is not called a ka(cid:1)vya until a famous interpolation,

22Althoughthereisconstantoverlapintheuseofthemainnarrativeterms,there
is also sometimes a helpful distinction, such as at 13.107.141 where four narrative
genresarementionedaseachtobealwaysheard:pura(cid:1)n:a,itiha(cid:1)sa,whatevera(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas

Vy(cid:1)asa to pronounce on the genre question: Says Vy(cid:1)asa, ‘‘O Blessed
one, I have created this highly venerated ka(cid:1)vya (ka(cid:1)vyam: para-
mapu(cid:1)jitam) in which I have proclaimed the secret of the Vedas
(vedarahasyam) and other topics’’ (Vulgate 1.1.61–62; Pune Critical
Edition1,App.I,lines13–14),towhichBrahm(cid:1)areplies,‘‘Iknowthat
since your birth you have truthfully given voice to the brahman. You
have called this a ka(cid:1)vya, and therefore a ka(cid:1)vya it shall be. No poets
(kavayo) are equal to the excellence of this ka(cid:1)vya’’ (Vulgate 1.1.72–
73b; Critical Ed. 1, App. I, lines 33–35). In a second and later
interpolation that reads now as part of the same passage, Brahm(cid:1)a
then recommends that Gan:es´a be Vy(cid:1)asa’s scribe (Vulgate 1.1.74–83;
Critical Ed. 1, App. I, apud line 36).
One striking thing about the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s ‘‘narrative’’ terms for
itself anditsparts,includingcarita23andeventuallyka(cid:1)vya24–thatis,
the terms themselves, even though the genres they describe all de-
velop, change, and overlap by classical times– is that theyare all but
one Vedic. Indeed, the Vedic resonances of three of them – a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na,
itiha(cid:1)sa,andsam: va(cid:1)da25–aresostrongthattheywereonceattheheart
of long debates centered on an ‘‘a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na theory’’ of the origins of
Vedic poetry itself (see Patton, 1996, 195–214). The one non-Vedic
exception seems to be upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na – a term that may have been given
itsfirstlifebytheauthorsoftheMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata.26Theypresentatopic

26 That is, as far as I can ascertain it is a non-Vedic term: see Monier-Williams
([1899] 1964, 212), citing nothing earlier than the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata. Barbara Gombach
introduces some uncertainty here. While positing throughout her dissertation that

whose significance – for both epics – has not been sufficiently

As observed, the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas are precisely the units mentioned as
omitted in the ‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata.’’ But what are the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas and, first of
all, how many are there? Although one could arrive at shorter lists, I

Itisnotevidenthowcertainsubtalescametobecalledupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas
and others by other genre terms. But there does not seem to be any-
thing to discourage the view that traditional unit titles would have
beenpartofthetext’searliestself-conception,sinceboththeNorthern
and Southern Recensions provide intelligible patterns, in what one
could call a colophon discourse, of giving common, similar, and
sometimes alternate upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na and other names for adhya(cid:1)yas and
largernarrativeunits.ThisisnotthecaseintheRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a,forwhichI
consider the number of upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas to be zero. The Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a men-
tions no upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in passing or in the upodgha(cid:1)ta, which would be
the closest analogue to the PS; and the practice of giving names to
sargasandlargerunitsdiffersfromthatforadhya(cid:1)yasandlargerunits
in the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata in one important respect. The Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s Ba-
rodaCriticalEditionshowsthatwhileNorthernRecensioncolophons
do name a few units primarily as upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas,31 the Southern
Recension gives none as either primary or secondary names. In fact,
theSouthernRecensiongiveshardlyanysargaorlargerunitnamesat
all.32 The extensive absence of Southern Recension sarga names,
especially the total absence with regard to the few units called
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in the Northern Recension, confirms that there would be
no upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a insofar as they could be counted as
suchintheBarodaCriticalEdition,whichwouldrequiresomeparity
across recensions. I take this as evidence that the few instances of
naming units upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in Northern Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a manuscripts is late
and probably affected by the usage in the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata. Indeed, it
would appear that whereas the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s names for adhya(cid:1)yas
31 These are the R:s(cid:2)ya(cid:2)s:rn_ga-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (1.8–10), Vedavat(cid:1)i-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (7.17),

(7.69), and Id:a(cid:1)/Ila(cid:1)-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (7.78–79). R:s´yas´:rn_ga and Mandh(cid:1)at:r also give their
names to Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas. Seven units are also given upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na as a
secondary title: Surabh(cid:1)i-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (2.68), Sugr(cid:1)iva-Vaira-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (4.10),

and larger units tend to be genre-related, the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s names for

A(cid:1)khya(cid:1)naandupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)naarethusbothamongthemultigenreterms
by which the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata characterizes itself and its varied compo-
nents. If a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na – even ahead of itiha(cid:1)sa – is the term used most
frequently to describe the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata as a whole, and upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na,
perhapsbizarrely,oneoftheleasttodoso(theMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)ratawouldbe
a subtale to what? the Veda?), a first order of business would be to
distinguish uses of a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na from upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na. Clearly, there would be
ananalogybetweentheusagesofa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na:upa-a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)naandparvan:

the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata down by terms that relate its whole to its parts: the
totality of its parts in the case of the upaparvans; some of its parts in
the case of the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas. A(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na and upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na are frequently
used interchangeably (as indeed with the other ‘‘narrative’’ terms
mentionedabove).Sometimes,especiallyinthePS,itwouldseemthat
metrical fit is all that has decided which of the two terms was used.33
But the first usage of a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na to self-describe a sub-narrative in

bha(cid:1)rata-A(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, it brims with substories of its own.34 It is delivered
by the bard Ugras´ravas to the Sages (R::sis) of the Naimi:sa Forest as
the main introductory piece to entertain that audience in the epic’s

As to upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na narrators, Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana addresses ten to
Janamejaya (1–4, 11, 32, 39–40, 66–67); Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma narrates twenty-
three: 21 (44–52, 54–65) to Yudhi:st:hira and the P(cid:1)an:d:avas and two
(35–36) to Duryodhana; Lomas´a R::si tells eight of nine (from num-
bers 14–22) to the P(cid:1)an:d:avas, M(cid:1)arkan:d:eya R::si also tells them eight
(23–28 and 30–31), and K:r:sn:a four (12, 41–42); Citraratha narrates
three (6–8) to Arjuna and the P(cid:1)an:d:avas; S´alya tells two: 1 (33) to
Yudhi:st:hira, the other (38) to Karn:a and Duryodhana; Vy(cid:1)asa tells
one to Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3)’s father Drupada (9) and another to the P(cid:1)an:d:avas
(29); and six are told by single-time speakers: Kunt(cid:1)(cid:3) to P(cid:1)an:d:u (5, the
only upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na spoken by a woman), N(cid:1)arada to the P(cid:1)an:d:avas (10);
B:rhadas´va to the P(cid:1)an:d:avas (13); Ak:rtavran:a to the P(cid:1)an:d:avas (15,
interrupting Lomas´a’s skein); R(cid:1)ama J(cid:1)amadagnya to the Kauravas
(34);andDuryodhanatoKarn:aandS´ alya(47).Astoauditors,ofthe
56 that are addressed to main characters, 49 are told primarily to
Yudhi:st:hira, 48 of these to him and his P(cid:1)an:d:ava brothers, and 44 of
these also to their wife Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3) (all of these told once the P(cid:1)an:d:avas
and Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3) are in the forest). On the Kaurava side, three are
addressed to Duryodhana and two to Karn:a. Adding the 10 told to
JanamejayaandonenarratedtoP(cid:1)an:d:ubyKunt(cid:1)(cid:3),onefindsthat65of
the 67 upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas are addressed directly to members of the larger
Kaurava household to which all these listeners belong, and of which
Yudhi:st:hira is clearly the chief listener. Not irrelevant to this pattern
is the one in which King Drupada hears upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na 9 as an expla-
nation of how his daughter can marry into that household. And
likewise not irrelevant would be the last upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na in this tally, the
anomalous number 53 known in S colophons (see n. 30) as the
Na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:(cid:1)iye Haya(cid:2)sira-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na. Here the primary narrator is
Ugras´ravas, who answers a question by S´aunaka (speaking for the
Naimi:sa Forest R::sis) about the Horse’s Head, a form of Vi:sn:u, by
quoting what Vy(cid:1)asa told Janamejaya about that subject.36 With
Janamejaya as one of the two listeners, one can now say that all the
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas are addressed in one way or another to those with ties to
the Kaurava household. Moreover, with Vy(cid:1)asa, author of the
36 The Critical Edition has suppressed this anomalous feature, overriding the
preponderant manuscript evidence at 12.335.1 and 9 to have Janamejaya cite
Yudhi:st:hira as the oneaddressed byVy(cid:1)asa. SeeHiltebeitel (press-b).

outermost frame, addressingJanamejaya for once in the inner frame,
where he otherwise sits silently and leaves the recitation to
Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana,andtohaveallthisfurtherreportedbyUgras´ravasto
the Naimi:sa Forest R::sis, means that this upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na cuts across the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s three frames.37 Further, that the Naimi:sa Forest R::sis
are, this one and only time, an interested party to a subtale suggests
their proximity to this mysterious Veda-reciting form of Vi:sn:u that
resides in the ‘‘great northern’’ or milky ocean, which seems to be
somewhere, like the Naimi:sa (‘‘Twinkling’’) Forest itself, in the
heavenly night sky.38
Anotherapproachtotheupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nasistothinkaboutvolumeand
proportion. Taking the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s own numbers, on the face of
it,iftheepichas100,000coupletsandVy(cid:1)asacomposedaversionofit
in24,000couplets‘‘withouttheupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas’’(1.1.61),theupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas
should constitute 76% of the whole. That proportion is not to be
found. Calculating from the roughly 73,900 couplets in the Critical
Edition,39 the full total for the 67 upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas is 10,521 couplets or
13.87%; and if one adds certain sequels40 to four of the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas
totaling780versestoreachthemostgenerouscountof11,031verses,
onecouldsaythat,atmost,14.93%oftheMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rataiscomposed
of upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na material. While we are nowhere near 76%, these pro-
portions are not insignificant. Moreover, one can get a bit closer to
76% if one keeps in mind the interchangeability of the epic’s terms
for narrative units and calculates from the totality of its substory
material. According to Barbara Gombach, ‘‘nearly fifty percent’’ of
the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata is ‘‘represented by ancillary stories,’’ with Books 1,
3, 12, and 13 cited as the four in which ‘‘the stories cluster more
densely’’ than in the other Books (2000, I, 5 and 24). Gombach (I,
194;225)gives68%fortheancillarystoriesintheS(cid:2)a(cid:1)ntiparvan(Book

A count has to be approximate because the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata contains prose passages.
Onealso hasto countall coupletsas ‘‘(cid:2)slokas.’’

contain more than one upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, the A(cid:1)svamedhika- (Book 14) with
two, S(cid:2)alya- (Book 9) with two, and Udyogaparvan (Book 5) with

Fifty-seven of the sixty-seven upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas thus occur in parvans 1,
3, 12, and 13 where ‘‘stories cluster’’ most densely. There are, how-
ever, two major differences in the ways upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas are presented in
the two early Booksfrom the two laterones. Whereas Books 1 and 3

two upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas earlier, one each in Books 5 and 6 [numbers 35 and
36], to Duryodhana). And whereas Books 1 and especially 3 show a
tendency to cluster their upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas (two in a row are told by Vai-
s´amp(cid:1)ayana and three in a row by the Gandharva Chitraratha in
Book 1; nine, five, and two in a row by R::sis whom the P(cid:1)an:d:avas
encounter while pilgrimaging in Book 3), in Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma’s run of four
hundred and fifty adhya(cid:1)yas in Books 12 and 13, he tends to present
his twenty-one upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas there only intermittently. Yet there is one
run, from the end of Book 12 through the first third of Book 13,
where he concentrates nine of them. These two books run together
the totality of Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma’s postwar instructions to Yudhi:st:hira in four
consecutive upaparvans, which James Fitzgerald calls ‘‘four large
anthologies’’ (2004 a,b, 79–80). Both Books abound in dialogues
(sam: va(cid:1)das), ‘‘ancient accounts’’ (itiha(cid:1)sam pura(cid:1)tanam),42 and other
genres. Why then does Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma intensify his upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas at this
juncture? This question will be taken up in Section C.

strata. Regarding the most famous of all the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas, the Nala-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, Fitzgerald regards ‘‘Nala’’ and
someothernon-upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nastoriesas‘‘goodexamplesofpassagesthat
do exhibit an inventive freedom suggestive of ‘fiction.’’’53 More
pointedly, Gombach credits Madeleine Biardeau’s study of ‘‘Nala’’
(1984, 1985) as a ‘‘case for regarding this upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na as a story com-
posedinandfortheepictodeepenitssymbolicresonances’’(2000,I,

epicitself,’’Gombachsettlesforamiddleposition:thatsomeancillary
storiesareinterpolateddoesnotmeanthatallareinterpolated(2000,
I, 164–165). But this renders the notion of interpolation and the
distinction between authors on the one hand and redactors, editors,
and compilers on the other as rather whimsical.54 ‘‘Nala’’ is what
Biardeau now calls one of Book 3’s three ‘‘mirror stories’’ (2002, I,
412–413) – tales that mirror the listeners’ (the P(cid:1)an:d:avas and Drau-
pad(cid:1)(cid:3)’s)currenttrials.Weshallnotesomeotherupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nasthatmerit

cannot be easily shut off, as we shall observe.
AstotheRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a,wenoticedatthebeginningofthissectionthat
the three terms ka(cid:1)vya, carita, and a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na are woven through the

7.1.2 links with N(cid:1)arada as a fifth Veda.57 Similarly, upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na,
‘‘subtale,’’ is used only in the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, although there is an
interpolated verse in the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s As´vamedha recital scene where
the twins begin singing the poem and tell R(cid:1)ama that the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a
has24thousandversesandahundredupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas(7.1328*,following

A distinctive point about the usage of ka(cid:1)vya is that it is used only
at theRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s twoframing points:58 nine timesin theupodgha(cid:1)ta,
four in the two chapters of the As´vamedha recital scene (7.84–85)
where the hints left at the end of the upodgha(cid:1)ta are picked up as the

frame).Itthushasakindofbookendfunctionofdescribingthework
as poetry, most notably that ‘‘it is replete with’’ all the ‘‘poetic sen-
timents’’ or rasas (1.4.8).59 In contrast to ka(cid:1)vya, carita implies the
p
‘‘movement’’ ( fficar) of the main narrative. Of its four usages in the
upodgha(cid:1)tatocharacterizetheRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a,twopresentajuxtaposition.
The first has Brahm(cid:1)a enjoin V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki to ‘‘compose the whole adven-
ture of R(cid:1)ama (ra(cid:1)masya caritam: k:rtsnam: kuru)’’ (1.2.30cd). The sec-
ond,onceitisimpliedthatV(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)kihascomposedit,calls‘‘thewhole
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a poem (ka(cid:1)vya) the great adventure of S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a (s(cid:1)ita(cid:1)ya(cid:1)s caritam
mahat)’’ (1.4.6). This suggests that although R(cid:1)ama’s adventure is
V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki’s starting point the complete poem is also about S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s
56Though,curiously,theonlyinstancewherepura(cid:1)n:adescribesastoryofanykind

toldhimthat,‘‘inanancientlegend(pura(cid:1)n:e)’’heonceheard(4.61.3),R(cid:1)ama’slifewas
foretold withsome strange andexceptional twists(4–13).
57 Clearly the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata does not do this. I would even suggest that V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki
might be registering a distrust of this tradition, which the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a puts under
questionrightatthebeginningwhenN(cid:1)aradadescribesR(cid:1)amaastheidealman.Note
that in the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, N(cid:1)arada includes R(cid:1)ama among the sixteen great kings of

being upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nanumber 41,as quoted byK:r:sn:a.
58 Aside from ka(cid:1)vya, the only other words to describe the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a at the
As´vamedharecitalarecaritaand,asthetwinsnowsingit,g(cid:1)ita(cid:1):‘‘Havingheardthe

adventure.The‘‘profoundadventure’’thatR(cid:1)amaprepareshimselfto
hear at the end of the upodgha(cid:1)ta would thus include the two adven-
tures intertwined (4.26). This sense of carita as ongoing double
adventure carries through the narrative. For instance, when
Hanum(cid:1)an begins to tell Bharata about ‘‘R(cid:1)ama’s whole adventure in
theforest(sarvam: ra(cid:1)masyacaritam: vane)’’(6.114.4cd)neartheendof
Book 6, he tells mainly of the separate adventures of R(cid:1)ama and S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a
once the latter is abducted (cf. 2.54.18). Carita is also the main word
to describe the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s adventures in course (2.54.18; 6.114.4) –
andeveninthecourseofhearingit.Whenthetwinsbeginrecitingthe
poem and R(cid:1)ama asks who composed it, they reply, ‘‘The blessed
V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki, who has reached the presence of the sacrifice, is the author
(karta(cid:1))bywhomthisadventureisdisclosedtoyouwithoutremainder
(yena idam: caritam: tubhyam as(cid:2)e:sam: sampradar(cid:2)sitam)’’ (7.85.19).
Meanwhile, a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na is used four times in the upodgha(cid:1)ta. It
describes the benefits of hearing the tale’s recital (1.1.78), that it is
‘‘unsurpassed’’ as a ‘‘tale exemplary of righteousness (dharmyam
a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nam uttamam)’’ (1.4.11), that it is a ‘‘wondrous tale told by the
sage’’thathe‘‘completedinperfectsequence’’as‘‘thegreatsourceof
inspiration for poets (kav(cid:1)ina(cid:1)m)’’ (1.4.20), and that R(cid:1)ama urged his
brothers to ‘‘listen to this tale whose words and meanings alike are
wonderful as it is sweetly sung by these two godlike men’’ (1.4.25). It
is also the first term to describe the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a as the recital of its
mainstorybegins:‘‘Ofthesekingsofillustriouslineage,theIk:sv(cid:1)akus,
this great tale is known as the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a. I will recite it from the
beginning in its entirety, omitting nothing. It is in keeping with the
goals of righteousness, profit, and pleasure and should be listened to
with faith’’ (1.5.3–4). A(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na can also be used for tales told in
course, most notably for the ‘‘glad tidings’’ that Hanum(cid:1)an brings at
various points to others (5.57.1, 59.6, 6.101.17, 113.40).60 It is thus
complementary to both ka(cid:1)vya and carita. It links the narrative to
poetry and the inspiration of poets while also bringing listeners into
the unfolding of the hero and heroine’s double adventure, the
reiterations of that adventure by Hanum(cid:1)an, and the blessings that it
brings when heard with faith.
The Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a thus makes very selective use of limited terms. In
contrast to the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, they are used strategically rather than
60 In contrast to these four consistent usages and the four in the upodgha(cid:1)ta, it is

UPA(cid:1)KHYA(cid:1)NAS IN THE MAHA(cid:1)BHA(cid:1)RATA
To summarize the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, we have now seen that it should no
longer be enough to tell its main story, especially with the suggestion
that its main story would have been an original ‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata’’ with the
rest making it a ‘‘Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata.’’ Even though it must require
shortcuts, one owes it to this grand text to attempt to block out the
main story against the backdrop of its archetypal design, which
includes its frame stories, upaparvans, upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas, and theenigma of
the author. For present purposes, touching only lightly on the
upaparvans but keeping the frames and the author in view, it must
suffice to focus on the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas – especially where they are woven
into their Books’ structures. Our attention will thus be given only to
Books 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, and 14.
Book 1, the A(cid:1)di Parvan, takes its first five upaparvans to introduce
the three frames around relatedmatter. Its sixth, on ‘‘The Descent of
the First Generations,’’ runs from the birth of Vy(cid:1)asa (son of the seer
Par(cid:1)as´ara and the ferryboat girl Satyavat(cid:1)(cid:3)) and the gods’ descent to
rescue the goddess Earth to an account of the origins of gods,
demons, and other beings. From there, upaparvan seven pauses over
the epic’s first two upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas, the S(cid:2)akuntala(cid:1)- and Yaya(cid:1)ti-Up-
khya(cid:1)nas, about Lunar Dynasty ancestors (S´akuntal(cid:1)a was the mother
of Bharata, one of the line’s eponyms), to introduce that dynasty’s
early genealogy down to the youths of the main heroes, with
heightened attention to the three generations before them. This
narrative widening begins with the Maha(cid:1)bhi:sa-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (number
3),61 about how Mah(cid:1)abhi:sa, a royal sage residing in heaven, boldly
gazes up the windblown skirt of the heavenly river Gan_g(cid:1)a and is
61 One of the epic’s ‘‘three beginnings’’ (see 1.1.50); these are probably recom-
mendedfor performance purposes like the 24,000verseBha(cid:1)rata.

who learns that he was impaled as the result of a childhood sin in his
previous life and curses the god Dharma – lord of post-mortem
punishmentsandthus‘‘functionally’’63tantamountinthis,hisvirtual
epic debut, to Yama, god of the dead – to suffer Vidura’s low-caste
human birth. From here, one enters upon the generation of the main
heroes. Dh:rtar(cid:1)a:st:ra’s marriage to G(cid:1)andh(cid:1)ar(cid:1)(cid:3) yields the hundred
Kauravas, incarnate demons headed by Duryodhana. And once
P(cid:1)an:d:u becomes impotent after his marriages to Kunt(cid:1)(cid:3) and M(cid:1)adr(cid:1)(cid:3),
Kunt(cid:1)(cid:3) tells him the Vyu:sita(cid:1):sva-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (number five) about a
queen made pregnant by her husband even after he was dead as part
of the build-up to her disclosure that she has the means to induce
pregnancy by gods, which results in P(cid:1)an:d:u choosing Dharma to sire
his first son, Yudhi:st:hira, and so on. Already we see how impover-
ished the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata would be ‘‘without upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas,’’ the first five
of which tie in with the main story through a train of curses and
boons having to do with sex with death, identify dharma/Dharma as
death/Yama, and, while stirring up such undercurrents below the

surface, lay the groundwork for the birth of Dharma’s son, Dhar-
mar(cid:1)aja Yudhi:st:hira.
After some youthful trials, the P(cid:1)an:d:avas must conceal their
survival from the Kauravas, which they do disguised as Brahmans,
and Vy(cid:1)asa appears to direct them to Pan˜c(cid:1)ala where they will meet
their destined bride. On the way Arjuna defeats the Gandharva
Citraratha who had challenged him. Citraratha tells the P(cid:1)an:d:avas
they are vulnerable without keeping a priest and holy fires, and
then relates three upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in succession: the Tapat(cid:1)i-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na
(about another of their ancestresses Tapat(cid:1)(cid:3), daughter of the Sun
and mother of the eponymous Kuru), and the Vasi:st:ha- and
Aurva-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas (about Brahmans), all three of which prepare
them for forthcoming adventures while imparting some positive
and negative information on marriage and sexuality.64 Then, when
the five P(cid:1)an:d:avas, still disguised as Brahmans, marry Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3),
Vy(cid:1)asa, who ‘‘by chance arrived’’ (1.187.32d), sanctions the
marriage by telling Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3)’s father Drupada the Pan˜cendra-
Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na: At a sacrifice performed by the gods at Naimi:sa
Forest, Yama was consecrated as the (cid:2)samit:r priest assigned to
putting victims to death, which detained him from killing humans
for the rite’s duration, making the gods edgy until they learned
from Brahm(cid:1)a that the rite would strengthen Yama for this job
once it was done. As one of the attendees, Indra then saw golden
lotuses floating down the Gan_g(cid:1)a and traced them upriver to the
tears of the goddess S´r(cid:1)(cid:3), who was weeping at the river’s source
over the fall of four former Indras, her former husbands, into a
cave as the result of their arrogance toward S´ iva. Once the current
Indra has suffered the same fate, Vy(cid:1)asa reveals that the P(cid:1)an:d:avas
are the five Indras, cursed by S´iva to become mortals and marry
Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3), who is S´ r(cid:1)(cid:3) incarnate, which gives the marriage a
resemblance of monogamy; they will regain Indroloka only after
performing ‘‘unbearable’’ (avi:sahya) and lethal karma. Further,
K:r:sn:a and Balar(cid:1)ama have joined them incarnated from two hairs
of Vi:sn:u. The Pan˜cendra-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na thus shifts the emphasis from
the five gods who sire the P(cid:1)an:d:avas, beginning with Dharma, to
the P(cid:1)an:d:avas being additionally five Indras. Vy(cid:1)asa says nothing
explicit to indicate that Yama’s death-dealing mission is to be

carried out in the person of Yudhi:st:hira at the battle of
Kuruk:setra. But if Dharma and Yama are ‘‘functionally’’ the
same, this conclusion would be inevitable (see Hiltebeitel, 2001a,
119–120). The ninth upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, spoken by the author himself, thus
deftly knots together threads we detected in the first five.65
After some amends are made between the two camps, the seer
N(cid:1)aradaarrivesattheP(cid:1)an:d:avas’newcapital,Indraprastha,totellthe
Sunda-Upasunda-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na about two demonic brothers who kill
each other over a woman, thereby warning the P(cid:1)an:d:avas to regulate
their time with Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3) and providing them with an inverse mirror
story to their own situation – and the very rule that will send Arjuna
into aperiodof exile in which hewillmarry threeotherwomen. Two
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in a row are thus concerned with the marriage of
Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3): through the first, Vy(cid:1)asa tells Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3)’s father Drupada
the divine secret that makes it legal, and through the second N(cid:1)arada
tells the P(cid:1)an:d:avas how to regulate it. Finally, when Arjuna and
K:r:sn:a burn the Kh(cid:1)an:d:ava Forest to satisfy Agni and clear the
ground for the construction of Indraprastha, Book 1 closes with the
S(cid:2)a(cid:1)rn_gaka-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na about some precocious birds reminiscent of
the four Vedas (Biardeau 1971–72, 140–141) who escape the blaze.
Book 3, the A(cid:1)ran:yakaparvan, relates 21 upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas during the
P(cid:1)an:d:avas’ residence in the forest. Early on, K:r:sn:a tells its first
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na – the Saubhavadha-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na – to explain his absence
from the dice match. Thereafter, most of the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas relate to
events in the Book’s second through fifth upaparvans and its final
three. The opening sequence tells of the P(cid:1)an:d:avas’ forest-entering
encounter with the monstrous R(cid:1)ak:sasa Kirm(cid:1)(cid:3)ra, killed by Bh(cid:1)(cid:3)ma;
Arjuna’s encounter with S´iva on Mount Kail(cid:1)asa to obtain divine
weapons; and Arjuna’s further adventures in the heaven of his father
Indra. In Arjuna’s absence, the other P(cid:1)an:d:avas and Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3) then
go on pilgrimage and hear numerous stories, many billed as
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas. Thus nine – the Agastya-, R:s(cid:2)yas(cid:2):rn_ga-, Ka(cid:1)rtav(cid:1)irya-,
Sukanya(cid:1)-, Ma(cid:1)ndha(cid:1)t:r-, Jantu-, S(cid:2)yena-Kapot(cid:1)iya-, A:st:a(cid:1)vakr(cid:1)iya-, and
Yavakr(cid:1)ita-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas – are told during the ‘‘Tour of the Sacred
Fords’’ to the pilgrimaging P(cid:1)an:d:avas minus Arjuna, with all but one
of these, Ka(cid:1)rtav(cid:1)irya, narrated by the group’s sage travelling com-
panion Lomas´a. And once Arjuna has rejoined them, the P(cid:1)an:d:avas

and Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3) hear six more upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas narrated by the ageless sage
M(cid:1)arkan:d:eya: the Vainya- (a story of King Vainya and the R::sis Atri
and Gautama), Matsya-, Man:d:u(cid:1)ka-, Indradyumna-, Dhundhuma(cid:1)ra-,
and Pativrata(cid:1)-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas. Then, after further forest adventures,
Vy(cid:1)asa comes ‘‘desirous of seeing’’ (3.245.8c) the P(cid:1)an:d:avas to tell
them the Mudgala-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, a tale illustrative of the superiority of
giving over asceticism and the first of several upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas to empha-
size the merits of un˜chav:rtti Brahmanswho practice the vow of living
only on gleaning (un˜cha) – that is, eating only grains left over from
theharvest–and,morethanthis,whowillinglygivetheirmeagerfare
to demanding hungry guests – in this case, the chronically famished
R::si Durv(cid:1)asas.66 Immediately after Vy(cid:1)asa’s visit, the closing three
upaparvans then tell of Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3)’s abduction by the Kauravas’
brother-in-law Jayadratha, following which M(cid:1)arkan:d:eya tells two
more upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas; Karn:a gift to Indra of his natural-born golden
armor and earrings; and, in closing, ‘‘‘The Fire-Sticks Subtale’ in
whichDharmainstructshisson(a(cid:1)ran:eyamupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)namyatradharmo
’nvaza(cid:1)t sutam)’’ (1.2.127cd).
As noted, three upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in Book 3 stand out as what Biardeau
calls ‘‘mirror stories’’: the Nala-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na – the love story about
Nala and Damayant(cid:1)(cid:3) told by the seer B:rhadas´va while Arjuna is
visiting S´iva and Indra and Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3) misses this favorite of her
husbands;theRa(cid:1)ma-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na–a‘‘Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata-sensitive’’version
of the R(cid:1)ama story (see Hiltebeitel, press-a) focused on S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s
abduction and told to all five P(cid:1)an:d:avas and Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3)
by M(cid:1)arkan:d:eya just after Draupad(cid:1)(cid:3)’s abduction; and the
Sa(cid:1)vitr(cid:1)i-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na – the story of a heroine who saved her husband
from Yama, told by M(cid:1)arkan:d:eya just after the Ra(cid:1)ma-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na
whenYudhi:st:hiraasks,havingalreadyheardaboutS(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a,ifthereever

maintenance to his adopted daughter Kunt(cid:1)(cid:3) (1.104; 1.113–114; 5.142.19). In the
Durva(cid:1)so-Ma(cid:1)ha(cid:1)tmya (13.144), Yudhi:st:hira directs a question about honoring Brah-

slighting of S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a is rather curious). Finally, the ‘‘Firesticks Subtale’’
then closes Book 3 as it began with the encounter of a monster who
appears first as a speaking crane and for the moment ‘‘kills’’ the four
youngest P(cid:1)an:d:avas at a lake where they have gone to slake their
thirst. But whereas the first monster, Kirm(cid:1)(cid:3)ra, was a R(cid:1)ak:sasa, this
crane turns into a one-eyed Yak:sa before he reveals himself, after
questioning Yudhi:st:hira, to be Yudhi:st:hira’s own father Dharma in
disguise. Gratified at his son’s subtle answers to his puzzling ques-
tions, Dharma revives Dharmar(cid:1)aja Yudhi:st:hira’s brothers and gives
him the boon of ‘‘the heart of the dice’’ – something that had saved
Nala in the Nala-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na and is now a cue to Yudhi:st:hira not

that a subcurrent runs between the Sa(cid:1)vitr(cid:1)i-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na in which
Yama restores life to S(cid:1)avitr(cid:1)(cid:3)’s husband Satyavan and the ‘‘Firesticks

Book 4, which will speak of the P(cid:1)an:d:avas’ year in concealment in
Matsya as a rebirth from the womb (4.66.10cd). We shall find later
support for reasoning that the PS calls the ‘‘Firesticks Subtale’’ an
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, even though it is the only one that is part of the main
story, just because so many upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na cross-currents run through it.

K:r:sn:a as divine messenger comes as the P(cid:1)an:d:avas’ last negotiator
with the Kauravas while a host of celestial seers descend to watch
the proceedings and tell stories: one of them an upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na about
the arrogant king Dambhodbhava that R(cid:1)ama J(cid:1)amadagnya tells to
warn Duryodhana that Arjuna and K:r:sn:a are the ancient indomi-

K:r:sn:a has to the first three P(cid:1)an:d:avas) with a last abusive message

disadvantage Duryodhana in the war.71
Book 8, the Karn:aparvan, is the only war book with upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas
woven into its structure. On the war’s seventeenth day, Karn:a
promises Duryodhana the death of Arjuna and Arjuna promises
Yudhi:st:hira – by now obsessed about Karn:a – to finish off Karn:a.
Regarding S´alya as the only match for K:r:sn:a’s charioteering, Karn:a
requests that S´ alya be his charioteer, and Duryodhana, to convince
S´ alya, recounts the Tripura-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na about how Brahm(cid:1)a came to
drive S´ iva’s chariot in S´ iva’s conquest of the Triple City of the
demons.72 S´alya then agrees on condition that he can say what he
pleases, and engages Karn:a in a duel of insults that includes the
Ham: sa-Ka(cid:1)k(cid:1)iya-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na in which he compares Karn:a’s challenge
to Arjuna to a crow challenging a gander. These subtales recall that
the events of this parvan could not occur without those that preface
the Indravijaya-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, in which S´alya promised Yudhi:st:hira
that when Karn:a asked him to be his charioteer, S´alya would
undermine Karn:a’s confidence.
Book 12, the S(cid:2)a(cid:1)ntiparvan, begins to tell how Yudhi:st:hira, beset by
grief over all the warriors slain so that he could rule, is persuaded by
his family, counsellors (including K:r:sn:a, N(cid:1)arada, and Vy(cid:1)asa), and
Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma to give up his guiltridden aspirations to renunciation and
accept his royal duties. In its early going, K:r:sn:a contributes the
Book’s first three upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas. At the capital, he recites two in a row:

the last upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na in each anthology. Thus Dharma himself appears

gaining heaven – which turns out to be eating only what is
gleaned after grains and other food have been harvested (Un˜chav:rtti-

reachedthejuncturementionedearlierwhereBh(cid:1)(cid:3):smaislaunchinghis
only concentrated stretch of upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas.
Book 13, the Anus(cid:2)a(cid:1)sanaparvan, begins with Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma’s fourth
anthology, on Da(cid:1)nadharma, comprising his closing ‘‘further instruc-
tions’’74 to Yudhi:st:hira on ‘‘the law of the gift’’ (upaparvan 87). Here
we must consider Fitzgerald’s hypothesis that the four anthologies
demonstrate decreasing ‘‘tautness’’ and increasing relaxation as the
result of ‘‘a progressive loosening of editorial integration’’ (2004,
147–48) over centuries, from the second century BCE down to the
fourth-to-fifth century CE (114). Fitzgerald’s point is buttressed by
thegeneralimpressionscholarshavehadthattheAnu(cid:2)sa(cid:1)sanaparvanis
loose and late. R. N. Dandekar, the Critical Edition editor of this
last-to-be-completed parvan, perhaps puts it best:
Thescopeandnatureofthecontentsofthisparvanweresuchthatliterallyanytopic
under the sun could be broached and discussed in it.… This has resulted in poor
Yudhi:st:hira being represented as putting to his grandsire some of the most ele-
mentary questions – often without rhyme or reason. Not infrequently, these ques-
tions serve as mere excuses for introducing a legend or a doctrine fancied by the
redactor,nomatterifithasalreadyoccurredinanearlierpartoftheEpic,notonce
butseveral times (1966,xlvii).
Even more pointedly Dandekar remarks, ‘‘Yudhi:st:hira’s questions
are mostly elementary in character and often show the questioner
to be just a simpleton.’’75 No doubt Dandekar had the
Bhan_ga(cid:1)s(cid:2)vana-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na principally in mind, in which Yudhi:st:hira,
seemingly quite out of the blue, asks, ‘‘In the act of coition, who
derives the greater pleasure – man or woman’’ (13.12.1; Dandekar,
1966, lix), and thereby launches his celibate grandfather Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma
into a tale that makes the case that the luckier ones are women.
But Yudhi:st:hira is hardly a simpleton. He is portrayed throughout
as having an underlying guilelessness that sustains him. The four
anthologies repeatedly reinforce this trope (see Hiltebeitel, press-e),
but nowhere more pivotally than in the transition from Book 12 to
74 The PS makes this connection by calling the Da(cid:1)nadharmaparvan the
A(cid:1)nu(cid:2)sa(cid:1)sanika,‘‘Further Instruction,’’at 1.2.65b.
75 Dandekar is quite insistent, going on: ‘‘the redactors must have seen in this
parvan perhaps their last opportunity to introduce into the epic various miscella-
neoustopicswhichhadoccurredtothematthelastmoment’’(idem,lxxiv–lxxv);and
rephrases this point in his Introduction to the Critical Notes (Anu(cid:2)sa(cid:1)sana vol. 2,
1051):‘‘SomeofthequestionsputintoYudhi:st:hira’smoutharesoelementarythat
they show the venerable king to be a naive person. They make one wonder if
Yudhi:st:hira had not learnt even commonplace things in the course of his long and
eventful life.’’
NOTWITHOUTSUBTALES:TELLINGLAWS 489
13, which marks Yudhi:st:hira’s revived interest in stories. He begins
Book 13 stating that he is unable to regain peace of mind, even
after Book 12, ‘‘out of the conviction that he alone had been
responsible for the tragic catastrophe of the war,’’ and that he feels
‘‘particularly unhappy at the pitiable condition’’ of Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma
(Dandekar, 1966, lvii–lviii). But once Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma reassures him in the
opening ‘‘Dialogue (Sam: va(cid:1)da) Between Death, Gautam(cid:1)(cid:3), and
Others’’ that fault is multiple and, as regards the war, certainly not
his alone, Yudhi:st:hira replies, ‘‘O grandsire, wisest of men, you
who are learned in all the treatises, I have listened to this great
narrative (a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na), O foremost of the intelligent. I desire to hear
a little more narrated by you in connection with dharma, O king.
You are able to narrate it to me. Tell me if any householder has
ever succeeded in conquering M:rtyu (Death) by the practice of
dharma’’ (13.2.1–3). This appeal launches Book 13’s first
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, the Sudars(cid:2)ana-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, on how, by following the
‘‘the law of treating guests’’ (atithidharma),76 Death may indeed be
overcome – a tale that reveals that the divine guest through whom
a householder can overcome Death by showing him unstinting
hospitality77 – even to the point of offering him his wife – is
Dharma himself.78 This would be a clever, beautiful, and relieving
76 Dandekar (1966, lviii) supplies this compound. The text speaks of atithipu(cid:1)ja(cid:1),
‘‘honoringorworshipingguests’’(13.2.68–69,91),asdoestheUn˜chav:rtti-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na
just before it (12.347.3) ending the Mok:sadharma, and the Kapota-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na
(12.142.39–40, 143.8) in the A(cid:1)paddharma. Cf. atithi-vratin, one who is ‘‘devoted to
guests,’’ in theMudgala-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na(3.246.4and15).
77 The atithi is not just an ordinary guest (abhya(cid:1)gata) but, etymologically, ‘‘one
who has no fixed day in coming’’ (Monier-Williams [1899] 1964, 14), that is, an
uninvited and ‘‘date-less’’ (a-tithi) guest. Thus Ganguli’s delightful note on the
Un˜chav:rtty-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na: ‘‘the word ‘atithi’ which is rendered ‘guest’ here and else-
where, means a person who enters without invitation the abode of a householder.

questioning, which leads Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma to tell him the Matan_ga-
Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na.81 This anticipatory theme of not ending at the end of a
story, of keeping the story going with a new story, comes up again
when Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma winds up the Vipula-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na by telling how
M(cid:1)arkan:d:eya had formerly told it to him ‘‘in the interval of a story

of the three S(cid:2)a(cid:1)ntiparvan anthologies, it is good to get back to
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas in ‘‘The Book of the Further Instruction.’’ This bears
further on the matter raised by Dandekar of returning to stories ‘‘no
matter if’’ they have ‘‘already occurred.’’ When Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma and
Yudhi:st:hira return to such stories – most notably the Vi(cid:2)sva(cid:1)mitra-
Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (13.3–4) with its familiar cast of revolving characters
(Vis´v(cid:1)amitra, Vasi:st:ha, Jamadagni, R(cid:1)ama J(cid:1)amadagnya, etc.)82 – it is
fromanewanddifferentangleand,asalwayswithanystory,fromthe
pleasure of hearing it again. There is thus a stronger case to be made
for reading Books 12 and 13, whole and in sequence, as part of the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s total design and earliest inspiration, than a develop-
mental anthology-by-anthology approach allows. As the return to
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas indicates, Book 13 goes well beyond the rules of trans-
formationthatFitzgeraldoffersasexplanationforsuchaprogression.
With Book 14, the A(cid:1)s(cid:2)vamedhikaparvan, Yudhi:st:hira, now adding

Dharma, that ever-demanding guest who would harbor not only this

abandon even at the cost of heaven. Yet this last lesson is not really
finished until Yudhi:st:hira curses dharma/Dharma out of anger
(18.2.42–45)at seeing Duryodhanain heaven,which bringshomethe
mongoose’s last lesson about how even Dharma leaves his anger be-
hindhim.Justso,asYudhi:st:hiraputshishumanfeelingsbehindhim,
he bathes in the heavenly Gan_g(cid:1)a and becomes ‘‘freed of enmity’’
(18.3.26–27,38–40).HereDharma,finallyinhisownform,revealsin

R(cid:1)ama J(cid:1)amadagnya, have, like other R::si stories in the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a,
often been viewed as ‘‘pura(cid:1)n:a’’-style (i.e., late) ‘‘digressions’’ or

families make invocation (pravara) when they give their line of des-
cent.91 Let us note further that this material is less pura(cid:1)n:a-like than
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata-like; it often folds within the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s one main
story material that the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata treats in its upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas.
Book 2, the Ayodhya(cid:1)ka(cid:1)n:d:a, builds up to the forest banishment of
R(cid:1)ama,accompaniedbyS(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)aandLak:sman:a.CrossingtheGan_g(cid:1)a,the
trio heads toward their first destination, the hermitage of the R::si

for an ashram in a secluded place,’’ the seer directs them to Mount
Citraku(cid:1)t:a,‘‘ameritoriousplacefrequentedbythegreatR::sis’’(2.48.25).
When Bharata learns what has happened, he affirms the Ik:sv(cid:1)akus’
custom of primogeniture, tells his deputies that he rather than R(cid:1)ama
will fulfill the terms of exile, and orders them to prepare an army to
help him bring R(cid:1)ama back. Following the same route, Bharata
reaches Bharadv(cid:1)aja’s ashram. Bharadv(cid:1)aja tests him, conjuring up a
feast for the army and a royal palace for him. Bharata rejects the
royal seat, foreshadowing his stewardship of R(cid:1)ama’s throne. Having
seen Bharata’s worthiness, Bharadv(cid:1)aja again gives directions to
Citraku(cid:1)t:a. There, after long discussion, Bharata agrees to be regent
for the duration of R(cid:1)ama’s exile.

R(cid:1)avan:a’s younger brother Khara has been cannibalizing ascetics in
nearby Janasth(cid:1)ana. The sages retreat to a safer ashram and R(cid:1)ama
moves on to the ashram of Atri, where Atri’s wife Anasu(cid:1)y(cid:1)a tells S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a
the duties of a faithful wife and gives her apparel and jewels.92 R(cid:1)ama
gets his next directions from the ascetics there, who recommend, all
other routes being treacherous, ‘‘the path through the forest that the
greatR::sisusewhentheygotogatherfruits’’(111.19).Withthisclose
of Book 2, adding Bharadv(cid:1)aja and Atri, R(cid:1)ama has now been linked
with seven of the eight pravara R::sis or their descendants. These
original seven, who together constitute the northern constellation of
the Seven R::sis (Big Dipper), have pointed R(cid:1)ama south.

The first line of Book 3, the Aran:yaka(cid:1)n:d:a, finds the trio entering
the ‘‘vast wilderness’’ of Dan:d:aka. As they move on from a circle of

Sut(cid:1)(cid:3)k:sn:a, who offers his ashram as a residence; but R(cid:1)ama says he
might kill the local game. The trio lives happily for 10 years in an-

The brothers head south on an ‘‘untrodden path’’ (3.65.2), passing
into the Kraun˜ca Forest, still hoping to find S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a. Instead they run
into a D(cid:1)anava-turned-R(cid:1)ak:sasa, Kabandha: ‘‘Headless trunk’’ but

grabbing arms that suddenly seize the brothers, who quickly sever
them. Realizing that this amputation by R(cid:1)ama ends a long curse,
Kabandha tells his story, and after R(cid:1)ama has asked if he knows
anything about R(cid:1)avan:a and has cremated the demon, Kabandha
rises lustrously from his pyre to say that R(cid:1)avan:a’s abode may be
found if R(cid:1)ama allies with the monkey Sugr(cid:1)(cid:3)va, whom R(cid:1)ama should
quickly make a friend and ‘‘commiserator’’ (vayasya). Kabandha

his disciples ascended to heaven just when R(cid:1)ama reached Citraku(cid:1)t:a,
but S´abar(cid:1)(cid:3) has awaited R(cid:1)ama’s arrival so that she can go to heaven
after seeing him. For this, R(cid:1)ama permits her to enter fire (70.26) –
indexing an association between fire-entry and purification that will
also apply to S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a.
Book 4, the Ki:skindha(cid:1)ka(cid:1)n:d:a, then begins with R(cid:1)ama exploring
Mount R::syamu(cid:1)ka, being met by Hanum(cid:1)an, and making Sugr(cid:1)(cid:3)va his
friendand commiseratorjust asKabandhahad advised.94 Inoffering

wronged him, which R(cid:1)ama accepts even before fully hearing it and
promises to kill V(cid:1)alin. The first part of Sugr(cid:1)(cid:3)va’s tale concerns his
falling out with V(cid:1)alin after V(cid:1)alin had killed the demon M(cid:1)ay(cid:1)avin,
which R(cid:1)ama accepts without question. But behind this story lies
another by which Sugr(cid:1)(cid:3)va discloses why Mount R::syamu(cid:1)ka provides

Sugr(cid:1)(cid:3)va now points to Dundubhi’s bones, which R(cid:1)ama kicks off to a
great distance with just his big toe. Matan_ga’s departure thus defines
his hermitage, along with Mount R::syamu(cid:1)ka, as a place cursed for its
pollution. Albeit that Matan_ga is a R::si, he is not a Vedic R::si or even
a Brahman. Rather, just as S´abar(cid:1)(cid:3)’s name denotes the Tribal, his
denotes the Untouchable. As with the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s Matan_ga-
Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na,95 Dundubhi’s killing has behind it a buffalo sacrifice – a
quite archaic one, with death by wrestling rather than the sword – in
which this ‘‘untouchable R::si’’ takes on the pollution of this non-
Vedic villagey rite.96

Matan_ga is thus denied R(cid:1)ama’s saving presence. On the other, since

The Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a’s Matan_ga is thus like the Potr(cid:1)aj a handler of the impurity of a

S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a when she first sees Hanum(cid:1)an and thinks she is dreaming, ‘‘a
monkey in a dream is held by all the (cid:2)sa(cid:1)stras to be inauspicious’’
[5.30.4; similarly 32.21]). This pattern recurs toward the end of Book
4 where one learns that 8000 years earlier (4.59.9), the R::si Nis´(cid:1)akara
(‘‘Night-Maker’’) welcomed Jat:(cid:1)ayus’s vulture brother Samp(cid:1)ati,
wingless after a misadventure, to his ashram where wild animals –
bears, deer, tigers, lions, elephants, and snakes – surrounded him as
they would a benefactor (da(cid:1)t:r). Like Matan_ga, he went to heaven
rather than wait to see R(cid:1)ama (61.15), and, although he could have
restored Samp(cid:1)ati’s wings, he left him wingless so he would have to
stay on the spot until it was time to benefit R(cid:1)ama. Samp(cid:1)ati is thus
there to see the monkey search party that is looking for S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a in the

In the Yuddha Ka(cid:1)nda (Book 6), R(cid:1)avan:a seems unable to focus on
R(cid:1)ama or the war until his wise maternal grandfather M(cid:1)alyav(cid:1)an,

155–171) that the king defines the age (yuga), says that throughout
the regions the R::sis are performing fiery Vedic rites and austerities
that are damaging the R(cid:1)ak:sasas, foresees the R(cid:1)ak:sasas ’ destruction,
and concludes, ‘‘I think R(cid:1)ama is Vi:sn:u abiding in a human body’’
(6.26.6–31). Getting it right, M(cid:1)alyav(cid:1)an calls attention to the R::sis’

the Bhagavad G(cid:1)ita(cid:1): a theology for the war about to happen; a pre-

stopping along the way at Bharadv(cid:1)aja’s ashram where Bharadv(cid:1)aja
recounts the trio’s whole adventure, which he knows by his penances
(6.112.14). R(cid:1)ama is at last enthroned in the presence of his rejoicing
family and people and the monkeys, R(cid:1)ak:sasas, and R::sis. Twice it is

But the Uttaraka(cid:1)n:d:a (Book 7) opens with R(cid:1)ama just consecrated
and a series of departures and dismissals. First, the R::sis come to his
palace–AgastyaandtheoriginalSevenamongthem(7.1.3–4).R(cid:1)ama
asks about the R(cid:1)ak:sasas he conquered, launching their former near-
neighbor Agastya on a lengthy R(cid:1)ak:sasa genealogy, with tales of
R(cid:1)avan:a’s boon and his violations of women, including what some
Northern manuscripts call the Vedavat(cid:1)i-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (7.17) (see above
n. 31). R(cid:1)ama is repeatedly filled wonder. Then ‘‘all the R::sis went as
they came’’ (36.46). R(cid:1)ama also dispatches a hundred kings, and the
R(cid:1)ak:sasas, monkeys, and bears – Hanum(cid:1)an parting with the famous
words: ‘‘As long as I hear Ra(cid:1)ma-katha(cid:1) on the face of the earth, so
long will my breaths reside in my body’’ (39.16). Next R(cid:1)ama
dismisses the Pu:spaka chariot while keeping it on call. And next he
dismisses S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a who will not remain on call. All these dismissals
subtract down to a great unraveling.
After some happiness between R(cid:1)ama and S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a, there comes the
news that Ayodhy(cid:1)a’s citizens gossip about her time in captivity, and

Appendix 1, no. 9; Shah, 1975, 26–27). When Bharata sees R(cid:1)ama, he
mentions nothing about V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki, S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a, or the twins.
Finding himself once again in Agastya’s hermitage after going by
the Pu:spaka to behead the S´u(cid:1)dra S´ ambu(cid:1)ka, R(cid:1)ama listens to more of
Agastya’s stories,100 and returns to Ayodhy(cid:1)a, again dismissing the
Pu:spaka.HenowtellsBharataandLak:sman:ahewishestoperforma
R(cid:1)ajasu(cid:1)ya sacrifice, but Bharata tells him a horse sacrifice is less
destructive and Lak:sman:a that the As´vamedha removes all sins and
purifies(75.2).R(cid:1)amaapprovestheAs´vamedha.HeordersLak:sman:a
tomakeinvitationstothemonkeysandR(cid:1)ak:sasas,andtotheregional
R::sis and their wives, and to prepare a vast sacrificial enclosure in the
Naimi:sa Forest. Bharata is to lead a procession trailed by all the
mothers from the inner apartments and ‘‘my golden wife (ka(cid:1)n˜can(cid:1)im
mamapatn(cid:1)im)worthyofconsecration(d(cid:1)ik:sa(cid:1))insacrificialrites’’(19).
S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a thus has a replacement-statue even while still alive.101 With the
sacrificeproceeding,V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)kisuddenlyarriveswithhisdisciples(84.1)
and directs the twins to sing ‘‘the whole Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a poem at the gate
ofR(cid:1)ama’sdwelling’’(3–5)–20sargasaday(9).R(cid:1)amahearstheboys
sing the first twenty sargas beginning ‘‘from the sight of N(cid:1)arada
(na(cid:1)rada-dars(cid:2)ana(cid:1)t)’’(11)–thatis,fromthebeginningoftheupodgha(cid:1)ta
on. Once the twins tell R(cid:1)ama who authored this poem that contains
his whole adventure (19), they offer to continue singing it at intervals
in the rite (21). After many days, R(cid:1)ama recognizes them, misses S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a,
and summons her to attest to her purity by oath in the midst of the
greatR::sis,R(cid:1)ak:sasas,andmonkeys,plusunnamedkingsandthefour
castes in thousands (87.6–7). But when V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki brings S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a he attests
to her purity himself (19), and tells R(cid:1)ama only that ‘‘she will give
proof of her fidelity’’ (15, 20). No longer demanding the oath just
announced, R(cid:1)ama accepts V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki’s word as tantamount to being
S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s: ‘‘Surely I have proof of fidelity in your stainless words. Surely
Vaideh(cid:1)(cid:3) gave proof of fidelity formerly in the presence of the gods’’
(88.2–3) – who by now have also come to witness (5–7). Indeed, in a
phrase that occurs nowhere else in either epic, this conclave occurs
‘‘inthemiddleoftheuniverse(jagatomadhye)’’(1,4).Notdemanded
to make an oath, S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a nonetheless makes one implicitly in her only

which buildsup toanaccount of the Dan:d:akaForest.
101 Amid these preparations, R(cid:1)ama, with a smile, tells Lak:sman:a what some
Northern manuscripts call the Id:a(cid:1)/Ila(cid:1)-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na (7.78–79) about a king who
alternates being male and female. Perhaps in S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s absence, R(cid:1)ama suggests a
curiosity aboutbisexual self-sufficiency.

and last words: ‘‘If I have thought with my mind of none other than
R(cid:1)ama, let the goddess M(cid:1)adhav(cid:1)(cid:3) [Earth] give me an opening …’’ (10).
R(cid:1)ama, who had hoped for ‘‘affection’’ (pr(cid:1)iti) from S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a (4), has thus
accepted the author’s word as S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a’s only to be overwhelmed with
griefandhorrorbywhatherword–andthepoet’s–actuallyis.This
is the moment at which he comes to realize what it means to be

destroy the Earth unless she returns S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a intact (7, Appendix I, No.

to the rest of this ‘‘first poem,’’ which will now tell what is still to
happen (21–40). Once Brahm(cid:1)a returns to heaven, the R::sis in Brah-
maloka obtain his permission to return for the rest as well (43–49).

edition rejects this sarga, it does so only on the grounds that without
it ‘‘the continuity of the narration … is not hampered and appears in

converse, the congenitally ravenous ‘‘blessed R::si Durv(cid:1)asas’’ (95.1b),
familiar from the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s Mudgala-Upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na,103 tries to
barge in, threatening to curse the kingdom if he is prevented.
Lak:sman:a chooses his own death rather than allowing that of others
and admits him. Durv(cid:1)asas only wants something to eat after a
thousand-year fast, which R(cid:1)ama happily provides. At Vasi:st:ha’s
advice R(cid:1)ama then banishes Lak:sman:a as equivalent to death, and
Lak:sman:a, meditating by the Sarayu(cid:1) River, is taken up to heaven.

UPA(cid:1)KHYA(cid:1)NA PRECEDENCE AND THE ESSENCE OF THEM ALL
The relation between the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a and the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s
Ra(cid:1)mopa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na is usually posed as one between just these two
SanskritR(cid:1)amastories,andasaquestionofwhetherthereisagenetic
relation between them. Which came first? Or do both rely on some
prior Ra(cid:1)makatha(cid:1)? On these questions, this article’s position is two-
fold.First,theprimaryrelationisnotbetweentheRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:aandthe
Ra(cid:1)mopa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na, but between the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a and the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata,
which it views as the slightly earlier of the two quite possibly over-
lappingprojects.Onthispoint,itwasnotedthattheirsimilardesigns
couldnotbeaccidental.Itiseasierto imagineV(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)kirefiningka(cid:1)vya
outofamulti-genreMaha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)ratathantoimagineVy(cid:1)asaoverlooking
this achievement to spread disarticulation. In this vein, the
Ra(cid:1)mopa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na opens with material about R(cid:1)avan:a that the
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a saves for Book 7. It thus cannot be explained as an epit-
ome of the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a, since it lacks the structure that the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a
shares with the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata.
Second, this article holds that it is helpful to reflect on how
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)namaterialisusedinbothepics.Asobserved,theRa(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a
uses this term only in an interpolation and in Northern Recension
colophons. Rather than having stand-out ‘‘subtales,’’ the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a
folds all its secondary narratives into one consecutively unfolding
poem.Thisisespeciallynoteworthyinitsstoriesabouttheeightgreat
R::sis encountered by R(cid:1)ama, many of which include material that the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata relates in its upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas. Other than mentioning

Vasi:st:ha, a fixture in the Ik:sv(cid:1)aku house, the Ra(cid:1)mopa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na doesnot
know these R::sis. It has no R:s´yas´:rn_ga, Vis´v(cid:1)amitra, Gautama and
Ahaly(cid:1)a, R(cid:1)ama J(cid:1)amadagnya, or for that matter Vasi:st:ha involved in
the stories from birth through marriage; just this: ‘‘In the course of
time[Das´aratha’s]sonsgrewupveryvigorous,andbecamefledgedin
the Vedas and their mysteries and in the art of archery. They com-
pletedtheirstudentyears,andtookwives’’(Mbh3.261.4–5).Ithasno
Bharadv(cid:1)aja;justthisofBharata:‘‘HefoundR(cid:1)amaandLak:sman:aon
Mount Citraku(cid:1)t:a’’ (216.63). And from Citraku(cid:1)t:a on, there is not a
peep from Atri and Anasu(cid:1)y(cid:1)a or Agastya. There is also no V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)k(cid:1)(cid:3),
Matan_ga, or Nis´(cid:1)akara. It is improbable that the Ra(cid:1)mopa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na
would have strained out all these figures and episodes if it were a
Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a epitome. V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki would seem to have worked such
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na material into something he claims to be new: ka(cid:1)vya, ‘‘the
first poem.’’ And this would seem to be the best way to think about
what he did with the Ra(cid:1)mopakhya(cid:1)na: go beyond it to author a poem
in which R(cid:1)ama and S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a move through their double adventure along
paths signposted by R::sis who impart Vedic authority to new values
about dharma centered on bhakti as a servant–master relation of
subjects to a divinity-embodying king. These knowing Vedic R::sis
represent ‘‘all the R::sis’’ high and low who motivate this divine
incarnation to cleansethe world of noxious R(cid:1)ak:sasas,and ultimately
come to hear out his story to the end. And they in turn are repre-
sented by V(cid:1)alm(cid:1)(cid:3)ki himself who frames all the paths that R(cid:1)ama and
S(cid:1)(cid:3)t(cid:1)a take as ones that begin with his inspiration to tell their adven-
tures in a poem that will lead them ultimately back to him.
As to the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, we began with the question of what a
‘‘Bha(cid:1)rata’’ without upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas might have signified, and looked at
how and where upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas are woven into the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata. There
is,however,oneotherreferencetotheepic’supa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nasthatisyetto
be plumbed. It occurs toward the end of Book 12 in the highly
devotional Na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:(cid:1)iya, and takes us back where we began: to the
‘‘oceanic mind’’ of the author, and also to the A(cid:1)st(cid:1)ikaparvan substory
called‘‘TheChurningoftheOcean’’(1.15–17).104Onemayalsorecall
that on the last day of the war, Duryodhana, hiding from the
P(cid:1)an:d:avas to recuperate, finds his last relief by magicially concealing
104 Of which the Ra(cid:1)ma(cid:1)yan:a has a short version as well (1.44.13–27). The
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata provides no genre term or independent title for its ‘‘Churning of the
Ocean’’ story; seeGombach(2000,II, 11,n. 9).

himself in anotherwise unheard of Dvaip(cid:1)ayana Lake (9.29.53a):that
is, a lake bearing the name of the author.105
About one third through the Na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:(cid:1)iya, itself an 18-chapter
epitome of the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata (although the Critical Edition splits a
chapter and makes it nineteen [12.321–339]),106 Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma says that the
story he has just told Yudhi:st:hira about N(cid:1)arada’s journey to ‘‘White
Island’’ (S´vetadv(cid:1)ipa) – an island somewhere on the northern shore of
the milky ocean107 – is a ‘‘narrative (a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nam) coming from a seer-
based transmission (a(cid:1)r:seyam pa(cid:1)ramparya(cid:1)gatam) that should not be
given’’ to anyone who is not a Vi:sn:u devotee (12.326.113), and,
moreover, that it is the ‘‘essence’’ of all the ‘‘other upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas’’ he
has transmitted:
Of those hundreds of other virtuous subtales (anya(cid:1)ni … upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na(cid:2)sata(cid:1)ni …

raised upby thesages (12.326.114–115).
Hearing this, Yudhi:st:hira and all the P(cid:1)an:d:avas become N(cid:1)ar(cid:1)ayan:a
devotees (326.121). This suggests that one could count the ‘‘White
Island’’storyasa68thupa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na.Furthermore,Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):smaholdsthatit
is the essence of them all. He has also used a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na and upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na
interchangeably with each other and with katha(cid:1), story. And when he
speaks of the ‘‘hundreds of other virtuous upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas that are heard
from me,’’ he probably implies not only those he has just told
Yudhi:st:hira in the S(cid:2)a(cid:1)ntiparvan, but all the others he has told or will
tell elsewhere, and those that have been recited by others, which

Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma, given his many heavenly and earthly sources,108 would
almost certainly know as well.
Still within the Na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:(cid:1)iya, just after its next major narrative on
prav:rtti and niv:rtti, S´aunaka109 says to Ugras´ravas:
OSauti,verygreatisthenarrative(a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na)recitedbyyou,havingheardwhich,the
sages are all gone to the highest wonder.110 … Surely having churned the supreme
ocean of knowledge by this hundred thousand (verse) Bha(cid:1)rata narrative with the
churning of your thought (idam: s(cid:2)atasahasra(cid:1)d hi bha(cid:1)rata(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na vistara(cid:1)t/ a(cid:1)mathya

so is this supreme nectar of story (katha(cid:1)m:rtam) … raised up [as] spoken by you,
which rests onthe storyof N(cid:1)ar(cid:1)ayan:a (na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:akatha(cid:1)(cid:2)srayam)(12.331.1–4).
Although S´aunaka commends Ugras´ravas for ‘‘having churned the
supreme ocean of knowledge by this hundred thousand (verse)
Bha(cid:1)rata-a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na with the churning of your thought’’ (that is,
Ugras´ravas’s), we must remember that Ugras´ravas is only said to be
transmitting the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata to the Naimi:sa Forest R::sis as the
‘‘entire thought’’ of Vy(cid:1)asa (1.1.23). This suggests that the full hun-
dred thousand verses – with the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas included – of the
Bha(cid:1)rata-a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)na were churned first by Vy(cid:1)asa before they were
rechurned by Ugras´ravas, with Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana, their intermediary,111
having also delivered Vy(cid:1)asa’s ‘‘entire thought’’ (1.55.2) at Janame-
jaya’s snake sacrifice, where Ugras´ravas overheard it.
Then, still within the Mok:sadharma anthology of the S(cid:2)a(cid:1)ntiparvan,
before these two passages but leading up to the story of S´uka
(12.310–320), there is a third passage that uses the same metaphor
and similes. It occurs within Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma’s account of the lengthy
instructionthatVy(cid:1)asagiveshisfirstbornsonS´ uka(12.224–246),who
is not only one of Vy(cid:1)asa’s five disciples (Vais´amp(cid:1)ayana being an-

S´ uka would also be churned up from all the a(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas – presumably
of the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata, which would imply as well the upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nas and
likewise imply that this ‘‘treatise’’ for his son epitomizes the
Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata itself.115 S´uka’s agenda of seeking liberation (mok:sa) is
set here, and he attains mok:sa toward the end of Book 12 as a boy,
just before the Na(cid:1)ra(cid:1)yan:(cid:1)iya and its sequel: Bh(cid:1)(cid:3):sma’s grand run of
upa(cid:1)khya(cid:1)nasfromBook12into Book13.Takingthepassageliterally,
it seems to say that Vy(cid:1)asa churned all the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s narratives
about dharma and truth for the sake of S´uka’a liberation, the very
thing that Yudhi:st:hira, shortly after hearing that story, accepts that
he must do without while asking for further stories.
These churning passages are heightened reflections on at least two
of the purposes of narrative within the Maha(cid:1)bha(cid:1)rata’s overall grand
design: that it all rests on N(cid:1)ar(cid:1)ayan:a, and that its essence is liberating
instructiononbothtruthanddharma.Theywouldseemtoreflectthe
exuberant overview from within of some of those who were involved
in the production of the earliest totality of this work.
