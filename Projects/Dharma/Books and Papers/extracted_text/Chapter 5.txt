the Mahābhārata. New York: Oxford University Press, 2013.
In Disorienting Dharma, Emily T. Hudson reads the Mahābhārata from the
perspective of its “aesthetics of suffering.” By this she means “the ways in which
the epic’s literary devices, or narrative strategies, use the theme of suffering to
impact its audiences in ethically significant ways” (6). According to Hudson, the
Mahābhārata“operatesasaliterarytext…morethroughwhatit‘does’thanthrough
what it says, that is by ‘doing’ something to its audience” (5). The specific action
undertakenbythetextisthatit“bringsitsaudiencestothebrinkofmeaninglessness
andthen,insteadofrecedingfromit,ittoys withpushingthem overthe precipice”
(26). This, Hudson contends, is where the “real work” (60, 96) of the epic is done,
because,throughthisexperience,wecometorealizethat“afundamentalfeatureof
human life is suffering on a monumental scale and nothing, not even dharma, can
protect us from this fact” (220, see also 222).
Hudson argues that, by forcing us to confront the “truth of universal suffering”
(72, see also 31, 34, 39, 44, 45, 68, 69, 108, 178, 179, 196, 219, 221) and the fact
thatwe,ashumans,“haveadesperateneedtorationalizesuffering(inordertoavoid
confronting it)” (216), the Mahābhārata’s “aesthetics of suffering” helps us see
throughtheunsatisfactorynatureofeverytheodicy.Weseethat“sufferingexists…
andthatisit.Sufferingisnotaphenomenonthatcanbeunderstood,orjustified,or
rationalized away; it simply exists” (215). Further, we see that concepts like
dharma,farfromhelpinguscopewithsorrow,areactuallyresponsibleformuchof
our suffering in that: (i) “the path of dharma” itself turns out to be implicated in

“sufferingandsorrow”(7);(ii)byholdingouttheprospectofamoralorderorofa
justification,dharma“blind[s]ustothepervasiveexistenceofsuffering”(103);and
(iii) as a consequence, dharma actually causes us to suffer more, for “the person
whoseeksthiskindofarationaleforsufferingisthepersonwhorefusestofacethe
harshrealityoflife,thatsufferingexistssimplyandtotally…”(215).Thisraisesan
all-important question: “If the path of dharma not only does not protect one from
misfortuneandsorrow,but,onthecontrary,potentiallyisimplicatedintheproblem
of suffering, is the dharmic path even a noble or worthy pursuit?” (103).
This is the central question of Hudson’s book, and she tries to answer it by
showing how characters who pursue dharma in the epic are inevitably frustrated.
Herconclusionisexpectablypessimistic:conceptssuchasdharma“donotprovide
uswith theconceptual clarity andsecurity thatwelong for”(103).Although many
characters in the epic operate under the “illusion…that dharma will protect them
from suffering[,] [t]he reality in the world of the text is that nothing protects one
from suffering” (32, see also 33, 220, and 222). Indeed, “the notion of dharma
performedfor thesake ofsomething, particularlyforthe sakeofacquiring meritto
safeguard one from misfortune—either in this life or beyond” turns out to be “a
fundamentally flawed conception of dharma” (219). Thus, if we wish in the future
“torecoveradeeper,truerunderstandingofdharma,”wemustbe“reorientedtoan
understanding of it that would be divested of all pretenses of security” (103–4).
“One would,” Hudson concludes, “according to the logic of this understanding of
the concept, follow dharma for the sake of nothing” (104, see also 32).
This is a radical thesis and Hudson’s approach of reading the Mahābhārata
through the lens of its performative aspect is an interesting idea. In practice,
however, both the thesis and the approach are seriously flawed. The Mahābhārata
explicitlycallsitselfadharmatext(1.1.19c,47a,1.56.16a,21a,33a),committedto
upholding and explaining the normative dharma. It does not share Hudson’s
skepticism regarding the possibility of dharma; indeed, it could be asked whether
such a rejection is at all possible within Indian thought. As “the cosmically or
‘religiously’determinedactivityofallexistingbeingstomaintainthenormalorder
of the world,” dharma simply refers, maximally, to the innate propensity of all
beings to act in accordance with their natures (Van Buitenen 1957: 36). “It is the
dharmaofthesuntoshine,ofthepoletobefixed,oftheriverstoflow,ofthecowto
yieldmilk,ofthebrahmintoofficiate,ofthekṣatriyatorule,ofthevaiśyatofarm”
(VanBuitenen1957:36).Asanāstikatext,theMahābhārataexplicitlylocatesitself
within this long tradition of Indian thought (see 1.1.19a, 191a, 204). It regards
dharma in this sense as the cosmic background, the sine qua non of its specific
inquiry into the obligations and duties of the various varṇas, especially as the
dharma declines in the Kali Yuga (1.58.3–34). Next to the Manusmṛti (which it
frequentlyinvokes),1thereisnootherworkascentralfortheformulationofdharma

EthicsandHermeneuticsintheMahābhārata
Hudson also misunderstands the way dharma operates in the epic. Although she
repeatedly asserts that it fails to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of
human suffering, she does not clarify which sense of dharma she means. The
Mahābhārata distinguishes between pravṛtti dharma, the dharma of activity, and
nivṛtti dharma, the dharma of renunciation (12.322.3a and 12.327.2–4).2 At the
level of pravṛtti dharma, there is no final answer to suffering, though certain
compensations(forexample,thebirthofachild,thejoyofanencounter,andsoon)
exist. If all that Hudson means by the statement that dharma “fails” is that pravṛtti
dharmaisnotafinalsolutiontotheproblemofhumanexistence,sheisquiteright.
Butthisismerelystatingtheobvious.TheMahābhārataisawareofthefinitenature
of pravṛtti dharma. It repeatedly emphasizes the temporary nature of worldly
success, using the dicing game as a metaphor for this in the text.3 Repeated
statements about the impermanence of wealth, power, or fortune—many of them
scatteredthroughthepostdicingĀraṇyakaparvan(see,forexample,S´aunaka’sbrief
sermon;3.2.15–48)—reinforce themessage.Theepicusesthisfinitude asawayto
open up the nivṛtti axis. Here, there really is an answer to the problem of human
suffering, but it is an answer that requires going beyond the kind of “aesthetic”
lamentation Hudson’s book emphasizes.
Surprisingly for a work that claims to embody a “hermeneutics of respect” that
“seekstolistentoratherthandisembowelthetext”(20),Hudson’sbookhacksaway
atmostofthetext.Sheneveroncementionstheconceptofnivṛttidharma.Shealso
sets aside all the other essential elements of the Mahābhārata’s soteriological
response to the problem of pravṛtti: prādurbhūti, bhārāvataraṇa, avataraṇa,
devarahasya, bhakti, krīḍa,4 yugānta, the devāsura conflict, and the vision of
Becoming as a raṇa yajña through which are born both jñāna and mokṣa. Having
snappedthetext’sspinalcordofideas,shethenlamentsthat“thetextdoesnotgrant
us the solace of divine retribution, or justice, or even an explanation for the
tremendoussufferingthatmanyofthecharactersendured”(214–15).Moreover,she
insists that the Mahābhārata is trying to get us to see a “fundamental truth of
existence: the truth ofuniversalsuffering” (219, see also72) and claims that—asa
consequence—“academic discussion of ethics in the Mahābhārata should be de-
centered from the topic of dharma and re-centered on the issue of suffering,
particularlyontherelationshipbetweensufferinganddharma”(49,seealso35and

224). These claims would be credible if Hudson could account for the fact that, in
the concept of nivṛtti dharma, the epic has a sophisticated response to the problem
ofhumansuffering.Byignoringkeycomponentsoftheepic’sproject,Hudsonlives
up neither toher claim to take the Mahābhārata seriouslyas “a work of literature”
(4)nortoherclaimtohaveshownthatsufferingis“theprimaryaestheticgroundfor
ethics in the epic” (49, 224). In fact, this claim appears to be true only because
Hudson considers suffering only from an “aesthetic” (that is, disinterested)
perspective:consequently,itnowappearsasthoughtheepic’sonlyanswerconsists
in its “stark revelation of the structure of the world” (49).5
Even at the level of pravṛtti dharma, Hudson’s analysis is problematic. She sets
aside the theme of adharma (unrighteousness, injustice, irreligion, wickedness),
eventhough,withinpravṛtti,itisimpossibletoformulatedharmawithoutseeingit
in its relationship to adharma. As V. S. Sukthankar notes, what gives the
Maha¯bha¯rataWarits“realdepthandsignificanceistheprojectionofthestoryonto
a cosmic background, by its own interpretation of the Bha¯rata War as a mere
incident in the ever recurring struggle between the Devas and the Asuras; in other
words,asamerephaseincosmicevolution”(1957:62).Thiscosmicbackgroundis
akeyelementintheepic’sexplorationofthedynamicsofdharma.Notonlydoesit
permit the epic to explain the reality of adharma (as the result of egotism and the
shortsightedseeking ofone’sadvantage),butitalsopermits ittoillustratethefinal
triumph of dharma (with the destruction of the asurasand the reestablishment ofa
justorder).Hudson,however,viaareferencetoSimonBrodbeck’swork,6removes
thisontologicaldimensionfromthetext.7Sheattributesalltheproblemsinthetext

contrastbetweenthetext’scontentandform,asinequanonofher“aesthetic”approachtotheepicof
setting aside its doctrines; and (2) that she is carrying out even this “aesthetic” approach from the

therewillalwaysbeaviolationofdharma;attheādhidaivikalevel,aprotectionof
dharma;butitisonlyattheādhyātmikalevelthattherecanbeafullvindicationof
dharma through achieving emancipation.8
The epic is aware of these aspects. It sets up the conflict over dharma
(dharmayuddha; 7.164.1c, 10.9.23a) in order to clarify, within the context of a
confusion over the meaning of dharma (dharmasaṃmūḍha; 6.24.7a), the utmost
importanceofholdingontodharma.Further,throughanapocalypticwar,itclarifies
that the unjust are destroyed and that the just triumph even on a temporal plane.
Indeed,thereisnoprincipletheepiccouldbesaidtobemorecommittedtothanthe
idea that where there is dharma, there is victory.9 Hudson, however, sets aside
adharma as the counterconcept to dharma and generates a perverse thesis. Rather
than seeing that suffering is the result of a violation of dharma, she attributes the
presenceofsufferingtodharmaitself.IntheMahābhārata,Draupad¯ı’sdishonoring
in the Kuru assembly hall is the paradigmatic example of how individuals, drunk
with lust or power, perpetrate injustice. Yet, rather than condemn the Kauravas for
theircruelty,Hudsonscapegoatsdharmainstead.Thus,shedeclaresthatDraupad¯ı’s
“virtue fail[s] her; dharma fails her” (99). Hudson has not understood the basic
distinctionbetweendharmaandadharma.Shedoesnotseethatdharmaprotectsby
saving the soul’s virtue and not by making one immune to aggression.10 She also
does not understand that there is such a thing as innocent suffering, caused by the
injusticeofothersorthatthosewhoperpetrateadharmaareultimatelypunishedfor
their transgression. In issuing a blanket condemnation of the principle of dharma
itself,shecreatesafalsedichotomy(‘eitherthereshouldbenoadharmawhatsoever
in the world, or dharma has failed’). Dharma exists in a constant struggle with
adharma,but, even underpain ofdeath,oneoughtnotabandonthe right path.11In

see also Mahābhārata 3.187.26]), she uses the dharmasaṃśaya (uncertainty or
doubt about dharma) to undermine the very notion of dharma. Adopting the blind
Dhrtara¯stra, the king who enables much of the adharma in the epic as her
˙ ˙˙
spokesperson,12 she argues for a similar moral relativism.13 Like the king, she
invokestheuniversalityofsufferingasawaytofrustratetheepic’smoralargument.
Her argument, which sets aside the role of personal responsibility in one’s
misfortunes, is a perfect restatement of the king’s views in the Mahābhārata.14
Blind and blinded by his lust for power and his attachment to a wicked son,
Dhrtara¯straisnotatragicfigure,asHudsonclaims(69,106).Rather,heisaVrtra-
˙ ˙˙ ˙
like15 figure who uses pretended doubts about dharma as a way to avoid doing the
right thing.16 As readers of the Mahābhārata, are we really supposed to read the
epic from the perspective of this king whose very name suggests a lust for the
kingdom (dhṛtam rāṣṭram yena saḥ), a lust that triumphs over even his professed
love for his son?

and the book that contains essential hermeneutic instructions on reading the
Mahābhārata (see Adluri 2011, 2013), such as the motif of the descent of the
dharma-minded S´esa to uphold the earth (dhārayat, 1.32.21c; the word is
˙
etymologically related to dharma through the root dḥr) and of the cursing of
Dharma to be born from a S´u¯dra’s womb (1.57.77–81 and 1.101.1–28), is barely
mentioned.ThiswouldbeworryinginanintroductiontotheMahābhārata;inatext
that claims to be “one of the first book-length studies to view the subject [that is,

led nearly two generations of scholars astray (see Adluri and Bagchee 2014,

earlier generation of German scholars on the epic, above all, their theories of “oral
transmission,” which gave them license to neglect the text as it exists for a fantasy
epic of their own devising.18 Likewise, she places no trust in their fabricated
histories of the text (for example, its “heroic” origins, its “corruption” by the
Bra¯hmanas,thefusionof“epic”with“didactic”elements,andsoon).Infact,where
˙
I found problems with her work they were primarily due to her recurrence to
nineteenth-century attitudes to Indian texts: reading them selectively, reading them
withouttheguidanceofanauthoritativetradition,andreadingtheminordertofind
meanings at variance with the received interpretation.19
