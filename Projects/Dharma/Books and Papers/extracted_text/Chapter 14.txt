Since 1991, I have known I was headed toWard writing a secood book
Abbre\1'an'OIlS 323 abont the Mahablzarata. It took irs twists and turns, but it has been an
exciting time to be writing a book about this text. Bookended at the
Bibliography 325 beginning by the ninety-three segments of "Mababbarata" on Indian
national television and at the eod by the resumption after over twenty
Index 351 yearsoftheUniversity ofChicago Press's MahabhtiraUl ttanslation, one
couldalmost call ita decade offennem. Ithas beena lime ofdeepening
awareness ofthe Mahablzarata, for sbarpening arguments about it, and
for respectful and pleasurable exchange of scholarly views as to its
charactet. Withthatinwind, Isimplywisbtothankallthosewith whom

preruise, aired most magisterially by Moriz Winternitz and Hermann
Oldenberg, that the Mahabhlirata is a "literary nothing" (literarisches
Unding),l a"monstrouschaos" (ungeheuerliches Chaos).' Althoughour
time is now one in which "literary monstrosity" ruight imply akind of
artistry (one thinks first ofHenryJarnes writing on the artofthe novel
as "such large loose and baggy monsters"),' the phrase is simply not
adequate to thecritical task. Nonetheless, thepreruiseofmonstrosityhas
served a purpose. It has allowed scholars ofvery different persuasions
and interests to design a MahabhiJrata ofconvenience throughwhich to
nurture-withmorebombastthandebate, andwithscarcelyanythingthat
could be called cumulative results-their own contradictory notions of
origins and theirequally contradictory developmental theories.
Rather than continuing to invest in these assumptions, we ruight
considerhowwe bavecome to fnrm them. Muchoftheirunderpinnings
derive-to carry on with Hans Georg Gadarner-from a concurrence of

The Author inthe Works 33
2 The 'Author in the Works Foucault's applicability is not negligible. First, regarding the ways that
the "author function" appropriates discourses (including epic),' he sees
that these will "vary with eachculture" (158) andhave a histoty inany
given culture (141). Although Vedic hymns have "family books" and
named poets, about whom legends have in many cases formed,' and
a1rhough certain names take ona representative quasi-authorial function
for teachings andtexts withindifferent oral branches ofVediclearning,'
for Indian literature, the "individualization" (141) ofauthors-divine,
fictional, or otherwise(147)-first takes onllteraty proportions inearly
post- and para-Vedicsmrti texIS.' Among these, rhe two Sanskrit epics
tackle the project of "author-construction" (150) most daringly by
portraying new anthors involved in their own stories'-in the
MaMbharata, by giving, as Mehtaputs it, the "hint" ofa "mysterious

The frame story has been noticed at its possible inception in the

MahiJblUJraJa by Minkowski (1989), as a feature of the epic's literary
composition by Snktbankat (1936, 72), or its written redaction by
Mangels,' Oberlies,' and Reich.' Both Witzel and Minkowski suggesl

In a plainly Marxist study, Walter Ruben finds that "fighting against
despots in old Indian literature" "plays a fairly big role" (1968, II).
Sampling the epics, pl1Iii¥as, and some other texts, he lists thirty-<>ne
literarydespotsbeginningwithDoryodbana,IUvaJ1'l,Karnsa,Jarasandba,
andArjuoa~vIrya(all from theepics), andendswiththeobservation
thatonly one, "Sarviirtbasiddhi, the last Naoda, was anhistorical king"
(Il4). Theotherthirtyare "mythological" (Ill). Heconcludesthatthere
was "no revolutionary class in ancientIndia," and that, wliileBrahman
literatures (including the epics) encouraged kings to be noodespotic and
BuddhistUtakas evenenvisionedmass resistance, the people "suffering
under despotism" were "consoled with religious stories" (Il6-17).
TIlming to history, be runs througb the record ofpatricides and other
assassinations that distinguisbearly imperial Magadba, and suggescs the
implications ofdtis history for Indianmythology.
Aocording to Buddhist tradition BimbisWiofMagadbawas killedby
his son Aj~~ttuand the four following kings were also patricides;
then the people supplanted dUs dynasty of murderous despots by
electing the ministerSis_gaas king. The last Saisunagawas killed

Draupadr's Question 241
7 Draupadl's Question scene that provokes it: that it has to do not only with the selfof King
Dharma (Yudhi~!hira), but the "subtle" selforessence ofdharma, and
that the sceoo provokes two expressions about what is the "highest
dharma." To BhIma, about to burn Yu~!hira'sarms, Ariana says the
highest dharma is to remember not to overstep one's eldest brother
(bhrawaT(l dJUJrmiklm:r jye.r~ niltikramitum arhan; 2.61.8cd)-a
somewhat troubling point, since he says this to his own older (if not
eldest)brotherBhima.· Andfor Vidura, itisspeakingwhatisapplicable

First, Himavat, the mountain that has shaken at the breath of the two peaks might "meet" or "come togemer," as some others haveread
snoozing Vj~u, "seems to split" when Suleaapproaches it. Letting this it." As the story itselfhas made clear during Suka's long descent "on

what may well be one of Vyasa's enigma verses. What "seems" to be· wonder acrually is. Itis DOt what Sulea has done but what he has seen:
happening, jfwe take the language most simply and keep sequence in "The two were seen, 0 Mab~raja; that was like awonder." But whatis
mind, is that Himavat, which hadjust "seemedto split," is nowseenas the wonder? Is it that he saw the two mountains where one ordinarily
a single divine peak become douhle, an imponderable mass, perhaps onlysees one, Himavat? Or is it that what he saw is reponed, and that

themountainalone: "Withunhesitatingmind, Sukathenrushed forward "foremoSt ofmountains" (parvatllgram) thathis son, now "gone," had
into the double mountain peak, suddenly rending it." In other words, just divided. It is not certain whether Vyasa still sees the mountain
whatlimseenwltosplit-perhapstomany-isDOWsplit,andseemingly divided after this "bare moment," or whether he has just missed the
seen, by Sukaalone. To the yogin as he breaks through to liberation, it division." Whatis clear is that themoiiDtain that the yogin sees double

distinctive faces ofboth; one mountain that is bOlh Himavat and Meru mountain that obstructs the father's access to the son." But which
